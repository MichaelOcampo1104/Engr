TEXT DISCLAIMER
Although every effort has been made to interpret the references cited correctly, there is no warranty
express or implied that the interpretation is correct. If there is a question of whether the
interpretation has been correctly made, the reader should consult the appropriate reference. There is
also no warranty that every equation in the text has been correctly typeset. There are inevitably a
few errors between the time equations re first written and when they get into print. It is the user's
responsibility to check the results of any equation that has been used and, if the results do not seem
reasonable, to use the textbook explanation (or original reference) to see if the equation can be
derived. To catch equation errata the author, in addition to presenting the equation, has usually used
the equation in an example.

COMPUTER PROGRAM DISCLAIMER
Neither the publisher nor the author warrants the included programs to execute other that the
displayed output if the data are correctly entered into the computer. Any use of these programs to
solve problem other that those displayed or for which data sets are provided is the sole responsibility
of the user. This includes making a correct problem model, obtaining the necessary input data
(including any estimated values), and interpreting the output.

PREFACE

This fifth edition continues the format of the previous four editions for providing current
state-of-art (SOA) and state-of-practice (SOP) methods in Foundation Engineering. From
author-user interaction I have concluded that SOP tends to lag SOA on the average of about
10 years. There is a range, however, where a few larger organizations are at the cutting edge
of technology and many—particularly the smaller firms—are at varying intermediate stages.
This textbook, which is also widely used as a practitioner's reference, includes SOP
material but with major emphasis on SOA. The latter is accomplished by including a mix
of practice, "how to," and latest suggested design/analysis methodology. This produces a
text compatible with the general goals of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)
and other professional organizations, which have determined that technical graduates have a
postgraduate period of only 5 to 7 years before obsolescence becomes a factor in their practice.
Design methods tend to vary between geographic regions, partly from instructors' influ-
ences and partly because there are few "design absolutes." As a consequence it is necessary
to include the generally accepted alternative methods but to temper these with recommen-
dations and suggestions on their use. This allows the user access to regional differences and
provides "averaged" design results or the option to select the most appropriate alternative on
a site-specific basis. Although these comments may appear overly practice-oriented, the fact
is that the student must be aware of these real-world conflicts, geographical differences, and
alternatives so as to be productive upon graduation.
This book emphasizes computer methods and the Finite-Element Method (FEM), in-
volving matrix methods given in the previous editions, to reflect the widespread use of the
personal computer and of the FEM in practice. Be aware, however, that the finite-element
method does not have a unique definition. To some practitioners it is any mathematical rep-
resentation of the continua (beams, plates, or solids) using discrete (or finite) elements. To
other practitioners the FEM definition is reserved only for modeling the soil mass and the in-
terfacing structural elements—sometimes this is called "soil-structure interaction" modeling.


In this textbook the former definition is used, for it is the one that is most widely practiced
and given in most textbooks devoted solely to the FEM.
This textbook gives sufficient background theory for a FEM model so that the average
user should have little difficulty using this method for design/analysis of those types of soil-
structure interfacings used herein. It does make the modest assumption that most students at
the level of this textbook have been exposed to some FEM and matrix methodology in statics;
elementary structures; and the required university-level math courses. As a further aid there
are computer programs (already compiled on an accompanying diskette) so the user does not
have to become involved in FEM programming to use the methodology given.

WHAT'S NEW
This book has been substantially revised to include appropriate new material and expanded
discussion of previous material. A large number of figures have been modified and several
new ones added. I was able to do this with only a small increase in the total page count
since providing the computer programs on diskette freed for text pages that had been used
for program listings. Specifically these changes include but are not limited to the following:

a. Revision of text examples and problems so they are all in SI. Only two or three exceptions
occur in examples that were originally published in Fps and for which a user would have
to put forth too much effort to reconvert the material for verification.
b. I added five additional computer programs to the basic package so there are now 16 on
the diskette. Nearly all of the data sets for the examples used in the textbook that can be
used with the included programs are also on the program diskette. These will be extremely
valuable for users to obtain computer output quickly in a more readable size. A number
of problems at the ends of chapters are based on the user making a copy of the included
data file for editing and execution.
c. I have revised the problems so that if an applicable computer program is on the diskette it
will have to be used.
d. I have corrected several equations and figures from the previous edition.
e. I have revised the method for footings with overturning (in Chapter 8) to use the method-
ology first proposed by Meyerhof in 1953 for both bearing capacity and for the actual base
design.
/ I have enlarged the discussion on lateral pressures in Chapter 11.
g. I have generally improved on the example format so that the computations are easier to
follow.

The book is not a literature survey, but an extensive reference list is required to sup-
plement and lend authority to the material presented as well as to give professional credit to
those contributing to the advance in knowledge and practice. Because of text space I have
had to limit use of references to seldom more than one or two for any topic covered. How-
ever, I tried to cite references that contained the most recent and most extensive reference
lists so that the interested reader can easily make any follow-up verification or background
fill-in with only a minimal literature search effort. If limiting the reference list has omitted
any important contribution, I am sincerely regretful. Also I hope that junior authors are not
offended by the practice of using "et al." where there are more than two coauthors.


A broad range of subject matter is necessary if one is to achieve reasonabe coverage
of the subject of Foundation Engineering as defined by the text scope given in Chapter 1.
The subject matter ranges in computational difficulty from requiring use of advanced pro-
grammable calculators through digital computers. This range of material allows the book to
be used in Civil, Structural, Architectural, and Construction Engineering curricula through a
judicious selection of topics and for a minimum of two courses.
This edition—although almost completely rewritten—retains most of the organization of
the fourth edition since that edition was also substantially rewritten. This edition has focused
more on cleaning up and clarifying those topics requested by users or deemed necessary by
the author.
A principal difference between this and the fourth edition is to provide the computer
programs from that edition on a diskette in compiled format. All of the programs were edited
to allow the user to input data from screen requests. Where the data file is extensive, the user
has the option of creating the data file and saving it to disk for later revision using a screen
editor so that parametric studies can be easily made. Other than adding the screen routines,
the programs are essentially those of the fourth edition. The reason for this is a number of
instructors obtained copies of those programs in source code from the author (others had
their students type in the programs) so it would be counterproductive to revise the programs
substantially so that program users do not get quite the same output order using fifth edition
programs compared with those from the fourth edition. Also, when those users obtained the
programs in source code, a user's manual was provided giving the input variable names, order
of input, and units.
As in previous editions a very substantial number of examples are included. The exam-
ples carried over have been extensively reworked and/or new ones added with a reasonably
detailed explanation of steps in arriving at the solution. As in previous editions I have at-
tempted to include examples that are realistic—at least within limits of available text space.
Often they have been cited from published works so the instructor can require the student to
do some background research to gain an appreciation of the difficulty associated with trying
to use the published work of others from professional journals. Where the example is hand-
worked, comments and discussion of the results and what the next step in the design process
might be are usually given. Where computer output is used, some comments are always given
on how to make output checks to see if a correct solution has been obtained for that model.
This practice supplements the prior text discussion about the computer program.
I wish to express appreciation to the many users of this text, both in the United States and
abroad, who have written or called with comments or constructive criticism or simply to make
inquiry about a procedure. I should also like to thank those who took part in the McGraw-
Hill user survey to provide input for this revision including Y. S. Chae, Rutgers University—
Busch Campus; K. L. Bergesen, Iowa State University; M. Gunaratne, University of Southern
Florida; C. W. Lovell, Purdue University; Mete Oner, Oklahoma State University; and Stein
Sture, University of Colorado.
Finally I have to acknowledge the very considerable contribution of my wife, Faye, who
helped with figure and reference checking and the myriad other busy work details necessary
to produce the manuscript.

ABOUT THE COMPUTER PROGRAMS

Software to accompany this text is available separately.
To obtain, please contact McGraw-Hill office nearest you or your local bookstore.

When ordering the diskette, please quote PART NO. 0-07-114811-D.

The 16 computer programs on the diskette infname.EXE format will execute either with
or without a math coprocessor on your system. These programs will execute on any IBM
or compatible system that uses PC-DOS or MS-DOS for the operating system. They will
operate in Windows™ environment but as "DOS" programs. A computer system with a
hard disk is recommended but not required. There is an installation program on the
diskette to assist you in putting the programs onto your system.
The 16 programs are in Subdirectory EXE as follows:

There are 50 data sets included with the programs in subdirectory DATA. The data sets
are keyed to the program output in the text. Note that if these programs accept a disk file as
input, they output the file name with the output for a project record.
There is additional user's information about some of the above programs and a summary
of other programs noted in the text (programs B-12 through B-31 and several others that are
available from the author) in the disk file README.DOC, which you should read and print
out. Note that "new" indicates new programs—others with B-numbers are essentially the
same as listed in the fourth edition of this textbook.
There is some information on input data organization, parameter identifications, and
limitations in the disk file USERMANL.DOC, which you should also print. Consider putting
these two printouts in a file folder for rapid reference.

1-1 FOUNDATIONS: THEIR IMPORTANCE AND PURPOSE
All engineered construction resting on the earth must be carried by some kind of interfac-
ing element called a foundation.1 The foundation is the part of an engineered system that
transmits to, and into, the underlying soil or rock the loads supported by the foundation and
its self-weight. The resulting soil stresses—except at the ground surface—are in addition to
those presently existing in the earth mass from its self-weight and geological history.
The term superstructure is commonly used to describe the engineered part of the system
bringing load to the foundation, or substructure. The term superstructure has particular sig-
nificance for buildings and bridges; however, foundations also may carry only machinery,
support industrial equipment (pipes, towers, tanks), act as sign bases, and the like. For these
reasons it is better to describe a foundation as that part of the engineered system that interfaces
the load-carrying components to the ground.
It is evident on the basis of this definition that a foundation is the most important part of
the engineering system.

1-2 FOUNDATION ENGINEERING
The title foundation engineer is given to that person who by reason of training and experience
is sufficiently versed in scientific principles and engineering judgment (often termed "art")
to design a foundation. We might say engineering judgment is the creative part of this design
process.
The necessary scientific principles are acquired through formal educational courses in
geotechnical (soil mechanics, geology, foundation engineering) and structural (analysis, de-

1TMs is also sometimes called the substructure.

CHAPTER
i
INTRODUCTION


sign in reinforced concrete and steel, etc.) engineering and continued self-study via short
courses, professional conferences, journal reading, and the like.
Because of the heterogeneous nature of soil and rock masses, two foundations—even on
adjacent construction sites—will seldom be the same except by coincidence. Since every
foundation represents at least partly a venture into the unknown, it is of great value to have
access to others' solutions obtained from conference presentations, journal papers, and text-
book condensations of appropriate literature. The amalgamation of experience, study of what
others have done in somewhat similar situations, and the site-specific geotechnical infor-
mation to produce an economical, practical, and safe substructure design is application of
engineering judgment.
The following steps are the minimum required for designing a foundation:

1. Locate the site and the position of load. A rough estimate of the foundation load(s) is
usually provided by the client or made in-house. Depending on the site or load system
complexity, a literature survey may be started to see how others have approached similar
problems.
2. Physically inspect the site for any geological or other evidence that may indicate a potential
design problem that will have to be taken into account when making the design or giving
a design recommendation. Supplement this inspection with any previously obtained soil
data.
3. Establish the field exploration program and, on the basis of discovery (or what is found in
the initial phase), set up the necessary supplemental field testing and any laboratory test
program.
4. Determine the necessary soil design parameters based on integration of test data, scientific
principles, and engineering judgment. Simple or complex computer analyses may be in-
volved. For complex problems, compare the recommended data with published literature
or engage another geotechnical consultant to give an outside perspective to the results.
5. Design the foundation using the soil parameters from step 4. The foundation should be
economical and be able to be built by the available construction personnel. Take into ac-
count practical construction tolerances and local construction practices. Interact closely
with all concerned (client, engineers, architect, contractor) so that the substructure system
is not excessively overdesigned and risk is kept within acceptable levels. A computer may
be used extensively (or not at all) in this step.

The foundation engineer should be experienced in and have participation in all five of the
preceding steps. In practice this often is not the case. An independent geotechnical firm spe-
cializing in soil exploration, soil testing, design of landfills, embankments, water pollution
control, etc. often assigns one of its geotechnical engineers to do steps 1 through 4. The output
of step 4 is given to the client—often a foundation engineer who specializes in the design of
the structural elements making up the substructure system. The principal deficiency in this
approach is the tendency to treat the design soil parameters—obtained from soil tests of vari-
able quality, heavily supplemented with engineering judgment—as precise numbers whose
magnitude is totally inviolable. Thus, the foundation engineer and geotechnical consultant
must work closely together, or at least have frequent conferences as the design progresses. It
should be evident that both parties need to appreciate the problems of each other and, par-
ticularly, that the foundation design engineer must be aware of the approximate methods used


to obtain the soil parameters being used. This understanding can be obtained by each having
training in the other's specialty.
To this end, the primary focus of this text will be on analysis and design of the interfacing
elements for buildings, machines, and retaining structures and on those soil mechanics princi-
ples used to obtain the necessary soil parameters required to accomplish the design. Specific
foundation elements to be considered include shallow elements such as footings and mats and
deep elements such as piles and drilled piers. Retaining structures will also be considered in
later chapters.
Geotechnical considerations will primarily be on strength and deformation and those soil-
water phenomena that affect strength and deformation. With the current trend to using sites
with marginal soil parameters for major projects, methods to improve the strength and de-
formation characteristics through soil improvement methods will be briefly considered in
Chap. 6.

1-3 FOUNDATIONS: CLASSIFICATIONS
AND SELECT DEFINITIONS
Foundations may be classified based on where the load is carried by the ground, producing:

Shallow foundations—termed bases, footings, spread footings, or mats. The depth is gen-
erally D/B < 1 but may be somewhat more. Refer to Fig. 1-la.
Deep foundations—piles, drilled piers, or drilled caissons. Lp/B > 4+ with a pile illus-
trated in Fig. l-\b.
Figure 1-1 illustrates general cases of the three basic foundation types considered in this
text and provides some definitions commonly used in this type of work. Because all the defi-
nitions and symbols shown will be used throughout the text, the reader should give this figure
careful study.
The superstructure brings loads to the soil interface using column-type members. The load-
carrying columns are usually of steel or concrete with allowable design compressive stresses
on the order of 14O+ MPa (steel) to 1O+ MPa (concrete) and therefore are of relatively small
cross-sectional area. The supporting capacity of the soil, from either strength or deformation
considerations, is seldom over 1000 kPa but more often on the order of 200 to 250 kPa. This
means the foundation is interfacing two materials with a strength ratio on the order of several
hundred. As a consequence the loads must be "spread" to the soil in a manner such that its
limiting strength is not exceeded and resulting deformations are tolerable. Shallow founda-
tions accomplish this by spreading the loads laterally, hence the term spread footing. Where
a spread footing (or simply footing) supports a single column, a mat is a special footing used
to support several randomly spaced columns or to support several rows of parallel columns
and may underlie a portion of or the entire building. The mat may also be supported, in turn,
by piles or drilled piers. Foundations supporting machinery and such are sometimes termed
bases. Machinery and the like can produce a substantial load intensity over a small area, so
the base is used as a load-spreading device similar to the footing.
Deep foundations are analogous to spread footings but distribute the load vertically rather
than horizontally. A qualitative load distribution over depth for a pile is shown in Fig. 1-1 b.
The terms drilled pier and drilled caisson are for the pile type member that is constructed by
drilling a 0.76+-m diameter hole in the soil, adding reinforcing as necessary, and backfilling

more detail in Chaps. 16-19.
A major consideration for both spread footings (and mats) and piles is the distribution
of stresses in the stress influence zone beneath the foundation [footing or pile tip (or point)].
The theoretical distribution of vertical stress beneath a square footing on the ground surface is
shown in Fig. IAa. It is evident that below a critical depth of about 5B the soil has a negligible
increase in stress (about 0.02qo) from the footing load. This influence depth depends on B,
however. For example, if B = 0.3 m, the critical stress zone is 5 X 0.3 = 1.5 m, and if B =
3 m, the zone is 15 m for a zonal influence depth ratio of 1 : 10. Because these B values are
in a possible range beneath a large building, any poor soils below a depth of 2 m would have
a considerable influence on the design of the wider footings.
Any structure used to retain soil or other material (see Fig. 1-lc) in a geometric shape
other than that naturally occurring under the influence of gravity is a retaining structure. Re-
taining structures may be constructed of a large number of materials including geotextiles,
wood and metal sheeting, plain or reinforced concrete, reinforced earth, precast concrete el-
ements, closely spaced pilings, interlocking wood or metal elements (crib walls), and so on.
Sometimes the retaining structure is permanent and in other cases it is removed when it is no
longer needed.
The foundations selected for study in this text are so numerous that their specialized study
is appropriate. Every building in existence rests on a foundation whether formally designed or
not. Every basement wall in any building is a retaining structure, whether formally designed
or not. Major buildings in areas underlain with thick cohesive soil deposits nearly always use
piles or drilled caissons to carry the loads vertically to more competent strata, primarily to
control settlement. Note that nearly every major city is underlain by clay or has zones where
clay is present and requires piles or caissons. Numerous bridges have retaining structures
at the abutments and spread foundations carrying the intermediate spans. Usually the abut-
ment end reactions are carried into the ground by piles. Harbor and offshore structures (used
primarily for oil production) use piles extensively and for both vertical and lateral loads.

1-3.1 Other Foundations
Many other types of "foundations" that the geotechnical/foundation engineer may encounter
are not readily classified. These may include reinforcing the foundation of an existing build-
ing if it has undergone excessive settlement or so it can carry additional load if additional
height is added. They may involve removing an existing foundation (whole or in part) and
replacing it with a basement or other structure, i.e., putting the new foundation at a lower
depth. They may involve routing a tunnel (subway or utility) beneath an existing structure
or for some type of vibration control. In some of these cases no new foundation is designed.
Rather, the engineer must determine the magnitude of any potential adverse effect on the ex-
isting structure. If the adverse effect is intolerable, the engineer may need to devise a remedial
design.
These several types of "foundations" are so diverse—and are so often one of a kind—that
their study is not suitable for a general foundation engineering textbook. These types of design
require a geotechnical engineer with a solid base in geotechnical fundamentals (generally
with an advanced degree), some experience, a willingness to venture into the unknown, and
a willingness to draw on the experience of others through membership in the appropriate
technical societies.


1-4 FOUNDATIONS: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
Foundation elements must be proportioned both to interface with the soil at a safe stress level
and to limit settlements to an acceptable amount. In the past 5O+ years few buildings (but
numerous embankment types) have failed as a result of overstressing the underlying soil.
However, excessive settlement problems are fairly common and somewhat concealed since
only the most spectacular ones get published.
Few modern buildings collapse from excessive settlements; however, it is not uncommon
for a partial collapse or a localized failure in a structural member to occur. More common
occurrences are unsightly wall and floor cracks, uneven floors (sags and slopes), sticking
doors and windows, and the like.
The variability of soil in combination with unanticipated loads or subsequent soil move-
ments (e.g., earthquakes) can result in settlement problems over which the designer may have
little control. In other words, current state-of-the-art design methods may greatly reduce the
likelihood (risk factor) of settlement problems but do not generally provide a risk-free project.
In fairness, though, some problems are the direct result of poor design—either simple care-
lessness or lack of engineering ability. Yes, just as there are both competent and incompetent
doctors, lawyers, and other professionals, so there are competent and incompetent engineers!
A major factor that greatly complicates foundation design is that the soil parameters used
for the design are obtained before the project is started. Later when the foundation is in place,
it is on (or in) soil with properties that may be considerably modified from the original, ei-
ther from the construction process or from installing the foundation. That is, the soil may be
excavated and/or replaced and compacted; excavations tend to remove load and allow the un-
derlying soil to expand; driving piles usually makes soil more dense, etc. Any of these events
either directly alters the soil (replacement) or modifies the initially estimated soil strength
parameters.
As a result of the uncertainties in loads, in soil properties, and in attempts to account for
variability and any other factors, it is common practice to be conservative in designing this
part of the system. We may quickly note, however, that this being the most important part
but the most difficult to access if problems later develop, a conservative design or even an
overdesign has a better return on investment here than in other parts of the project.
Another factor that encourages conservative design is the fact that many geotechnical en-
gineers tend to imply that their talents (and design recommendations) are better than those of
the competition. This generates a false sense on the part of the client that using that geotech-
nical engineer will produce a minimum cost foundation. When this happens and problems
later occur (unanticipated soil strata, water, excessive settlements, or whatever), the client is
very likely to litigate (i.e., sue). This possibility means that geotechnical engineers should be
candid about the status of the state of the art in this specialty and make the client fully aware
that precise soil parameters are difficult if not impossible to quantify and that at least some
design conservatism is prudent.
Design conservatism means that any two design firms are unlikely to come up with exactly
the same soil parameters and final foundation design. It would not be unusual for one firm
to recommend the base contact pressure qo of Fig. 1-la to be, say, 200 kPa whereas another
might recommend 225 or even 250 kPa—both with the use of spread footings. There might be
a problem in ethics, however, if one firm recommended 200 kPa and the other recommended
only 100 kPa, which would require a mat foundation or the use of piles. One of the recom-
mendations is either overly optimistic (the 200 kPa) or realistic; the other is either realistic or


overly conservative. Being excessively conservative is an ethics problem, unless the client is
made aware of the several alternatives and accepts the more conservative recommendation
as being in his or her best interests.
In summary, a proper design requires the following:

1. Determining the building purpose, probable service-life loading, type of framing, soil pro-
file, construction methods, and construction costs
2. Determining the client/owner's needs
3. Making the design, but ensuring that it does not excessively degrade the environment, and
provides a margin of safety that produces a tolerable risk level to all parties: the public,
the owner, and the engineer

1-5 FOUNDATIONS: ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
The previous section outlined in general terms requirements to be met in designing a foun-
dation in terms of settlement and soil strength. We will now outline a number of additional
considerations that may have to be taken into account at specific sites.

1. Depth must be adequate to avoid lateral squeezing of material from beneath the foundation
for footings and mats. Similarly, excavation for the foundation must take into account that
this can happen to existing building footings on adjacent sites and requires that suitable
precautions be taken. The number of settlement cracks that are found by owners of existing
buildings when excavations for adjacent structures begin is truly amazing.
2. Depth of foundation must be below the zone of seasonal volume changes caused by freez-
ing, thawing, and plant growth. Most local building codes will contain minimum depth
requirements.
3. The foundation scheme may have to consider expansive soil conditions. Here the building
tends to capture upward-migrating soil water vapor, which condenses and saturates the
soil in the interior zone, even as normal perimeter evaporation takes place. The soil in a
distressingly large number of geographic areas tends to swell in the presence of substantial
moisture and carry the foundation up with it.
4. In addition to compressive strength considerations, the foundation system must be safe
against overturning, sliding, and any uplift (flotation).
5. System must be protected against corrosion or deterioration due to harmful materials
present in the soil. Safety is a particular concern in reclaiming sanitary landfills but has
application for marine and other situations where chemical agents that are present can
corrode metal pilings, destroy wood sheeting/piling, cause adverse reactions with Port-
land cement in concrete footings or piles, and so forth.
6. Foundation system should be adequate to sustain some later changes in site or construction
geometry and be easily modified should changes in the superstructure and loading become
necessary.
7. The foundation should be buildable with available construction personnel. For one-of-a-
kind projects there may be no previous experience. In this case, it is necessary that all
concerned parties carefully work together to achieve the desired result.

Retaining structures

Retaining walls, Permanent material Any type of soil but a specified
bridge abutments retention zone (Chaps. 11, 12) in backfill is
usually of controlled fill.
Sheeting structures Temporary or permanent Retain any soil or water. Back-
(sheet pile, wood for excavations, marine fill for waterfront and cofferdam
sheeting, etc.) cofferdams for river work systems is usually granular for
greater drainage.


8. The foundation and site development must meet local environmental standards, includ-
ing determining if the building is or has the potential for being contaminated with haz-
ardous materials from ground contact (for example, radon or methane gas). Adequate air
circulation and ventilation within the building are the responsibility of the mechanical
engineering group of the design team.

Although not all of the preceding are applicable to a given project, it is readily apparent
that those that are tend to introduce much additional uncertainty into the system. This makes
the application of engineering judgment an even more important ingredient in the design
process.

1-6 FOUNDATIONS: SELECTION OF TYPE
Table 1-1 tabulates the use and application of the several general foundation types shown
in Fig. 1-1. Design of these several types will be taken up in detail in later chapters, but it
is useful at this point to obtain a general overview of when and where a particular type of
foundation is used.
Where the groundwater table (GWT) is present (see Fig. l-la), it is common to lower it
below the construction zone either permanently or for the duration of the construction work.
The GWT shown on Fig. l-la is below the footing and would probably be below the con-
struction zone. If the GWT later rises above the footing level, the footing will be subject to
uplift or flotation, which would have to be taken into account.
If the groundwater table must be lowered either temporarily or permanently, it is usually
necessary to get approval from environmental protection agencies. Also there is a potential
problem of causing ground subsidence in the area surrounding the construction site if there
is significant lowering of the GWT. For this reason it is a common practice to construct water
barriers around the site perimeter and only pump out the interior.

1-7 THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS (SI)
AND THE FOOT-POUND-SECOND (Fps) SYSTEM2
We may define a system of units for computational purposes in terms of the fundamental
quantities of length, mass, and time as follows:

a. Meter, kilogram, second = mks; SI
b. Foot, pound, second = Fps; widely used in the United States through 1993-1995 but
almost nowhere else since about 1975.

Table 1-2 lists computational units (see also table inside back cover) and the abbreviations
that will be consistently used throughout the text. Refer to this table if you are not already
familiar with the abbreviation when later used. Units in this table generally follow those used

2 This section has been retained for "historical" purposes and for those few users who may need some aid in making
units conversions.


by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Committee D-18 (soils and soil
testing), of which the author is a member.
The value of the gravitational constant g shown in the table is at approximately 45° latitude
and sea level. It varies about 0.5 percent based on latitude and elevation, but its use as a
constant will produce a negligible error for foundation work in most geographic locations on
the Earth.
In the general case the force is computed as
Mass X acceleration m • a
Constant of proportionality r/ r/

*Fps units primarily for historical purposes.


For the system units of primary interest, a number of sources (including most college
physics textbooks) give the following:

System Mass Length Time Force F 17
Sl(mks) kg m s N 1 kg • m/N • s2
US(Fps) slug ft s lbf 1 slug • ft/lb • s2
US(Fps) lbm ft s 1 lbf 32.2 lbm • ft/lb • s2
Metric kg m s kgf 9.807 kg • m/kgf • s2
With this table, let us look at a 1 ft3 volume of sand that weighs and has a mass of 100
pounds (lbf and\bm obtained from F = m-a/iq = 100 X 32.2/32.2) as determined by placing
it on a set of laboratory scales. Using this 100 lbm, we have (using table in book cover) the
following:
Mass in kilograms = 100 lbm X 0.4536 kg/lbm = 45.36 kg
Volume in cubic meters = 1 ft3 X (0.3048 m/ft)3 = 0.02832 m3
If this sand is placed in a weightless bag and suspended by a spring in the laboratory, what
is the spring force? The vertical acceleration is, of course, g, and
SI: F = m(g)/r] = 45.36 kg(9.807 m/s2)/l kg • m/N • s2 - 444.8 N
Fps: F = 100(32.2)/32.2 = 100 lbf (usually written as 100 Ib)
It is this latter computation that causes confusion—obtaining 100 Ib of force from a 100
Ib mass. Closer inspection, however, shows this conclusion is valid only because g = 17. In
those cases where this equality does not exist, we have lbm ^ lbf. Let us also look at the
weight/volume and density relationships for this case:
Unit weight y = weightforce/volume
SI: 7 = 444.8 N/0.028 32 m3 = 15 706.2 N/m3 = 15.71 kN/m3
Fps: 7 = 100 lbf/1 ft3 - 100 lbf/ft3 (or pcf) = 0.100 kef
Density p = mass/volume
SI p = 45.36 kg/0.028 32 m3 = 1601.7 kg/m3 = 1.602 tonnes/m3
= 1.602 Mg/m3 = 1.602 g/cm3
An alternative computation in SI with application in soil dynamics computations is to
define density as
kN/m3 1.602 X 9.807 _ ,A_ _ __ 2 / 4
SI: p= — = — ^ 8 0 7 = 1M1 k N s / m
Fps: p = 100/1 ft3 = 100 pcf = 0.100 kef
Also since the unit weight of water yw = 62.4 pcf = 9.807 kN/m3, we can compute the
unit weights between systems as


These unit weight relationships are particularly useful in converting between SI and Fps.
Also note the connection between the unit weight of soil/unit weight of water, giving directly
the soil density p as
y 15.71 100 * *M , 2
P = ^ = 9^O7 = 614 = L 6 O 2 8 / C m
- 1601.7 kg/m3
= 1.602 kN s2/m4
The first two forms for mass density just given are not dimensionally correct and require
conversion factors, which are not shown since they cancel. The last form, in units of kN-s2/m4,
is dimensionally correct as given.
Some commonly used approximations are obtained from the table on the inside back cover
as follows:

Base Value Suggest using
1 ksf - 47.88 kPa 50 kPa
2 ksf = 1 ton/ft2 = 95.76 kPa 100 kPa
1 kg/cm2 = 0.976 ton/ft2 1 ton/ft2 or 1 tsf

The last value of 1 kg/cm2 — 1 tsf is the origin of the one-time common use of tons and
tsf by many engineers for pile loads and soil pressure. With SI being used, the ton3 and tsf
units are obsolete.

1-8 COMPUTATIONAL ACCURACY
VERSUS DESIGN PRECISION
Pocket or desktop calculators and digital computers compute with 7 to 14 digits of accuracy.
This gives a fictitiously high precision to computed quantities whose input values may have a
design precision only within 10 to 30 percent of the numerical value used. The reader should
be aware of this actual versus computed precision when checking the example data and out-
put. The author has attempted to maintain a checkable precision by writing the intermediate
value (when a pocket calculator was used) to the precision the user should input to check
the succeeding steps. If this intermediate value is not used, the computed answer can easily
differ in the 1.0 to 0.1 position. The reader should also be aware that typesetting, transcribing,
and typing errors inevitably occur, particularly in misplaced parentheses and misreading 3
for 8, etc.

3This is the 2000 Ib ton. The "metric" ton of 1000 kg is still used to some extent but is usually identified as "tonne."


The text user should be able to reproduce most of the digits in the example problems to
0.1 or less unless a typesetting (or other) error has inadvertently occurred. There may be
larger discrepancies if the reader uses interpolated data and the author used "exact" data
from a computer printout without interpolating. Generally this situation will be noted so that
the reader is alerted to potential computational discrepancies. The example problems have
been included primarily for procedure rather than numerical accuracy, and the user should
be aware of this underlying philosophy when studying them.

1-9 COMPUTER PROGRAMS IN FOUNDATION
ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
A large number of foundation engineering problems can be efficiently analyzed and/or de-
signed using a digital computer. Particular advantages of using a computer accrue from these
features:

1. One is able to try a range of problem variables to obtain a feel for the effect of specifying,
or using, a particular set of soil parameters.
2. One can avoid having to use tabulated data or plotted curves, which usually require inter-
polation and excessive simplification of the foundation model.
3. One can minimize computational errors from these sources:
a. Erroneous key entry when using a calculator. The bad entry is (or should be) output to
paper using a computer so the input can be checked.
b. Omission of computational steps. A working computer program usually includes all the
design steps. A set of hand computations may not include every step for any number
of reasons (forget, not be aware of, carelessness, etc.).
c. Calculator chip malfunction not readily detected except by using two calculators. Com-
puter chips are often internally checked on power-up, or output is so bad that chip errors
are visually detected.
4. With output to a printer one has a paper record of the problem for office files without the
necessity of transcribing data from intermediate steps. This avoids copy errors such as 83
for 38 and the like.

The major disadvantage of using a computer program is that it is difficult to write a first
generation, error-free program of real use in a design office. Program usability tends to in-
crease with each revision (or history) level.
With the current wide availability of computer programs—many, such as those on the
included diskette, having a "history"—the advantages gained from program use far exceed
any perceived disadvantages. The author suggests that both geotechnical and foundation en-
gineers should use computer programs whenever possible—and certainly be aware of what
computer program(s) each is likely to use for the given project.
This statement is made with full awareness of the possibility of program errors (or "bugs").
Fortunately, most geotechnical software is task-specific so that the possibility of program
errors or their not being detected is not so likely as for some of the large finite-element
or structural analysis programs that purport to solve a wide range of tasks. In any case, the


author cannot recall a single reported foundation design failure that can be attributed to a
bad4 computer program.
It should be evident that computer programs vary widely in perceived quality, perceived
quality being defined here as problem limitations and "ease of use." Both users and program-
mers should be aware that it is difficult to predefine the full range of problem parameters
likely to be encountered in practice, so nearly any geotechnical program of significant value
is likely to have some built-in limitations. Ease of use is highly subjective and depends more
on user familiarity with a program than how easy it really is to use—many users like pull-
down menus and graphics whereas others are quite content without these features. As a final
comment on computer programs, be aware that although business applications and games
usually have a market in the hundreds of thousands, geotechnical programs have a potential
market of only a few thousand. This small market means geotechnical software is likely to
be more expensive than other software and, to minimize development costs, it is not likely to
have many so-called user-friendly features.
One should routinely check the output from any computer program used for design or
analysis. The user is responsible for his or her design since it is impossible to write a computer
program with any usefulness that cannot be misused in some manner. Primarily for this reason
most computer programs are sold or licensed with a disclaimer making the user responsible.
Fortunately, most computer programs can be written to be somewhat self-checking, either
by writing back the input data or by providing output that can be readily identified as correct
(or incorrect) if the user understands or knows how to use the program. It should go without
saying that, if you do not know much about the specific problem being designed or analyzed,
you should first do some preliminary study before using a computer program on it.
This textbook encourages computer use in foundation engineering. Select programs are
furnished on the enclosed computer diskette in compiled format to save time for the text user.
All of the programs used or suggested for use are identified from the author's program library
and are available in source code with user's manuals individually or in a package on IBM
PC/AT type diskettes (5^-in. or 3.5-in.) at a reasonable5 cost from the author.

4 Generally if the program is "bad," the user finds this out by performing some kind of independent check and does
not use that program further in the design.
5 Please note that "reasonable" does not mean "free." There is a substantial cost just in reproducing a diskette,
providing a user's manual, and shipping.


2-1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter reviews those physical and engineering properties of soils of principal interest
for the analysis and design of foundation elements considered in this text. These primarily
include the following:
1. Strength parameters1
Stress-strain modulus (or modulus of elasticity), Es\ shear modulus, G', and Poisson's
ratio, /x; angle of internal friction, (/>; soil cohesion, c
2. Compressibility indexes for amount and rate of settlement
Compression: index, Cc, and ratio, C'c; recompression: index, Cr, and ratio, C,!!; coefficient
of consolidation, cv\ coefficient of secondary compression, Ca
3. Gravimetric-volumetric data
Unit weight, y; specific gravity, Gs\ void ratio, e, or porosity, n\ water content, w/ (where
/ = Af for natural, L for liquid limit, or P for plastic limit; e.g., Wp = plastic limit)

Symbols and definitions generally follow those of ASTM D 653 except E5, G', and /JL (refer also to "List of primary
symbols" following the Preface). It is common to subscript E for soil as E5, for concrete Ec, etc. G' will be used for
shear modulus, as Gs is generally used for specific gravity. The symbol fi is commonly used for Poisson's ratio;
however, ASTM D 653 suggests v, which is difficult to write by hand.

k = coefficient of permeability (or hydraulic conductivity)

The symbols shown here will be consistently used throughout the text and will not be
subsequently identified/defined.
The more common laboratory tests also will be briefly commented on. For all laboratory
tests we can immediately identify several problems:

1. Recovery of good quality samples. It is not possible to recover samples with zero distur-
bance, but if the disturbance is a minimum—a relative term—the sample quality may be
adequate for the project.
2. Necessity of extrapolating the results from the laboratory tests on a few small samples,
which may involve a volume of ±0.03 m3, to the site, which involves several thousands
of cubic meters.
3. Laboratory equipment limitations. The triaxial compression text is considered one of the
better test procedures available. It is easy to obtain a sample, put it into the cell, apply
some cell pressure, and load the sample to failure in compression. The problem is that
the cell pressure, as usually used, applies an even, all around (isotropic) compression. In
situ the confining pressure prior to the foundation load application is usually anisotropic
(vertical pressure is different from the lateral value). It is not very easy to apply anisotropic
confining pressure to soil samples in a triaxial cell—even if we know what to use for
vertical and lateral values.
4. Ability and motivation of the laboratory personnel.

The effect of these several items is to produce test results that may not be much refined
over values estimated from experience. Items 1 through 3 make field testing a particularly
attractive alternative. Field tests will be considered in the next chapter since they tend to be
closely associated with the site exploration program.
Index settlement and strength correlations are alternatives that have value in preliminary
design studies on project feasibility. Because of both test limitations and costs, it is useful
to have relationships between easily determined index properties such as the liquid limit
and plasticity index and the design parameters. Several of the more common correlations are
presented later in this chapter. Correlations are usually based on a collection of data from
an extensive literature survey and used to plot a best-fit curve or to perform a numerical
regression analysis.

2-2 FOUNDATIONSUBSOILS
We are concerned with placing the foundation on either soil or rock. This material may be
under water as for certain bridge and marine structures, but more commonly we will place
the foundation on soil or rock near the ground surface.
Soil is an aggregation of particles that may range very widely in size. It is the by-product
of mechanical and chemical weathering of rock. Some of these particles are given specific
names according to their sizes, such as gravel, sand, silt, clay, etc., and are more completely
described in Sec. 2-7.


Soil, being a mass of irregular-shaped particles of varying sizes, will consist of the particles
(or solids), voids (pores or spaces) between particles, water in some of the voids, and air taking
up the remaining void space. At temperatures below freezing the pore water may freeze, with
resulting particle separation (volume increase). When the ice melts particles close up (volume
decrease). If the ice is permanent, the ice-soil mixture is termed permafrost It is evident that
the pore water is a variable state quantity that may be in the form of water vapor, water, or ice;
the amount depends on climatic conditions, recency of rainfall, or soil location with respect
to the GWT of Fig. 1-1.
Soil may be described as residual or transported. Residual soil is formed from weathering
of parent rock at the present location. It usually contains angular rock fragments of varying
sizes in the soil-rock interface zone. Transported soils are those formed from rock weathered
at one location and transported by wind, water, ice, or gravity to the present site. The terms
residual and transported must be taken in the proper context, for many current residual soils
are formed (or are being formed) from transported soil deposits of earlier geological peri-
ods, which indurated into rocks. Later uplifts have exposed these rocks to a new onset of
weathering. Exposed limestone, sandstone, and shale are typical of indurated transported soil
deposits of earlier geological eras that have been uplifted to undergo current weathering and
decomposition back to soil to repeat the geological cycle.
Residual soils are usually preferred to support foundations as they tend to have better en-
gineering properties. Soils that have been transported—particularly by wind or water—are
often of poor quality. These are typified by small grain size, large amounts of pore space,
potential for the presence of large amounts of pore water, and they often are highly com-
pressible. Note, however, exceptions that produce poor-quality residual soils and good-quality
transported soil deposits commonly exist. In general, each site must be examined on its own
merits.

2-3 SOIL VOLUME AND DENSITY RELATIONSHIPS
The more common soil definitions and gravimetric-volumetric relationships are presented in
this section. Figure 2-1 illustrates and defines a number of terms used in these relationships.
Void ratio e. The ratio of the volume of voids Vv to the volume of soils Vs in a given volume
of material, usually expressed as a decimal.
e = Y^ 0 < e « : o o (2-1)
*s
For soils, e ranges from about 0.35 in the most dense state to seldom over 2 in the loosest
state.
Porosity n. The ratio of the volume of voids to the total volume Vu expressed as either a
decimal or a percentage.
. - £ (2-2)
Water content w. The ratio of the weight of water Ww to the weight of soil solids W5,
expressed as a percentage but usually used in decimal form.

(2-3)


Figure 2-1 Block diagrams showing: (a) Weight/volume relationships for a soil mass; (b) volume/void relation-
ships; (c) volumes expressed in terms of weights and specific gravity.

Unit density (or mass) p. The ratio of mass per unit of volume. In the Fps system the values
are the same as unit weight following. The SI system gives units of kg/m3 but a preferred
usage unit is g/cm3. Note that 1 g/cm3 = 1 Mg/m3 = 1 tonne/m3. Often unit density is called
"density."
Unit weight y. The weight of a unit volume of soil (or other material) in force units. The
general expression is

r - ^ (2-4)
Commonly used units are kN/m3 or pcf, kef. The symbol may be subscripted to identify
particular state values as ydry = Ws/Vt, etc. The unit weight can vary from a minimum at
the dry state to a maximum at the saturated (voids full of water) state for a given particle
arrangement.
Degree of saturation S. The ratio of the volume of water to the total volume of soil voids,
expressed as a percentage but used as a decimal.

S = Y^L x 100 (%) (2-5)

A "saturated" soil as obtained from beneath the groundwater table may have a computed S
of between 95 and 100 percent.
Specific gravity G. The usual definition for soil is the same as found in most elementary
physics textbooks. The unit weight of distilled water is standard at 4°C, but the usual labo-
ratory temperatures in the range of 15 to 25°C do not introduce serious errors. G is usually
subscripted to identify the quantity; for soil grains, obtain Gs as

Gs = ^ = 2L ( 2 .6)
The unit weight of water may be taken as 9.807 kN/m3, 62.4 pcf, or more commonly as 1
g/cm3 so that the factor yw drops out of the calculations—as long as ys is also in units of
g/cm3.

These six basic definitions in equation form are sufficient to develop any needed relationships
for geotechnical engineering problems. For example, a useful relationship between void ratio
e and porosity n can be obtained from the block diagram of Fig. 2-\b as follows:

(a) (b) (C)

Water

Air

Soil


Let the volume of solids Vs = 1.00 (since values are symbolic anyway). This relation
gives directly that e = Vv from Eq. (2-1). Placing these values on the left side of the block
diagram (as shown) gives the total volume directly as Vt = 1 + e. Now using Eq. (2-2), we
have

and, solving Eq. (2-7) for e, we obtain

* = ^ - (2-8)
1 - n
A useful expression for dry unit weight can be obtained similarly by making reference to the
block diagram of Fig. 2-Ia (right side). By inspection we have Wt = Ws + Ww (the air has
negligible weight). From Eq. (2-3) we have Ww = wWs (where w is in decimal form). Also,
dividing Ws and Wt by Vt gives the dry and wet unit weights so
Tdry + Wydry = 7 wet
which gives

7 d i y " 1 + w ( 2 9 )
A useful relation for the void ratio in terms of S, w, and G5 is obtained by using yw = 1 g/cm3
as follows:

1. From Eq. (2-6) and referring to the block diagram of Fig. 2-Ic, obtain

and because Gw = yw = 1, the weight of water Ww (in grams) = VwyWGW = Vw (in
cubic centimeters, cm3).
2. Let V, = 1.0 cm3, and from Eq. (2-1) obtain Vv = eVs = e.
3. From Eq. (2-5) and using S as a decimal, obtain directly
vw = svv
Substitution of Ww for Vw from step 1 and Vv from step 2 gives
Ww = Se
4. From Eq. (2-6) obtain the weight of soil solids as
Ws = VsywGs.
which for V5 = I cm3 gives Ws = Gs.
5. From Eq. (2-3) for water content and using above step 3 for Ww and step 4 for Ws, obtain


6. Solving step 5 for the void ratio e, we obtain

e = ^Gs (2-10)

and when 5 = 1 (a saturated soil), we have e = wGs.

The dry unit is often of particular interest. Let us obtain a relationship for it in terms of water
content and specific gravity of the soil solids Gs. From Fig. 2-Ic the volume of a given mass
Vt = 1 + e, and with e obtained from Eq. (2-10) we have

Also, in any system of units the weight of the soil solids is

These derivations have been presented to illustrate the use of the basic definitions, together
with a basic block diagram on which is placed known (or assumed) values. It is recommended
that a derivation of the needed relationship is preferable to making a literature search to find
an equation that can be used.

Example 2-1. A cohesive soil specimen (from a split spoon; see Chap. 3 for method) was subjected
to laboratory tests to obtain the following data: The moisture content w = 22.5 percent; G5 = 2.60.
To determine the approximate unit weight, a sample weighing 224.0 g was placed in a 500-cm3

2-4 MAJOR FACTORS THAT AFFECT
THE ENGINEERING PROPERTIES OF SOILS
Most factors that affect the engineering properties of soils involve geological processes acting
over long time periods. Among the most important are the following.


Natural Cementation and Aging
All soils undergo a natural cementation at the particle contact points. The process of aging
seems to increase the cementing effect by a variable amount. This effect was recognized
very early in cohesive soils but is now deemed of considerable importance in cohesionless
deposits as well. The effect of cementation and aging in sand is not nearly so pronounced as
for clay but still the effect as a statistical accumulation from a very large number of grain
contacts can be of significance for designing a foundation. Care must be taken to ascertain
the quantitative effects properly since sample disturbance and the small relative quantity of
grains in a laboratory sample versus site amounts may provide difficulties in making a value
measurement that is more than just an estimate. Field observations have well validated the
concept of the cementation and aging process. Loess deposits, in particular, illustrate the
beneficial effects of the cementation process where vertical banks are readily excavated.

Overconsolidation
A soil is said to be normally consolidated (nc) if the current overburden pressure (column
of soil overlying the plane of consideration) is the largest to which the mass has ever been
subjected. It has been found by experience that prior stresses on a soil element produce an
imprint or stress history that is retained by the soil structure until a new stress state exceeds
the maximum previous one. The soil is said to be overconsolidated (or preconsolidated) if
the stress history involves a stress state larger than the present overburden pressure.
Overconsolidated cohesive soils have received considerable attention. Only more recently
has it been recognized that overconsolidation may be of some importance in cohesionless
soils. A part of the problem, of course, is that it is relatively easy to ascertain overconsolidation
in cohesive soils but very difficult in cohesionless deposits. The behavior of overconsolidated
soils under new loads is different from that of normally consolidated soils, so it is important—
particularly for cohesive soils—to be able to recognize the occurrence.
The overconsolidation ratio (OCR) is defined as the ratio of the past effective pressure p'c
to the present overburden pressure p'o:
OCR = E£ (2-13)
P'o
A normally consolidated soil has OCR = 1 and an overconsolidated soil has OCR > 1.
OCR values of 1-3 are obtained for lightly overconsolidated soils. Heavily overconsolidated
soils might have OCRs > 6 to 8.
An underconsolidated soil will have OCR < 1. In this case the soil is still consolidating.
Over- or preconsolidation may be caused by a geologically deposited depth of overburden
that has since partially eroded away. Of at least equally common occurrence are preconsoli-
dation effects that result from shrinkage stresses produced by alternating wet and dry cycles.
These readily occur in arid and semiarid regions but can occur in more moderate climates as
well. Chemical actions from naturally occurring compounds may aid in producing an over-
consolidated soil deposit. Where overconsolidation occurs from shrinkage, it is common for
only the top 1 to 3 meters to be overconsolidated and the underlying material to be normally
consolidated. The OCR grades from a high value at or near the ground surface to 1 at the
normally consolidated interface.


Mode of Deposit Formation
Soil deposits that have been transported, particularly via water, tend to be made up of small
grain sizes and initially to be somewhat loose with large void ratios. They tend to be fairly
uniform in composition but may be stratified with alternating very fine material and thin
sand seams, the sand being transported and deposited during high-water periods when stream
velocity can support larger grain sizes. These deposits tend to stabilize and may become very
compact (dense) over geological periods from subsequent overburden pressure as well as
cementing and aging processes.
Soil deposits developed'where the transporting agent is a glacier tend to be more varied in
composition. These deposits may contain large sand or clay lenses. It is not unusual for glacial
deposits to contain considerable amounts of gravel and even suspended boulders. Glacial
deposits may have specific names as found in geology textbooks such as moraines, eskers,
etc.; however, for foundation work our principal interest is in the uniformity and quality of
the deposit. Dense, uniform deposits are usually not troublesome. Deposits with an erratic
composition may be satisfactory for use, but soil properties may be very difficult to obtain.
Boulders and lenses of widely varying characteristics may cause construction difficulties.
The principal consideration for residual soil deposits is the amount of rainfall that has
occurred. Large amounts of surface water tend to leach materials from the upper zones to
greater depths. A resulting stratum of fine particles at some depth can affect the strength and
settlement characteristics of the site.

Quality of the Clay
The term clay is commonly used to describe any cohesive soil deposit with sufficient clay
minerals present that drying produces shrinkage with the formation of cracks or fissures such
that block slippage can occur. Where drying has produced shrinkage cracks in the deposit
we have a fissured clay. This material can be troublesome for field sampling because the
material may be very hard, and fissures make sample recovery difficult. In laboratory strength
tests the fissures can define failure planes and produce fictitiously low strength predictions
(alternatively, testing intact pieces produces too high a prediction) compared to in situ tests
where size effects may either bridge or confine the discontinuity. A great potential for strength
reduction exists during construction where opening an excavation reduces the overburden
pressure so that expansion takes place along any fissures. Subsequent rainwater or even local
humidity can enter the fissure so that interior as well as surface softening occurs.
A clay without fissures is an intact clay and is usually normally consolidated or at least has
not been overconsolidated from shrinkage stresses. Although these clays may expand from
excavation of overburden, the subsequent access to free water is not so potentially disastrous
as for fissured clay because the water effect is more nearly confined to the surface.

Soil Water
Soil water may be a geological phenomenon; however, it can also be as recent as the latest
rainfall or broken water pipe. An increase in water content tends to decrease the shear strength
of cohesive soils. An increase in the pore pressure in any soil will reduce the shear strength. A
sufficient increase can reduce the shear strength to zero—for cohesionless soils the end result


is a viscous fluid. A saturated sand in a loose state can, from a sudden shock, also become
a viscous fluid. This phenomenon is termed liquefaction and is of considerable importance
when considering major structures (such as power plants) in earthquake-prone areas.
When soil water just dampens sand, the surface tension produced will allow shallow ex-
cavations with vertical sides. If the water evaporates, the sides will collapse; however, con-
struction vibrations can initiate a cave-in prior to complete drying. The sides of a vertical
excavation in a cohesive soil may collapse from a combination of rainfall softening the clay
together with excess water entering surface tension cracks to create hydrostatic water pres-
sure.
In any case, the shear strength of a cohesive soil can be markedly influenced by water. Even
without laboratory equipment, one has probably seen how cohesive soil strength can range
from a fluid to a brick-like material as a mudhole alongside a road fills during a rain and
subsequently dries. Ground cracks in the hole bottom after drying are shrinkage (or tension)
cracks.
Changes in the groundwater table (GWT) may produce undesirable effects—particularly
from its lowering. Since water has a buoyant effect on soil as for other materials, lowering the
GWT removes this effect and effectively increases the soil weight by that amount. This can
produce settlements, for all the underlying soil "sees" is a stress increase from this weight
increase. Very large settlements can be produced if the underlying soil has a large void ratio.
Pumping water from wells in Mexico City has produced areal settlements of several meters.
Pumping water (and oil) in the vicinity of Houston, Texas, has produced areal settlements
of more than 2 meters in places. Pumping to dewater a construction site can produce settle-
ments of 30 to 50 mm within short periods of time. If adjacent buildings cannot tolerate this
additional settlement, legal problems are certain to follow.

2-5 ROUTINE LABORATORY INDEX SOIL TESTS
Some or all of the following laboratory tests are routinely performed as part of the foundation
design process. They are listed in the descending order of likelihood of being performed for
a given project.

Water Content w
Water content determinations are made on the recovered soil samples to obtain the natural wa-
ter content w#. Liquid (W>L) and plastic (wp) tests are commonly made on cohesive soils both
for classification and for correlation studies. Water content determinations are also commonly
made in soil improvement studies (compaction, using admixtures, etc.).

Atterberg Limits
The liquid and plastic limits are routinely determined for cohesive soils. From these two limits
the plasticity index is computed as shown on Fig. 2-2a. The significance of these three terms
is indicated in Fig. 2-2a along with the qualitative effect on certain cohesive soil properties
of increasing either Ip or w/,. The plasticity index is commonly used in strength correlations;
the liquid limit is also used, primarily for consolidation estimates.
The liquid and plastic limit values, together with WM, are useful in predicting whether
a cohesive soil mass is preconsolidated. Since an overconsolidated soil is more dense, the void


ratio is smaller than in the soil remolded for the Atterberg limit tests. If the soil is located
below the groundwater table (GWT) where it is saturated, one would therefore expect that
smaller void ratios would have less water space and the WM value would be smaller. From
this we might deduce the following:

If WM is close to WL, soil is normally consolidated.
If WM is close to Wp, soil is some- to heavily overconsolidated.
If WM is intermediate, soil is somewhat overconsolidated.
If WM is greater than w/,, soil is on verge of being a viscous liquid.

Although the foregoing gives a qualitative indication of overconsolidation, other methods
must be used if a quantitative value of OCR is required.
We note that WM can be larger than H>L, which simply indicates the in situ water content
is above the liquid limit. Since the soil is existing in this state, it would seem that overbur-
den pressure and interparticle cementation are providing stability (unless visual inspection
indicates a liquid mass). It should be evident, however, that the slightest remolding distur-
bance has the potential to convert this type of deposit into a viscous fluid. Conversion may
be localized, as for pile driving, or involve a large area. The larger WM is with respect to WL,
the greater the potential for problems. The liquidity index has been proposed as a means of
quantifying this problem and is defined as
^ = WM-Wp = WM-Wp ( 2 1 4 )
WL ~ wp Ip
where, by inspection, values of Ii > 1 are indicative of a liquefaction or "quick" potential.
Another computed index that is sometimes used is the relative consistency,2 defined as
Ic = ^ f ^ (2-Ua)
IP
Here it is evident that if the natural water content WM ^ WL, the relative consistency is Ic ^
0; and if WM > WL, the relative consistency or consistency index IQ < 0.
Where site evidence indicates that the soil may be stable even where WM ^ WL, other
testing may be necessary. For example (and typical of highly conflicting site results reported
in geotechnical literature) Ladd and Foott (1974) and Koutsoftas (1980) both noted near-
surface marine deposits underlying marsh areas that exhibited large OCRs in the upper zones
with WM near or even exceeding Wi. This is, of course, contradictory to the previously given
general statements that if WM is close to Wi the soil is "normally consolidated" or is about to
become a "viscous liquid."

Grain Size
The grain size distribution test is used for soil classification and has value in designing soil
filters. A soil filter is used to allow drainage of pore water under a hydraulic gradient with

2This is the definition given by ASTM D 653, but it is more commonly termed the consistency index, particularly
outside the United States.

erosion of soil fines minimized. Frequently, the grain size test is used to determine the Dg5,
D60, Dio fractions (or percents). For example, on Fig. 2-3a, b the D85 (size for which 85
percent of sample is smaller) is about 1.1 mm for the "well-graded" soil. The Dio size is
about 0.032 mm and was determined from the hydrometer test branch of the curve. The
percent clay (particles smaller than 0.002 mm) can be determined from a grain size curve

as used for sands and silts are shown in Fig. 2-3a.

Unit Weight y
Unit weight y is fairly easy to estimate for a cohesive soil by trimming a block (or length of a
recovered tube sample) to convenient size, weighing it, and then placing it in a volumetric jar
and measuring the quantity of water required to fill the container. The unit weight is simply

If the work is done rapidly so that the sample does not have time to absorb any of the added
water a very reliable value can be obtained. The average of several trials should be used if
possible.
The unit weight of cohesionless samples is very difficult (and costly) to determine. Esti-
mated values as outlined in Chap. 3 are often used. Where more accurate values are necessary,
freezing and injection methods are sometimes used; that is, a zone is frozen or injected with a
hardening agent so that a somewhat undisturbed block can be removed to be treated similarly
as for the cohesive sample above. Where only the unit weight is required, good results can be
obtained by recovering a sample with a piston sampler (described in Chap. 3). With a known
volume initially recovered, later disturbance is of no consequence, and we have
_ Weight of sample recovered
et Initial volume of piston sample
The unit weight is necessary to compute the in situ overburden pressure po used to es-
timate OCR and is necessary in the computation of consolidation settlements of Chap. 5.
It is also used to compute lateral pressures against soil-retaining structures and to estimate
skin resistance for pile foundations. In cohesionless materials the angle of internal friction
<f> depends on the unit weight and a variation of only 1 or 2 kN/m3 may have a substantial
influence on this parameter.

Relative Density Dr
Relative density is sometimes used to describe the state condition in cohesionless soils. Rel-
ative density is defined in terms of natural, maximum, and minimum void ratios e as
Dr = *max_~ €n (2-15)
^max ^min
It can also be defined in terms of natural (in situ), maximum, and minimum unit weight y as
Dr = ( 7n ~ 7min V ^ ) (2-16)
\7max - y m i n / V Y* /
The relative density test can be made on gravelly soils if the (—) No. 200 sieve (0.074 mm)
material is less than 8 percent and for sand/ soils if the fines are not more than about 12
percent according to Holtz (1973).
The relative density Dr is commonly used to identify potential liquefaction under earth-
quake or other shock-type loadings [Seed and Idriss (1971)]; however, at present a somewhat
more direct procedure is used [Seed et al. (1985)]. It may also be used to estimate strength
(Fig. 2-30).
It is the author's opinion that the Dr test is not of much value since it is difficult to obtain
maximum and minimum unit weight values within a range of about ±0.5 kN/m3. The average
maximum value is about this amount under (say 20.0 kN/m3 - 0.5) and the minimum about
this over (say, 15.0 kN/m3 + 0.5). The definition is for the maximum and minimum values,
but average values are usually used. This value range together with the uncertainty in obtain-
ing the in situ value can give a potential range in computed Dr of up to 30 to 40 percent (0.3
to 0.4). Chapter 3 gives the common methods of estimating the in situ value of Dr. A simple


laboratory procedure is given in Bowles (1992) (experiment 18) either to compute Dr or to
obtain a unit weight for quality control.

Specific Gravity Gs
The specific gravity of the soil grains is of some value in computing the void ratio when the
unit weight and water content are known. The test is of moderate difficulty with the major
source of error deriving from the presence of entrapped air in the soil sample. Since G5 does
not vary widely for most soils, the values indicated here are commonly estimated without
performing a test.

Soil G5

Gravel 2.65-2.68
Sand 2.65-2.68
Silt, inorganic 2.62-2.68
Clay, organic 2.58-2.65
Clay, inorganic 2.68-2.75

A value of Gs = 2.67 is commonly used for cohesionless soils and a value of 2.70 for inor-
ganic clay. Where any uncertainty exists of a reliable value of G5, one should perform a test
on a minimum of three small representative samples and average the results. Values of G5 as
high as 3.0 and as low as 2.3 to 2.4 are not uncommon.

Shrinkage Limit Ws
This is one of the Atterberg limit tests that is sometimes done. The shrinkage limit is qualita-
tively illustrated in Fig. 2-2b. It has some value in estimating the probability of expansive soil
problems. Whereas a low value of Ws indicates that only a little increase in water content can
start a volume change, the test does not quantify the amount of AV. The problem of making
some kind of estimate of the amount of soil expansion is considered in Sec. 7-9.4.

2-6 SOIL CLASSIFICATION METHODS
IN FOUNDATION DESIGN
It is necessary for the foundation engineer to classify the site soils for use as a foundation for
several reasons:
1. To be able to use the database of others in predicting foundation performance.
2. To build one's own local database of successes (or any failures).
3. To maintain a permanent record that can be understood by others should problems later
develop and outside parties be required to investigate the original design.
4. To be able to contribute to the general body of knowledge in common terminology via
journal papers or conference presentations. After all, if one is to partake in the contributions
of others, one should be making contributions to the general knowledge base and not be
just a "taker."


The Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) of Table 2-1 is much used in foundation
work. A version of this system has been standardized by ASTM as D 2487 (in Volume 04.08:
Soil and Rock; Dimension Stone; Geosynthetics). The standardized version is similar to the
original USCS as given by Casagrande (1948) but with specified percentages of sand or
gravel passing specific sieves being used to give the "visual description" of the soil. The
original Casagrande USCS only classified the soil using the symbols shown in Table 2-1
(GP, GW, SM, SP, CL, CH, etc.), based on the indicated percentages passing the No. 4 and
No. 200 sieves and the plasticity data. The author has always suggested a visual description
supplement such as the following:

Soil data available Soil description (using Table 2-1)

Sand, Cu = 7; Cc = 1.3, 95% passing No. Well-graded, brown sand with a trace of
4 sieve, brown color gravel, SW
Gravel, 45% passes No. 4, 25% passes No. Tan clayey gravel with sand, GC
200; wL = 42, wP = 22, tan color
70% passes No. 4 and 18% passes No. 200 Organic gravelly, clayey sand, SC
sieve; wL = 56; wP = 24. Sample is firm
and dark in color with a distinct odor

It is evident in this table that terms "trace" and "with" are somewhat subjective. The
soil color, such as "blue clay," "gray clay," etc., is particularly useful in soil classification.
In many areas the color—particularly of cohesive soils—is an indication of the presence of the

same soil stratum as found elsewhere. For example the "soft blue clay" on the soil profile of
Fig. 2-4 for Chicago has about the same properties at any site in the Chicago area.
In foundation work the terms loose, medium, and dense, as shown in Table 3-4, and consis-
tency descriptions such as soft, stiff, very stiff, etc., as shown in Table 3-5, are also commonly
used in foundation soil classification. Clearly, all of these descriptive terms are of great use
to the local geotechnical engineer but are somewhat subjective. That is, there could easily be
some debate over what is a "medium" versus a "dense" sand, for example.
The D 2487 standard removed some of the subjectiveness of the classification and requires
the following terminology:
< 15% is sand or gravel use name (organic clay, silt, etc.)
15% < x < 30% is sand or gravel describe as clay or silt with sand, or clay
or silt with gravel
> 30% is sand or gravel describe as sandy clay, silty clay, or gravelly
clay, gravelly silt
The gravel or sand classification is based on the percentage retained on the No. 4 (gravel)
sieve or passing the No. 4 and retained on the No. 200 (sand) sieves. This explanation is only
partial, as the new standard is too lengthy for the purpose of this textbook to be presented in
detail.
Although not stated in D 2487, the standard is devised for using a computer program3
to classify the soil. Further, not all geotechnical engineers directly use the ASTM standard,
particularly if their practice has a history of success using the original USC system.

General Comments on Using Table 2-1
1. When the WL-IP intersection is very close to the "A" or WL = 50% line, use dual symbols
such as SC-SM, CL-ML, organic OL-OH, etc. to indicate the soil is borderline.
2. If the WL-IP intersection is above the "U" line one should carefully check that the tests
and data reduction are correctly done. It may require redoing the limits tests as a check.
The reason for this caution is that this line represents the upper limit of real soils so far
analyzed.

Peat and Organic Soils
Strictly, peat is not a soil but rather an organic deposit of rotting wood from trees, plants,
and mosses. If the deposit is primarily composed of moss, it may be termed a sphagnum
peat. If the deposit has been somewhat contaminated with soil particles (silt, clay, sand) it
may be named for the soil particles present as peaty silt, peaty sand, peaty clay, and so on. If
the soil contamination is substantial (in a relative sense) the soil is more likely to be termed an

organic soil. Generally a "peat" deposit is classified as such from visual inspection of the
recovered samples.
There have been a number of attempts to quantify various engineering properties of peat
(or peaty) deposits; however, it is usually necessary to consider the properties of each site.
Several engineering properties such as unit weight, compressibility, and permeability will be
heavily dependent on the type, relative quantity, and degree of decomposition (state) of the
organic material present. Several recent references have attempted to address some of these
problems:
Landva and Pheeney (1980)
Berry and Vickers (1975)
Edil and Dhowian (1981)
Loetal. (1990)
Fox etal. (1992)
Stinnette (1992)
Organic soils are defined as soil deposits that contain a mixture of soil particles and or-
ganic (peat) matter. They may be identified by observation of peat-type materials, a dark color,
and/or a woody odor. ASTM (D 2487 Section 11.3.2) currently suggests that the organic clas-
sification (OL, OH shown on the "A" chart of Table 2-1) be obtained by performing the liquid
limit on the natural soil, then oven-drying the sample overnight and performing a second liq-
uid limit test on the oven-dry material. If the liquid limit test after oven drying is less than 75
percent of that obtained from the undried soil, the soil is "organic." Oven drying of organic
soils requires special procedures as given in ASTM D 2974.
After performing the liquid and plastic limits, one classifies an organic soil using the "A"
chart of Table 2-1. The soil may be either an organic silt OL, OH, or an organic clay OL, OH
depending on the liquid limit Wp and plasticity index Ip and where these values plot on the
"A" chart. It is necessary to use both the qualifier "organic silt" or "organic clay" and the
symbol OL or OH.

Approximate Field Procedures for Soil Identification
It is sometimes useful to be able to make a rapid field identification of the site soil for some
purpose. This can be done approximately as follows:
1. Differentiate gravel and sand by visual inspection.
2. Differentiate fine sand and silt by placing a spoonful of the soil in a deep jar (or test tube)
and shaking it to make a suspension. Sand settles out in \\ minutes or less whereas silt
may take 5 or more minutes. This test may also be used for clay, which takes usually more
than 10 minutes. The relative quantities of materials can be obtained by observing the
depths of the several materials in the bottom sediment.
3. Differentiate between silt and clay as follows:
a. Clay lumps are more difficult to crush using the fingers than silt.
b. Moisten a spot on the soil lump and rub your finger across it. If it is smooth it is clay;
if marginally streaked it is clay with silt; if rough it is silt.


c. Form a plastic ball of the soil material and shake it horizontally by jarring your hand.
If the material becomes shiny from water coming to the surface it is silt.
4. Differentiate between organic and inorganic soils by visual inspection for organic material
or a smell test for wood or plant decay odor.

2-7 SOIL MATERIAL CLASSIFICATION TERMS
The soil classification terms shown in Table 2-1 are widely used in classification. A number
of other terms are used both by engineers and construction personnel, or tend to be localized.
A few of these terms will be defined here as a reader convenience.

Bedrock

This is a common name for the parent rock, but generally implies a rock formation at a depth in
the ground on which a structure may be founded. All other rocks and soils are derived from the
original bedrock formed from cooling of molten magma and subsequent weathering. Bedrock
extends substantially downward to molten magma and laterally in substantial dimensions.
The lowermost part is igneous rock formed by cooling of the molten magma. This may, or
may not, be overlain by one or more layers of more recently formed sedimentary rocks such
as sandstone, limestone, shale, etc. formed from indurated soil deposits. The interface layers
between igneous and sedimentary rocks may be metamorphic rocks formed from intense heat
and pressure acting on the sedimentary rocks. In some cases a bedding rock layer—usually
sedimentary in origin—may overlie a soil deposit. In earthquake areas the parent rock may
be much fractured. Past areal uplifts may have produced zones of highly fragmented parent
rock at the bedrock level.
Considering these factors, one might say that generally, bedrock makes a satisfactory foun-
dation, but good engineering practice requires that one check the geological history of the site.
In this context it is fairly common to refer to the bedrock with respect to the geological age
of estimated formation as Cambrian, pre-Cambrian, etc.

Boulders

Boulders are large pieces of rock fractured from the parent material or blown out of volcanos
(called bombs in this case). They may have volumes ranging from about \ to 8 or 10 m3 and
weigh from about one-half to several hundred tonnes. They may create disposal or excavation
problems on or near the ground surface and problems in soil exploration or pile driving at
greater depths when suspended in the soil matrix, as in glacial till. Large ones may be suitable
to found pile or caissons on; however, size determination may be difficult, and placing a large
load on a small suspended boulder may be disastrous.

Gravels and Smaller
Rock fragments smaller than boulders grade into cobbles, pebbles, gravel, sand, silt, and
colloids in order of size as shown on Table 2-2. Crushed stone is gravel manufactured by
crushing rock fragments from boulders or obtained from suitable rock formations by min-
ing. Bank-run gravel is a common term for naturally occurring gravel lenses deposited along

rivers or from glaciers. Pea gravel is gravel screened to contain only sizes in a certain range
(usually about 6 down to 3 mm) and is poorly graded because the > 6 mm and < 3 mm sizes
are missing.
Gravels, sands, and silts are cohesionless materials that exist in deposits ranging from a
state of loose to dense and coarse to fine. Most deposits, however, are in a medium to fairly
dense state. These materials can have cohesion from clay minerals in the fine sand and silt
filler that may be present.

Silt

Silts and clays are of particular interest in foundation engineering because they tend to be
most troublesome in terms of strength and settlements. Silts and rock flour in the particle
range of 0.074 mm down to about 0.001 mm are inert by-products of rock weathering. They
may be organic silts (OL, OH) if contaminated with organic materials or inorganic (ML, MH)
otherwise. Damp silt has an apparent cohesion from the cumulative effect of surface tension
on the many small particles, but on drying minimal shrinkage (unless organic) takes place
and the resulting dry lumps are easily broken by finger pressure.
Most silt deposits, however, are contaminated with clay minerals so that they have co-
hesion (dry lumps are not so easily broken). As little as 5 to 8 percent clay can give a silt
deposit considerable cohesion, depending on the silt grain sizes and the type of clay mineral.
At higher percentages of clay, or depending on its visual effects, a silt deposit may be loosely
termed "clay," particularly by construction personnel. From an engineering viewpoint, how-
ever, we can see from the "A" chart of Table 2-1 that it is quite possible for a "clay" to have
lower plasticity characteristics than a silt, i.e., a CL of say Wi = 35 and Ip = 15 versus a
MHofH>L = 60and//> = 25.

Clay

The clay size (particles 0.002 mm and smaller) overlaps the silt sizes somewhat. The essential
difference between the two, however, is that a clay mineral is not inert. It is a complex hydro-
aluminum silicate,


where n and k are numerical values of attached molecules and vary for the same mass. The
clay mineral has a high affinity for water, and individual particles may absorb 10O+ times the
particle volume. The presence or absence (during drying) of water can produce very large
volume and strength changes. Clay particles also have very strong interparticle attractive
forces, which account in part for the very high strength of a dry lump (or a clay brick). Water
absorption and interparticle attraction collectively give the activity and cohesion to clay (and
to soils containing clay minerals).
The three principal identified clay minerals can be characterized in terms of activity and
plasticity:

Montmorillonite (or smectite)—Most active of the identified minerals. The activity, in
terms of affinity for water and swell, makes this material ideal for use as a drilling mud in
soil exploration and in drilling oil wells. It is also commonly injected into the ground around
basement walls as a water barrier (swells to close off water flow paths) to stop basement
leaks. It is also blended with local site material to produce water barriers to protect the GWT
from sanitary landfill drainage. The Ip of an uncontaminated montmorillonite is 15O+.
Illite—A clay mineral that is intermediate in terms of activity. The Ip of a pure illite ranges
from about 30 to 50.
Kaolinite—The clay mineral with the least activity. This material is commonly used in the
ceramic industry and for brick manufacture. It is sometimes used as an absorbent for stomach
medicine. The Ip of a pure kaolinite ranges from about 15 to 20.

Montmorillonite deposits are found mostly in arid and semiarid regions. All clay miner-
als weather into less active materials, e.g., to illite and then to kaolinite. As a consequence
most "clay" deposits contain several different clay minerals. Only deposits of relatively pure
clay have commercial value. Most of the remainder represent engineering problems. For ex-
ample, in temperate regions it is not unusual for deposits to contain substantial amounts of
montmorillonite or even lenses of nearly pure material.
Clay deposits with certain characteristics are common to certain areas and have been
named for the location. For example the "Chicago blue clay," "Boston blue clay," "London
clay" shown in Fig. 2-4 are common for those areas. Leda clay is found in large areas of
Ottawa Province in Canada and has been extensively studied and reported in the Canadian
Geotechnical Journal.

Local Terminology
The following are terms describing soil deposits that the geotechnical engineer may en-
counter. Familiarity with their meaning is useful.

a. Adobe. A clayey material found notably in the Southwest.
b. Caliche. A conglomeration of sand, gravel, silt, and clay bonded by carbonates and usually
found in arid areas.
c. Glacial till or glacial drift. A mixture of material that may include sand, gravel, silt, and
clay deposited by glacial action. Large areas of central North America, much of Canada,
northern Europe, the Scandinavian countries, and the British Isles are overlain with glacial


till or drift. The term drift is usually used to describe any materials laid down by the
glacier. The term till is usually used to describe materials precipitated out of the ice, but
the user must check the context of usage, as the terms are used interchangeably. Moraines
are glacial deposits scraped or pushed ahead (terminal), or alongside the glacier (lateral).
These deposits may also be called ground moraines if formed by seasonal advances and
retreats of a glacier. The Chicago, Illinois, area, for example, is underlain by three identi-
fiable ground moraines.
d. Gumbo. A clayey or loamy material that is very sticky when wet.
e. Hardpan. This term may be used to describe caliche or any other dense, firm deposits that
are excavated with difficulty.
/ Loam. A mixture of sand, clay, silt; an organic material; also called topsoil.
g. Loess. A uniform deposit of silt-sized material formed by wind action. Often found along
the Mississippi River, where rising damp air affects the density of the air transporting the
material, causing it to deposit out. Such deposits are not, however, confined to the Mis-
sissippi Valley. Large areas of Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana are covered by loess.
Large areas of China, Siberia, and southeastern Europe (southern Russia and Ukraine)
and some areas of western Europe are covered with loess. Loess is considered to be a
transported soil.
h. Muck. A thin watery mixture of soil and organic material.
i. Alluvial deposits. Soil deposits formed by sedimentation of soil particles from flowing
water; may be lake deposits if found in lake beds; deltas at the mouths of rivers; marine
deposits if deposited through saltwater along and on the continental shelf. Alluvial deposits
are found worldwide. For example, New Orleans, Louisiana, is located on a delta deposit.
The low countries of The Netherlands and Belgium are founded on alluvial deposits from
the Rhine River exiting into the North Sea. Lake deposits are found around and beneath
the Great Lakes area of the United States and Canada. Large areas of the Atlantic coastal
plain, including the eastern parts of Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, the eastern part and
most of south Georgia, Florida, south Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas consist
of alluvial deposits. These deposits formed when much of this land was covered with the
seas. Later upheavals such as that forming the Appalachian mountains have exposed this
material. Alluvial deposits are fine-grained materials, generally silt-clay mixtures, silts,
or clays and fine to medium sands. If the sand and clay layers alternate, the deposit is a
varved clay. Alluvial deposits are usually soft and highly compressible.
j . Black cotton soils. Semitropical soils found in areas where the annual rainfall is 500 to
750 mm. They range from black to dark gray. They tend to become hard with very large
cracks (large-volume-change soils) when dry and very soft and spongy when wet. These
soils are found in large areas of Australia, India, and southeast Asia.
k. Late rites. Another name for residual soils found in tropical areas with heavy rainfalls.
These soils are typically bright red to reddish brown in color. They are formed initially by
weathering of igneous rocks, with the subsequent leaching and chemical erosion due to
the high temperature and rainfall. Collodial silica is leached downward, leaving behind
aluminum and iron. The latter becomes highly oxidized, and both are relatively insoluble
in the high-pH environment (greater than 7). Well-developed laterite soils are generally
porous and relatively incompressible. Lateritic soils are found in Alabama, Georgia, South


Carolina, many of the Caribbean islands, large areas of Central and South America, and
parts of India, southeast Asia, and Africa.
/. Saprolite. Still another name for residual soils formed from weathered rock. These deposits
are often characterized by a particle range from dust to large angular stones. Check the
context of use to see if the term is being used to describe laterite soils or residual soils.
m. Shale. A fine-grained, sedimentary rock composed essentially of compressed and/or ce-
mented clay particles. It is usually laminated, owing to the general parallel orientation of
the clay particles, as distinct from claystone or siltstone, which are indurated deposits of
random particle orientation. According to Underwood (1967), shale is the predominant
sedimentary rock in the Earth's crust. It is often misclassified; layered sedimentary rocks
of quartz or argillaceous materials such as argillite are not shale. Shale may be grouped as
(1) compaction shale and (2) cemented (rock) shale. The compaction shale is a transition
material from soil to rock and can be excavated with modern earth excavation equipment.
Cemented shale can sometimes be excavated with excavation equipment but more gener-
ally requires blasting. Compaction shales have been formed by consolidation pressure and
very little cementing action. Cemented shales are formed by a combination of cementing
and consolidation pressure. They tend to ring when struck by a hammer, do not slake in
water, and have the general characteristics of good rock. Compaction shales, being of an
intermediate quality, will generally soften and expand upon exposure to weathering when
excavations are opened. Shales may be clayey, silty, or sandy if the composition is pre-
dominantly clay, silt, or sand, respectively. Dry unit weight of shale may range from about
12.5 kN/m3 for poor-quality compaction shale to 25.1 kN/m3 for high-quality cemented
shale.

2-8 IN SITU STRESSES AND K0 CONDITIONS
Any new foundation load—either an increase (+) from a foundation or a decrease ( - ) from
an excavation—imposes new stresses on the existing state of "locked in" stresses in the foun-
dation soil mass. The mass response is heavily dependent on the previous stress history, so
one of the most important considerations in foundation engineering is to ascertain this stress
imprint. The term imprint is used since any previously applied stresses that are larger than
those currently existing have been locked into the soil structure and will affect subsequent
stress-response behavior until a new set of larger stresses are applied to produce a new im-
print. Of course, the stress history is lost in varying degrees (or completely) when the soil
is excavated/remolded or otherwise disturbed as in sample recovery. Factors contributing to
loss of stress history during sampling are outlined in Sec. 3-5.
In situ, the vertical stresses act on a horizontal plane at some depth z. These can be com-
puted in any general case as the sum of contributions from n strata of unit weight yr and
thickness Zi as
n
Po = ^ JiZt (a)
i = l
The unit weight for a homogeneous stratum is of the general form
(b)


with the constants A\, A2, and m determined by obtaining weight values at several depths z
and plotting a best-fit curve. In practice, at least for reasonable depths on the order of 5 to
10 meters, a constant value is often (incorrectly) used. An alternative is to divide the deposit
into several "layers" and use a constant unit weight y,- for each as in Eq. (a).
In most cases involving geotechnical work, the effective stress p'o is required so that below
the GWT one uses the effective soil unit weight computed as
y' = 7 sat - Tw (c)
For any soil deposit formation the plan area is usually rather large and the depth continually
increases until either deposition or interior weathering stops. This change produces a gradual
vertical compression of the soil at any given depth; similarly, y increases under compression
so that in nearly all cases unit weight y — f (depth). Since the lateral dimension is large
there is little reason for significant lateral compression to occur. For this reason it is logical to
expect that vertical locked-in effective stresses p'o would be larger than the effective lateral
stresses a'h at the same point. We may define the ratio of the horizontal to vertical stresses as
K = ^ (d)
Po
which is valid for any depth z at any time.
Over geological time the stresses in a soil mass at a particular level stabilize into a steady
state and strains become zero. When this occurs the vertical and lateral stresses become prin-
cipal stresses acting on principal planes.4 This effective stress state is termed the at-rest or
K0 condition with K0 defined as

Ko = ^t (2-17)
Po
Figure 2-5 qualitatively illustrates the range of K0 and the relationship of po and ah in any
homogeneous soil. Note the qualitative curves for preconsolidation in the upper zone of some
soil from shrinkage/chemical effects. This figure (see also Fig. 2-45) clearly illustrates the
anisotropic (av ¥^ ah) stress state in a soil mass.
Because of the sampling limitations given in Sec. 3-5 it is an extremely difficult task to
measure K0 either in the laboratory or in situ. A number of laboratory and field methods
are cited by Abdelhamid and Krizek (1976); however, from practical limitations the direct
simple shear device (Fig. 2-266) is the simplest for direct laboratory measurements. Field
methods will be considered in the next chapter, but note that they are very costly for the
slight improvement—in most cases—over using one of the simple estimates following. In
these equations use the effective angle of internal friction </>' and not the total stress value.
Jaky (1948) presented a derived equation for K0 that is applicable to both soil and agri-
cultural grains (such as corn, wheat, oats, etc.) as

4Stresses acting on planes on which no strains or shearing stresses exist are defined as principal stresses, and the
planes are principal planes.


Figure 2-5 Qualitative vertical and lateral
pressures in a soil. Although the linear ver-
tical (also called geostatic) pressure profile
is commonly used, the p"0 effective pressure
profile is more realistic of real soils since
y usually increases with depth. The lateral
pressure profile range is for the geostatic
pressure profile and would be curved simi-
larly to the p"o curve for real soils.

which has been simplified—and erroneously called "Jaky's equation"—to the following:
K0 = l-sin</>' (2-18a)
This equation is very widely used and has proved reasonably reliable [see extensive regres-
sion analysis by Mayne and Kulhawy (1982)] in comparing initial to back-computed K0
values in a number of cases and for normally consolidated materials. Kezdi (1972) suggests
that for sloping ground Jaky's equation can be used as follows:
_ l - s i n < f r '
Ko ~ l + sin/3 ( 2 " 1 9 )
where /3 is the angle with the horizontal with sign so that K0 is either increased or reduced
as site conditions dictate. This reference also gives a partial derivation of the Jaky equation
for any interested user.
Brooker and Ireland (1965) (for normally consolidated clay) suggest
K0 = 0 . 9 5 - s i n 0' (2-20)
Alpan (1967) (for normally consolidated clay) suggests
K0 = 0.19 H- 0.233 log10 Ip (2-21)
An equation similar to Eq. (2-21) is given by Holtz and Kovacs (1981, on Fig. 11.69) as
K0 = 0.44 + 0.0042/p (2-2Ia)
where Ip is in percent for both Eqs. (2-21).
We can readily derive a value for K0 in terms of Poisson's ratio based on the definition of
K0 being an effective stress state at zero strain. From Hooke's law [Eq. (2-64)] the lateral

€x = 0 = -=r(crx - }i(Ty - pat) = ez

With (Tx = az = K0(Ty we obtain, on substitution into the preceding and canceling,

K0 = J ^ - (2-22)

For a cohesionless soil /JL is often assumed as 0.3 to 0.4, which gives K0 = 0.43 to 0.67, with
a value of 0.5 often used.
It is extremely difficult to obtain a reliable estimate of K0 in a normally consolidated soil,
and even more so in overconsolidated soils (OCR > 1). A number of empirical equations
based on various correlations have been given in the literature [see the large number with
cited references given by Mesri and Hay at (1993)]. Several of the more promising ones are:

Alpan (1967) and others have suggested that the overconsolidated consolidation ratio
^aOCR is related to the normally consolidated value Ko>nc in the following form
^ , O C R = Ko,nc X OCR" (2-23)
where n = /(test, soil, locale) with a value range from about 0.25 to 1.25. For overconsol-
idated sand, n can be estimated from Fig. 2-6. For cohesive soil, Wroth and Houlsby (1985,
p. 12) suggest n as follows:
n = 0.42 (low plasticity—1P < 40%)
n = 0.32 (high plasticity—IP > 40%)
However, n ~ 0.95 to 0.98 was obtained from in situ tests on several clays in eastern Canada
[Hamouche et al. (1995)].
Mayne and Kulhawy (1982) suggest that a mean value of n = 0.5 is applicable for both
sands and clays and that n = sin</>' is also a good representation for sand. Their sugges-

pan (1967).]

tions are based on a semi-statistical analysis of a very large number of soils reported in the
literature.
The exponent n for clays was also given by Alpan (1967) in graph format and uses the
plasticity index IP (in percent). The author modified the equation shown on that graph to
obtain
n = 0.54 X 1(T

7 ^8 1 (2-24)
And, as previously suggested (for sands), we can use
n = SiTi(I)' (2'7Aa)
The n-values previously given by Wroth and Houlsby (1985) can be obtained from Eq.
(2-24) using an average "low plasticity" Ip of about 30 (n = 0.42) and a "high plasticity" Ip
of about 65 percent (n = 0.32).
Mayne (1984) suggests that the range of valid values for the overconsolidated KOOCR using
Eq. (2-23) for cohesive soils depends on the normalized strength ratio sjp'c being less than
4—at least for noncemented and intact clays. Therefore, this ratio is indirectly used for Eq.
(2-23), but it will be directly used in the following section.

2-8.1 Overconsolidated K0 Conditions
The equation for the overconsolidation ratio (OCR) was given in Sec. 2-4, and it is repeated
here for convenience:

OCR = ^- (2-13)
Po
In this equation the current overburden pressure p'o can be computed reasonably well, but
the value of the preconsolidation pressure p'c is at best an estimate, making a reliable compu-
tation for OCR difficult. The only method at present that is reasonably reliable is to use the
consolidation test described in Sec. 2-10 to obtain p'c. The alternative, which is likely to be
less precise, is to use some kind of in situ testing to obtain the sjp • ratio (where / = o or c)
and use a chart such as Fig. 2-36 given later in Sec. 2-11.9.
There are a number of empirical correlations for OCR based on the su/p'o ratio (the
undrained shear strength, su, divided by the current in situ effective overburden pressure p'o)
and on in situ tests that are defined later in Chap. 3. The following were taken from Chang
(1991):
For the field vane test:
OCR = 22(sM//7;)fv(/p)-a48

0.08 + 0.55/p

For the cone penetrometer test:

[see Eq. (2-60)]


These two 5-values are then used to compute the OCR as
OCR = (^S1)U3+(UM(SS1)
Section 3-11.1 gives an alternative method to compute the OCR from a cone penetration test
using Eqs. (3-17).
For the flat dilatometer test:
OCR = 0.24/^3 2
In these equations Ip = plasticity index in percentage; qc = cone resistance; po = total
(not effective) overburden pressure; Nk = cone factor that is nearly constant at Nk = 12 for
OCR < 8; KD = horizontal stress index for the dilatometer. AU of these terms (see Symbol
list) are either used later in this chapter or in Chap. 3. There are a number of other equations
given by Chang but these tend to summarize his discussion best.
With the value of OCR and the current in situ effective pressure p'o one can use Eq. (2-13)
to back-compute the preconsolidation pressure p'c.
An estimate for KOOCK is given by Mayne (1984) based on the analysis of a number of
clay soils reported in the literature. The equation is as follows:
^,OCR = Ko,nc(A + Sjp'o) (2-25)
In this equation note that the ratio su/p'o uses the effective current overburden pressure p'o.
The variable A depends on the type of laboratory test used to obtain the sjp'c ratio as follows:

Test A Comments
CAT0UC 0.7 K0 -consolidated—undrained compression
CIUC 0.8 Isotropically consolidated
C^0 DSS 1.0 Direct simple shear test

The upper limit of KOtOCR appears to be the passive earth pressure coefficient Kp (defined
in Chap. 11), and a number of values reported in the literature range from 1.5 to 1.7. It would
appear that the upper limit of any normally consolidated soil would be KOjnc < 1.0 since a
fluid such as water has K0 = 1.0 and no normally consolidated soil would have a value this
large.

Example 2-2. Compare K0 by the several approximate methods given in this section for both a
normally consolidated (nc) clay and for a clay with a known value of OCR = 5.0.
Other data: <f>' = 20° IP = 35% (nc)
0' = 25° Ip = 32% (OCR = 5)

Solution. For the normally consolidated case, we may write the following:

1. Use Brooker and Ireland's Eq. (2-20):
Ko,nc = 0.95 - sincf)' = 0.95 - sin20 = 0.61
2. Use Eqs. (2-21):


In the absence of better data, use the average of these as
„ _ 0.61 + 0.55 + 0.59 _

For the overconsolidated case, we calculate as follows:

1. Use Eq. (2-23), but first use Eq. (2-24) to find exponent n:
n = 0.54 X 1(T7^81 -> n = 0.42 for//> = 32%
Now, KO,OCR = Ko,nc X OCR" -^ use Ko>nc = 0.58 just found
KO,OCR = 0.58 X OCR042 = 0.58 X 5042 = 1.14
2. Use Eq. (2-2Aa) for an alternative n:

n = sin<£' = sin 25 = 0.423
KO,OCR = 0.58 x 50423 = 1.15 (vs. 1.14 just computed)
3. Use Eq. (2-25) and assume CIUC testing so A = 0.8. Also estimate a value for sjp'c. For this
use Eq. (2-59) following:

^- = 0 . 4 5 ^ [Eq. (2-59)]
Po
= 0.45(0.35)° 5 = 0.27 (using nc value for IP)
Substitution into Eq. (2-25) gives
tfo.ocR = 0.58(0.8 + 0.27) = 0.62
We can obtain a best estimate using all three values to obtain
1.14+1.15 + 0.62
A-^OCR = ^ = W.^7

or, since 0.62 is little different from the average nc value of 0.58, we might only use the two
values of 1.14 and 1.15 to obtain
1.14+1.15
A.O>OCR = 2 •
One should use a value of about 1.1, as 1.14 implies more precision than is justified by these
procedures.
Conventional usage is to call all values K0. For computations such as in this example it is nec-
essary to distinguish between the normally consolidated value Ko>nc and the overconsolidated value
K0 OCR as a compact means of identification in equations such as Eqs. (2-23) and (2-25).

2-9 SOIL WATER; SOIL HYDRAULICS
The presence or absence of soil water can have a considerable effect on soil strength and the
duration of settlements. In estimating the time for foundation settlements to take place, or for
water flow studies, permeability (or hydraulic conductivity) is the property of interest. We
may define permeability as the facility for water flow through a soil mass. It is quantified as
a coefficient k in units of flow (ft/s, m/s, etc.).
AU natural soil deposits contain free water in their voids. After prolonged dry periods the
amount of water may be quite small in the soil near the ground surface, but immediately
after a rain the voids may be nearly filled. There is a transition zone of variable water content
down to the groundwater table (GWT); however, at and near the water table, the soil remains
very nearly saturated. Soil below the GWT is saturated; however, recovered samples may
compute saturation values somewhat less than 100 percent as a result of drainage or loss of
hydrostatic pressure during recovery, which allows dissolved air to come out of solution and
occupy some of the sample void space.
Water below the GWT surface is usually flowing under a hydraulic gradient, defined as
the slope of the free water surface in the direction of flow. This slope could be defined by
installing a series of vertical tubes (called piezometers) in the soil along the flow direction. In
some cases depressions in impervious soils will capture the groundwater to form essentially
underground lakes called perched water tables. These may be lost by well pumping or by
making drill holes through their impervious bottoms that allow the water to drain down—
inadvertently or otherwise.
As previously stated the soil zone above the GWT is transient in terms of pore water;
however, a zone of some depth immediately adjacent to the GWT may be nearly saturated by
capillary water. Capillary water is not free to move, as it is held in place by surface tension,
and its presence produces an increase in the unit weight. The height of capillary rise can be
estimated from computations as shown in Fig. 2-7. Theoretically this rise can be substantial,
but few laboratory measurements have found values much over 1 to 2 m. Below the GWT
the free water exerts a buoyant or flotation effect on the soil.
If one places a small tube to some depth into the soil below the GWT, free water will rise
in the tube to the GWT level at that point. If we apply a load to the soil such that the void ratio
in the vicinity of this piezometer tube decreases, there will be a rise in the elevation of the
tube water. This rise is the increase in pore pressure caused by the void reduction and produces

excess free water, which will eventually drain away at a rate depending on the permeability
of the soil. As this excess pore water drains, the water level in the piezometer tube will fall
and when all of the excess has drained, the tube level is back to that of the outside GWT. If
the tube is inserted into the capillary zone or above, no water level shows in the piezometer
tube. This state may change, however, if some loading produces sufficient void ratio reduction
that an excess of pore water develops. From this discussion it is evident that we have some
chance of measuring a pore pressure when the soil starts from a saturated condition. When the
soil is not saturated, the change in voids may produce excess pore pressures in some voids
while adjacent voids are still not filled with water; thus, any pore pressure measurement
would depend on the chance location of the piezometer. In other words, if the soil is partially
saturated, pore pressure measurements are difficult-to-impossible to make. In passing, note
that if the voids increase under load, the water level in the piezometer tube may drop, and we
say the soil develops suction, which is another term used for a negative pore pressure.
This discussion enables us to define the pore pressure as "the hydrostatic pressure from
the column of water in a piezometer tube above the tube tip." If the water level is different
from the static water level outside the tube we have an excess pore pressure Aw. The excess
pressure is from the elevation difference and may be (+) if the water level in the tube is above
or (-) if the tube level is below the outside static level.

Effective Pressure
The effective pressure on a plane is developed from grain-to-grain contacts (but computed as
a nominal area contact of P/A). The effective pressure produces friction resistance between
soil particles, a component of soil strength, and produces the stresses necessary to cause
particle rolling and sliding into a more dense structure called settlement. When the soil mass
is below the free water surface (the GWT), it is buoyed according to Archimedes' principle.
This buoyant effect is readily computed since it is the same for any submerged body. The
upward buoyant force is computed as
* up = ywZwA
When the body is under the water a depth z'w there is likewise a downward water force acting
on top, computed just as above. Since a unit area (A = 1) is commonly used, we tend to use
pressures rather than forces. So we have
O-Up = 7wZ'w + 7wZn = 7w(z'w + Zn) = JwZw
since z'w + zn = zw = depth to bottom of soil of thickness zn>
The concept of effective pressure will be illustrated from the conditions shown in Fig. 2-8.
This figure should be carefully studied, as it illustrates several features common to analyzing
for effective pressure. As a preliminary discussion, note that we know the average natural wa-
ter content WN in the top 2 m of the sand stratum. We would probably estimate G8 = 2.65 as
shown, and it is common to assume a constant unit weight value rather than make allowance
for any probable increase—even small—with depth. The unit weight of the sand soil below
the water table might be obtained from a tube (or more likely a piston) sample or estimated
using procedures from Chap. 3. From these data we can estimate the wet unit weight of
the soil above the water table using computations similar to those shown in the figure. Note
the use of the block diagram, which displays known relationships and known quantities (total

volume and unit weight of soil below the water table), to obtain the dry unit weight of the sand
from saturated conditions in order to be able to compute the wet unit weight of the sand above
the GWT. From these computations we obtain the wet unit weight (shown on the figure) as
7wet = 18.10 kN/m3 ysat = 19.61 kN/m3 (given in Fig. 2-8)
The sand above the GWT being pervious (has large k)9 the water table will seek a minimum
energy profile, and the GWT represents this water level. In general, the GWT slopes, but over
relatively short distances it is nearly horizontal and is generally shown that way (as here).
Our question, however, is, what is the effective pressure on plane ABl It is customary to
use in the computations a column of soil that is square with A = I unit. We have placed a

piezometer tube in the soil with the tip at plane AB to measure the water pressure at this point,
which in this case is obviously the static head of 3 meters. The piezometer is to illustrate site
conditions and would not be likely to be installed in a real case.
The total pressure on plane AB can be readily computed using Eq. (a) but is intuitively
obtained from stacking the several soil cubes overlying the point of interest (here plane AB)
of unit area and unit height to obtain
0"down = 2 cubes X ywet + 3 cubes X ysat
The use of fractional cube heights (as 1.2, 2.3, 2.7, etc.) is permissible, but here all cube
heights are integers. Since we have used a unit area, we see that the product of y, kN/m3 X h,
m gives kN/m2 = kPa, which is pressure. Inserting numbers in the foregoing equation we
have the total pressure on plane AB as
tf-down = 2(18.10) + 3(19.61) = 95.03 kPa
The water (or pore) pressure at the piezometer tip acts in all directions so that the upward
component "floats" or reduces the total downward pressure, with the net difference being the
effective pressure p'o or, in equation form,
Po = Po ~ pore pressure (^ 0)
A negative effective pressure would indicate tension stresses, in which the soil particles are
separated or on the verge of separation, and is meaningless. The pore pressure is usually
designated as u (or when it is in excess of the GWT as AM) SO that the "effective" pressure
on plane AB is
p'o = 95.03 - 3(9.807) = 65.61 kPa

Excess Pore Pressure Aw
What height of water h (above the GWT) in the piezometer tube would reduce the effective
pressure on plane AB to zero? Since the water height in the piezometer is above the GWT,
this is a (+) excess pore pressure, and from the method of computing effective pressures just
used we can write
p'o = 0 = Po - u - AM
and, inserting values,
0 = 95.03 - 3(9.807) - A/i(9.807)

Ah = J j ^ = 6.69 m (above the GWT)
9.0U/
In other words, if we quickly poured water into the tube to a height of 6.69 - 2 = 4.69 m
above the existing ground surface, the effective pressure on plane AB would be zero. With
no grain-to-grain contact pressure the sand is in a state of liquefaction, similar to a liquid
(here a viscous fluid). In this state sand is most dangerous, either to simply walk on or to use
construction equipment on it or in the immediate vicinity.
Also observe we stated that we would "quickly pour" the water into the tube. This qualifier
is made because sand has a relatively large coefficient of permeability and water would drain


out the tip. If it drained as fast as we poured it in, we could not develop the excess pore
pressure.
The water table tends to flow laterally under its hydraulic gradient. When water is poured
into the piezometer tube, we create a vertical hydraulic gradient, for the tube represents the
minimum flow distance to reduce the excess pressure. The length of time for the water in the
tube to return to the GWT level outside the tube would depend on the permeability of the soil.
For sands and gravels this time would be relatively short. For cohesive soils and sands and
gravels with appreciable fines this time could be considerable.
There is a real-life analog to pouring water into the piezometer tube. That is where we have
a saturated soil mass that is loaded by a building, fill, or other engineered works. Under load
the soil compresses and voids reduce with the squeezed-out water producing the excess pore
pressure until it gradually drains away—taking the shortest possible flow path. This excess
pore pressure would show a rise of water level in a piezometer tube just as if we had poured
water into it in the case just analyzed.

Hydraulic Gradient
When a piezometer tube is inserted into the soil and the water level rises to the GWT outside
the tube we have a static case, and any flow is in the direction of the hydraulic grade line
of the GWT. When we pour water into the tube, we produce an excess pore pressure with a
higher energy level inside than outside the tube and, according to the Bernoulli principle, flow
will start from the high to the lower energy level (the GWT). This creates a vertical hydraulic
grade line that has a varying energy level until the excess pore pressure is dissipated. It is
customary to assume this line has a linear variation over the flow path, although in a real soil
only the condition of the endpoints is known. With a linear variation the hydraulic gradient
is simply
. AA
l = T
The critical hydraulic gradient ic is defined as that which reduces the effective pressure p'o
to zero and can be derived as shown on Fig. 2-9. From the equation shown it follows that,
if the saturated unit weight ySat = 19.61 kN/m3, the critical hydraulic gradient across al-m
depth L is
. = 19.61 - 9.807 _ 9.803 ^
lc " 9.807 " 9.807 "
That is, if the column of water above the top of the soil AA = 1 m, we have
AA 1 ,
lc = T = T = l
It is evident that if L = 2 m then AA = 2 m, etc. In real soils the alternative form for ic using
G5 and void ratio e in Fig. 2-9 gives a range of about 0.8 to 1.25, so for most practical cases
it is satisfactory to use ic = 1 for the critical hydraulic gradient.

Hydrostatic Uplift
When the GWT is confined beneath an impermeable stratum, for example, a gravelly sand
(the aquifer) containing water that cannot rise to the free groundwater level because of


after cancelling as shown we obtain
YwAh=y'L (1) Also: / = yw ^LZi2 (2)

using void ratios of 0.35 to 0.8, the critical hydraulic gradient is found to be around 1.0.

confinement, the A/* between the bottom of the impermeable layer and the free water sur-
face represents uplift pressure on the confining stratum. The following case will be used to
illustrate this concept:
A silty clay layer extends from the ground surface to a depth of 22 m and has an average
unit weight of 19.1 kN/m3. The confining pressure in the sandy soil containing the water table
is such that water would rise 8 m in a borehole extending into the aquifer. How deep could
an excavation proceed before there is a danger that the hydrostatic uplift pressure would lift
the remaining soil? Referring to Fig. 2-10 and neglecting any side shear, we can compute
the thickness of soil ts from a freebody analysis equating upward and downward pressures at
point A as
<Tdown = (TV = ts(l9.l) <7up = U = 8(9.807)
Equating and solving for ts, we have
8(9.807) . ,

Y = 22 - ts = 17.9 m
At this depth there is incipient uplift (termed a blow in) and site safety is in jeopardy. A safe
thickness would be more on the order of 7-8 m to allow for measurement uncertainties and
worm holes, etc., which produce weakened points where water could more readily enter the
excavation.
It is evident that very costly remedial measures might be necessary if the site exploration
program had not discovered this confined aquifer.

Two tests commonly used in the laboratory to determine k are the constant-head and
falling-head methods.5 Figure 2-11 gives the schematic diagrams and the equations used
for computing k. The falling-head test is usually used for k < 10~5 m/s (cohesive soils), and
the constant-head test is usually used for cohesionless soils.
It is often necessary to determine the field value of k since it is usually larger than the
laboratory-determined value, often by a factor of 2. An accurate6 determination of the field
k is beyond the scope of this textbook but some procedures and equipment are described by
Leroueil et al. (1988).

Flow Nets

The flow of water through soil under an energy potential can be mathematically expressed
by a Laplace equation as
d2h d2h _
kx dx2 + ky dy2 " °
where kx, ky = coefficients of permeability parallel to the x, y axes, respectively
h = energy potential

The preceding equation is for two-dimensional flow, which with appropriate axis rotation
will apply to most seepage problems. A graphical solution of this equation results in families

of intersecting orthogonal curves that are called a flow net. One set of the curves represents
equipotential lines (lines of constant piezometric head) and the other set, intersecting at right
angles, represents flow paths. The flow net consists of squares of varying dimension if kx =
ky and rectangles otherwise. In general, for reasonably homogeneous soil a graphical solution
of the Laplace equation provides seepage quantities that are at least as correct as one is likely
to measure the coefficients of permeability k{.
Seepage quantities are often required for foundation engineering work. They are needed to
determine the pumping requirements to dewater excavation sites and cofferdams. They can
be estimated from a flow net as

Q = k'H^Wt (m3 in time t) (2-27)

where k! = transformed coefficient of permeability when kx # ky and so the resulting
flow net consists of squares, k' = Jkxky in units of H and t
H = differential head of fluid across system, m
n/> n>d = numbers of flow paths and equipotential drops, respectively, in system
W = width of seepage flow, m
t = time base (1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, etc.)

Although for academic purposes considerable effort is often expended to produce neat flow
nets consisting of well-formed squares, in practice flow quantities to a precision far in excess
of the accuracy of kf can be obtained with rather crude approximations (see Fig. 2-12) as
long as the problem geometry is to scale. Great effort to refine the ratio of nf/nd above to,
say, 4.3/7.5 versus a rough value of 4/7 is simply a waste of time.
It is evident that using squares of side dimensions sXs produces a flow path of dimension
HfS and length rids. The ratio H/ridS is the hydraulic gradient used earlier. Of course, we
simply cancel s since it is with both rid and rif. As a result, we must use the hydraulic gradient
defined by a constant loss of AH across each length rids. For rid = 4, each rid value represents
a 25 percent loss of the total pressure head H across the length rids = L.
Figure 2-12a illustrates a flow net for one side of a cofferdam-type structure, which will be
of most interest in this text. We may use the flow net to estimate how much drawdown may
be allowed on the construction side of the wall or how much excavation can be performed
before the construction side becomes "quick."
For other seepage problems the user is referred to any text on soil mechanics [e.g., Bowles
(1984)].

2-10 CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES
When a soil is loaded by any new load condition (a foundation, fill, embankment, etc.), settle-
ments always occur. They may be insignificant or large enough to require special construction
procedures. These settlements are not elastic, as one would have by compressing a column of
steel or concrete, but rather are the vertical statistical accumulation of particle rolling, slid-
ing, and slipping into the void spaces together with some particle crushing (or fracturing) at
the contact points. This portion of the settlement is a state change and is largely nonrecover-
able upon any removal of load. Any elastic compression of the soil particles is a settlement
component that is recoverable upon removal of load. Because this component is usually very
small, the so-called elastic settlement7 recovery upon removal of the load is small.
As noted in the preceding section, particle displacement and void reduction can produce
a temporary excess pore pressure depending on the amount and distribution of pore water
present—very large values of Aw if the soil is saturated (S -» 100 percent) and negligible for
S -> 0 percent.
If we have a relationship between stresses and strains for the soil we can compute a stress-
strain modulus ESy also called modulus of deformation or, more commonly (but incorrectly),
the modulus of elasticity. With this modulus we can use an integration over the influence
depth L0 to compute the deformation or settlement AH as
fL° Aa (L°
AH = \ -w-dz= \ edz (2-28)
JO ^s JO
For the usual integration over a sufficiently small length L0 that the compressive stress
Aq and the stress-strain modulus Es can be taken as a constant, the preceding integration
becomes
AH = eLo (2-28a)
The stress-strain modulus Es used here is not a simple parameter to obtain for any soil, for
it varies with soil type, state, confinement, and depth. The stress increment Aq may be known
reasonably well at the foundation interface, but it decreases within the stress influence zone
in such a manner that it is difficult-to-impossible to obtain accurately. Approximations are
commonly used for both Es and Aq because of these difficulties.
When the soil contains water, a further complication arises because settlement is not com-
plete until the excess pore pressure Au dissipates (and often for some additional time beyond).
Because this involves the hydraulic conductivity k of the stratum (or strata), time may be a
significant factor.
Thus, for most soil foundations we have two problems:

1. How much settlement will occur? (The answer usually depends on whether the soil is
normally consolidated or overconsolidated.)
2. How long will it take for most of the settlement to occur?

7Elastic settlement recovery is the preferred description here since substantial base expansion often occurs in ex-
cavations made in cohesive soil deposits. This expansion, however, is not an "elastic" phenomenon but results
primarily from water absorption around the clay particles. This type of expansion is usually called heave and is
most difficult to predict or quantify.

Previous Page


For example, the settlement computed from Eq. (2-28) for LH may take three or four
years to occur. As a rather extreme example, the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in Italy) is, and
has been, settling (but not uniformly, so it leans) for over 700 years. Most time-dependent
settlements occur in the range of 3 to 10 years but engineering projects usually require that
the time-of-settlement estimate be more narrowly bracketed.
In saturated coarse-grained or nonsaturated fine-grained soils, pore drainage is nearly in-
stantaneous,8 so we can use a form of Eq. (2-28) without time being of concern. In fine-
grained saturated soils time is a concern, so we need to obtain both an estimate for A// and
a time parameter.
The settlements for waste disposal ponds and dredged fills are usually very large (some-
times 5O+ percent of original thickness). These are usually called "consolidation" settlements,
and both the amount and time duration are of considerable importance. That type of consoli-
dation is considered briefly in Sec. 2-10.5.
The consolidation theory presented in the rest of this section applies reasonably well to
fully saturated soils and to those cases where the settlement AH is not large relative to the
mass thickness.

2-10.1 Elements of Consolidation Theory
It is assumed that the reader has been exposed to some of the basic elements of consolidation
theory; however, as a convenience, select elements are included here. The following assump-
tions are essential for the general development of the consolidation theory as first given by
Terzaghi ca. the mid-1920s.

1. Soil in the consolidating layer is homogenous.
2. Soil is completely saturated (S = 100%).
3. Compressibility of either water or soil grains is negligible.
4. Strains are infinitesimal. An element of dimensions dx, dy, and dz has the same response
as one with dimensions JC, y, and z.
5. Flow is one-dimensional.
6. Compression is one-dimensional.
7. Darcy's law is valid (v = ki).
8. Soil properties are constants.
9. The void ratio e vs. pressure p response is linear.

Of these, assumptions 8 and 9 are the most serious; however, number 4 can be of con-
sequence. The total laboratory strain using a 20-mm thick test sample may approach e =
AH/H = 0.5, whereas the field strain may be nearly infinitesimal for a 2- to 3-m thick con-
solidating layer.

8Drainage may not be nearly instantaneous for fine-grained nonsaturated soils, depending on the degree of satura-
tion. However, if S is not known there is no theory that can do more than estimate pore-pressure dissipation.


The basic expression for three-dimensional (3-D) flow volume V in a saturated earth mass

is

/ d2h , d2h , d2h\ , . , dV
[k*Jx2- + k>W+kz^)dXdydZ=^
This expression depends on assumptions 1-4 and 7. For 1-D flow (in the z or vertical direc-
tion) the first two terms drop out. If for convenience we use k = &z, we have the volumetric
flow defined as
k^dxdydz = w (229)
The element volume is dx dy dz and the pore volume is (dx dy dz)[e/(l + e)]. AU volume
changes V are pore volume changes from assumption 3, so we can write the time rate of
volume change as

Since (dx dy dz)/(l + e) is the constant volume of solids, we can rewrite Eq. (2-29a) as
[{dx dy dz)/(l + e)](de/di). Equating this to Eq. (2-29) and canceling dx, dy, and dz, we obtain
to = 1 Se
dz2 1 + e dt
Only a pressure head u in excess of the hydrostatic head will cause flow (and volume
change); and since h = Aw/yw we can rewrite Eq. (2-2%) as

Let us also define the coefficient of volume compressibility mv (and introducing the initial
in situ void ratio eo for e) as

mv = - ^ - = a'v (2-34)

The reciprocal of mv has the units of stress-strain modulus (kPa or MPa). It is often referred
to as the constrained modulus and is the Es of Eq. (2-28). We can rewrite cv in a form suitable
for finite element analysis as
fc(l + eo) k
cv = = (2-35)

We can also write Eq. (2-32) as

r ^ - dU (2 K)
The solution of Eq. (2-36) is not trivial and uses a Taylor series expansion. Without going
into the several details that can be found in Taylor (1948) and Holtz and Kovacs (1981,
Appendix B2) it is as follows:
" v / l fM .nirz.\(.mrz\ (n2ir2cvt\ .. „ .

tum of depth or thickness z = 2H and with z measured from the upper surface of the stratum

solidation cv is constant and time Hs a multiple of cvH, we can introduce a dimensionless
time factor T defined as
Tt = C-£ (2-38)
It is convenient to let n = (2m + 1), where m = integer 0, 1, 2, 3 , . . . , and to define
M = J(2m + 1)
With these parameters one can rewrite Eq. (2-37) to read

Although Eq. (2-39) gives the pore pressure at various depth ratios z/H, it is preferable in
most cases to estimate the average amount of consolidation that has taken place after some
elapsed time. Finite-element programs usually obtain the average amount of consolidation
Ui after some elapsed time, as in the following equation:

The initial and current pore-pressure profiles are obtained using numerical integration (such
as average end area, trapezoidal rule, Simpson's \ rule, etc.). Equation (2-39) can be inte-
grated for select cases to obtain t// = 1 — UJu0 where / = some elapsed time after the initial
application of pressure that produces the initial pore-pressure profile uo. For the special case

A number of approximations for Eq. (2-40) were made to simplify computations prior to
wide availability of personal computers. Equation (2-40) seldom requires over three values
of m (0, 1, and 2 except for very small values of U). The approximations are useful in order
to obtain specific values of either T or U. Among the most widely used are those given by
Fox (1948a) as follows:


These equations are useful alternatives to programming Eq. (2-40). They can be used to
extend the range of Table 2-4 for certain operations.

2-10.2 The One-Dimensional Consolidation Test
A one-dimensional (1-D) consolidation test9 is widely used to obtain the settlement and
time parameters. Al-D test confines the soil laterally in a metal ring so that settlement and
drainage can occur only in the vertical direction. These conditions are reasonably close to
what occurs in situ for most loading cases. Actually some radial displacement and lateral
drainage probably occur but, based on experience, these appear to be small enough that a
1-D analysis gives adequate accuracy in most cases.
There is some opinion that field consolidation is sufficiently three-dimensional that a
1-D analysis is inadequate, prompting some researchers to propose theories (or computa-
tional models) to attempt to solve this case. The three-dimensional finite-element model
(FEM) is sometimes used. The 3-D FEM method, however, has several disadvantages: First,
it requires substantial computer resources; it requires estimating the stress-strain modulus Es
and Poisson's ratio /JL and, when time is involved, the coefficient of permeability k[ for the
three directions (kX9 ky, kz). Second, interpretation of the output is difficult, as is assessing
the accuracy. There are, of course, occasions where a client may be willing to pay the extra
expense of a 3-D analysis, or it may be required for the uniqueness of the project. A 3-D
consolidation may occur where a series of spread footings (or a mat) overlies a very thick
consolidating layer with lateral dimensions much larger than the loaded area(s).
Terzaghi's general consolidation theory is based heavily on the premise that the soil is satu-
rated. A number of persons have attempted to develop a suitable theory both for 3-dimensional
consolidation and for the general case, in which the soil may be either saturated or only par-
tially saturated. The most recent attempt known to the author is that of Tekinsoy and Haktanir
(1990), who give a differential equation. Their solution, however, requires estimation of sev-
eral critical parameters, so there is little to recommend it.
In most cases, the 1-D consolidation test is suitable and is certainly the most economical
and, compared to 3-D FEM models, it is better understood. This test is reasonably simple and
has a large experience base, having been widely used since it was first developed by Terzaghi
in the mid-1920s [see state-of-art report by Olson (1986)].
The 1-D test is used to obtain a compression parameter for the amount of settlement
and the consolidation parameter cv for the settlement rate estimate. The preconsolidation
pressure p'c and thus the OCR can also be determined from this test.
The test is performed on an "undisturbed" soil sample10 that is placed in a consolidation
ring available in diameters ranging from 45 to 115 mm. The sample height is between 20
and 30 mm; 20 mm is the most commonly used thickness to reduce test time. The larger-
diameter samples give better parameters, since the amount of disturbance (recovery, trim-
ming, insertion into the test ring, etc.) is about the same for any size of sample, with the

9This test is described in most laboratory test manuals and in specific detail in ASTM as test D 2435 or in Bowles
(1992). It is also sometimes called an oedeometer test.
10There is no such thing as an "undisturbed" soil sample. In geotechnical work "undisturbed" means a sample
where care has been taken to minimize sample damage.


relative effects less for the larger samples. The most common test ring diameter is 64 mm,
since this best balances the costs of sample recovery and disturbance effects. Tube diameters
larger than 76 mm may result in a premium charge for the sample, particularly if a larger
borehole must be made.
The consolidation test proceeds by applying a series of load increments (usually in the ratio
of Ap/p = 1 in a pressure range from about 25 to either 1600 or 3200 kPa) to the sample
and recording sample deformation by using either an electronic displacement device or a dial
gauge at selected time intervals.
Sometimes the Ap/p ratio is reduced to 0.5 or less in the region of the current overburden
pressure po to attempt to better define the transition zone between preyield and postyield
stresses in the test sample.

Controlled rate of strain (CRS) consolidation test. The standard consolidation test is a
controlled stress test (CST), since a constant load increment is used for each stage of the test.
A modified version of the test that applies the load through a controlled rate of strain (CRS)
has been standardized as ASTM D 4186. Silvestri et al. (1985) give a comparison of the
CRS and the CST on a sensitive Canadian clay and claim that the CRS may have some ad-
vantage over the CST for certain clays. In this test, special equipment is used that can apply
a very slow strain rate to develop the consolidation load. The consolidation ring has porous
stones on both sample faces so that pore pressure at the sample base can be measured if re-
quired. The load is applied as a constant strain [on the order of about 20 percent total and
a rate de/dt = 1 X 10~7(s~1)] but at a rate such that the excess pore pressure (measured at
the sample base) is kept in a range of from 3 to 30 percent of the loading pressure devel-
oped by that strain rate. The results are plotted as strain e vs. log/7 (i.e., take displacement
strain accumulations e and pressure readings—with monitoring of the base pore pressure so
that strain rate can be adjusted—at select time intervals similar to the CST). Proponents of
this test claim that, for sensitive soils or where the soil would produce an e vs. log p curve
similar to Fig. 2-17&, the CRS provides a better estimate of the preconsolidation pressure
p'c and a somewhat higher compression index. Inspection of Fig. 2AIb indicates that test
results will be subject to considerable personal interpretation, since a plot of e vs. log p is
very nearly identical to a plot of e vs. log p. Because of the special equipment required and
the problem of interpretation of the data plot, the CRS is not as widely used (as of 1995) as
its proponents would like and will not be considered further in this text.
Sufficient laboratory data should be obtained to allow computation of the natural (or in
situ) water content WN and the specific gravity G5 so that the initial void ratio eo and the void
ratio ei at the end of any load increment can be computed.
With these data there are several ways one can obtain t\ values that are used to compute the
coefficient of consolidation cv given by Eq. (2-38), which can be rearranged to cv = TiH2/tt.
This textbook will describe five of them.

The Original Casagrande Method (Method 1)
This method was developed by Casagrande [see Taylor (1948), p. 241] in the early 1930s and
utilizes a semilog plot of sample compression S vs. time.11 In using the Casagrande Method,

11 The method is sometimes called the Logarithm of Time Fitting Method.

the difference between any two dial readings X dial sensitivity (here 0.001 mm/div) is AH. If you directly read AH, plot that instead of dial readings.

time-deformation data are plotted on a semilogarithmic plot as illustrated in Fig. 2-13a. This
type of plot is based on the similarity between a semilog plot of displacement versus log t
and a semilog plot of U versus log T values shown in Table 2-4 (Case I or Ia). This semilog
plot gives an identifiable 3-branch curve: (1) an initial parabolic curved part [see equation
in Table 2-4 (T « TTU2/4 for U < 0.60)]; (2) a midpart that is relatively straight, and (3) a
curved part for the end12 portion. If tangents are drawn on the mid and end two branches
(or parts), their intersection is at approximately log T = 1, which represents a state of 100
percent consolidation.
It has been found that at least some consolidation tests plot a S versus log / curve with a
shape very similar to the U versus T plot. When this is the case13 one should be able to plot
the laboratory S versus log t curve and obtain the S displacement at 100 percent consolidation
(i.e., U = 100 or 1.0). We obtain this displacement by projecting from the intersection to the
displacement axis (see Fig. 2-13«). We will call this displacement Dioo- The Z)10O theoreti-
cally occurs when excess pore pressure Aw developed under that load increment becomes 0.
Practically, Au may only —> 0 as a result of time limitations for the test and the procedure
used to obtain Dioo graphically. A poor Dioo value can also be obtained if the 8 versus log p
plot does not have a readily identifiable three-branch or S shape.
The next needed data item is the apparent initial displacement14 of the sample, which we
will call Do. With these two values it is a trivial task to compute the displacement at any time
of interest.
Since one cannot plot log t = 0(log0 = — <»), it is necessary to resort to the characteristics
of the semilog plot of a parabola. If the initial shape is not approximately parabolic on the
semilog plot, you should either use a different method (of the five given here) or simply take
D0 as the initial displacement reading at the start of the load increment at t = 0. If the initial
shape is parabolic, use the following sequence to obtain the Do estimate:

1. Select a time t\ in the parabolic portion of the plot.
2. Select a second time ^ = 4f i, also in the parabolic part.
3. Obtain the vertical distance (or reading) between t\ and ti-
4. Plot this vertical distance above t\ to obtain DQ. If possible one should repeat these steps
for other t\ values and put an "average" horizontal line through the points for a "best" Do.

The time t( at some deformation D1- is obtained from the Do and Dioo deformation values.
That Dt value is projected to the settlement curve to obtain t{ from the time axis. The ^o value
occurs at the D50 = (Dioo + £>5o)/2 point projected to the time versus settlement curve.
This value is the one most commonly used but others such as D60, D30,... can be used.
Whatever value is used, it should be one for which there is a T value in Table 2-4 (unless you

12Table 2-4 shows T only up to 0.848. Thus, it is necessary to use the equation shown in the table and compute
additional points between U = .90 and U — 1.00 (or 100 percent—table uses percentages). Alternatively, use the
computer program UFACTOR on your diskette for sufficient data to plot a reasonably accurate curve.
13If the 8 versus log/? is not S-shaped, you can enlarge the vertical 8 scale and do the best you can. Preferably you
should use one of the alternative procedures and possibly average the two time values for your "best estimate."
14It is usual to plot dial gauge readings versus log time; however, the actual displacements are plotted if electronic
displacement equipment (usually a Linear Voltage Displacement Transducer, or LVDT) is used.


increase the table range). In considering the precision of this method, the value range given
in Table 2-4 is probably adequate.

Taylor's J Time Method (Method 2)
An alternative method to obtain t\ is to plot deformation versus Jt with time on the abscissa
[see Taylor (1948)] as in Fig. 2-13fc. This method uses the fact that if one plots the Table 2-4
values (again, Case I) using U on the ordinate versus Jf on the abscissa, the resulting curve
has a straight initial portion and a curved end portion. Locate the 90 percent value of Table
2-4 on this curve at the Vo.848 = 0.921 plotted point. Now draw a straight line from U = O
through the linear part of the plot and continue to the Jf axis (abscissa). Now draw a second
straight line from U = O through the 90 percent point previously located on the U versus Jf
plot and continue it to the abscissa. It is found that the latter line will have an intercept on the
abscissa that is approximately 15 percent larger than the initial line.
Based on this observation, Taylor (1948) suggested that since many of the actual laboratory
S versus log t curves resembled Case I of Table 2-4, a similar analogy should exist between
a plot of U versus Jf and the actual S versus Jt. The steps in the Taylor method are these:

1. Take deformation and time readings as with the Casagrande Method. As these are taken,
begin a_plot of 8 (or dial reading) versus Jt; i.e., if elapsed time = 16 min, you would
plot Jl6 = 4.0 versus whatever the displacement is at time = 16 min (see Fig. 2-136).
2. Continue this plot until enough data are obtained to estimate the straight line reasonably
(probably four to six points). Now draw the straight line through the best average of the
points and project to both axes. Again, if this part of the curve does not exhibit any linearity,
do the best you can or else use one of the other methods given.
3. Obtain DQ as the intersection of the straight line and the S axis. Also obtain the intersection
on the abscissa and multiply the abscissa reading by 1.15 (i.e., if the intercept is 2.5,
calculate 2.5 X 1.15 = 2.875). Locate the point (here it would be at 2.875 on the abscissa).
Now from the Do point draw a second straight line to intercept this point.
4. Continue taking deformation time readings and plotting the results. When the actual curve
of S versus Jt intersects the 1.15 line, that point projected horizontally to the S axis is the
Dgo reading.
5. With the Do and D90 values you can now obtain any u value of interest such as £50, ^90,
etc. Remember the time values from this plot are Jt values and must be squared (i.e., if
you find Jtso = 5.0, the actual £50 = 52 = 25 min).
6. It is usual to stop taking S versus t data once the laboratory curve is beyond the tgo loca-
tion, add the next pressure increment, and continue the test. These steps are repeated as
necessary until all of the pressure increments have been applied.

It has been found that, although theoretically any f,- value (say, Z50) should be the same
using the Casagrande semilog fitting and Taylor Jt methods, in practice the Jt method usu-
ally gives smaller values, often less than one-half the ^o obtained from a semilog plot. As
a result, smaller cv values are computed using the Jt value of t*&. A possible explanation
is that the semilog plot includes some secondary compression time whereas the t90 obtained
from the Jt plot may be more realistic.

haran and Prakash (1985).] Theoretical plot of T vs. T/U. Note the slight differences between values given in

The Rectangular Hyperbola Method (Method 3)
This method has been suggested by Sridharan and Rao (1981) and Sridharan and Prakash
(1985). The method involves (see also Sec. 2-10.4) the following:

1. From a normalized plot of T/U versus T (both arithmetic scales) obtain the slope of a
curve through the origin and to selected points on the linear part of the normalized plot
(see Fig. 2-14a). The linear part of the plot lies in the region of 60 < U ^ 9O+ percent.
You should make a plot and check the values given on Fig. 2-14«, which was plotted by
the author.
Also measure the slope of the straight line between U = 60 and 90 percent. The ref-
erences coauthored by Sridharan give this slope in an equation (from using U in percent,

where the author used U as a decimal) as
T/U = M + C = 0.0082087 + 0.00244
From this we have M = 0.0082087 and C = 0.00244. The constant C is the intercept
of the straight line part of the plot extended back to intercept the ordinate.
If you do not obtain equivalent values from your plot, you may need to adjust the A and
B values given in the text and taken from the reference cited.
2. On the plot from step 1, draw a line from the origin to the point on Fig. 2-14a repre-
sented by U = 60 percent, computed as follows: U = 60 percent; T = 0.287; T/U =
0.287/0.60 = 0.48. Plot 0.48 on the ordinate versus 0.287 on the abscissa and label the
point as U = 60 percent. Measure the slope of M\; then, from the origin to U = 90 per-
cent obtain a slope M2. Compare these values to those of the author, 1.88 versus 2.038
and 1.31 versus 1.35. If your values are intermediate, use an average of the three values.
If they are close to the reference, use the reference values; and if close to the author's, use
an average of your values and the author's.
3. Now plot your normalized 8 versus time data in the form of t/S versus t (equal time inter-
vals are suggested—perhaps every 5 or 1O+ minutes). As soon as the plot displays a linear
part, measure the slope as m and the intercept on the ordinate as c. Refer to Fig. 2-14& and
note on that plot with furnished data how the plot is "folded."

4. By analogy we have

T/U MT + C
t/8 mt + c
From this consideration and the previous observation that a straight line from the origin
to U = 60 percent had a slope M\ = 2.038M (or your value) and to U = 90 percent had
a slope of M2 = 1.35M, it follows that the slopes from the origin of the laboratory t/8
versus t curve should have those slopes as well. Using this concept with the origin as the
starting point, one can say
t/8 = Amt
Here A is a function of the degree of consolidation U9 which can be readily computed.
Several are listed here:

U9 % A B
60 2.038* 0.2972

For intermediate values in this table either compute or make a plot. From t/8 = mt + c
and t/8 = Amt, one can obtain
_ c
1 " m{A - 1)
In this equation, t = t^o, tjo,..., etc., depending on the value of A used. For example,
from a t/8 versus t plot obtain m = 0.0015 and c = 0.030 (t/8 in min/mm). Then obtain

For ?70 you would use A = 1.873, and so on.
Special note: If the t/8 versus t curve exhibits more than one straight line part, use the
first linear part for these computations.
5. You can also compute the coefficient of consolidation, previously defined as cv = TH1ItI,
by substitution for t( from the previous step to obtain cv = TH2(A — X)m/c. Let B =

Since cv = constant, any U can be used. Note from the table that B = constant.
6. You can do an axis shift as described in Sec. 2-10.5.


The Velocity Method (Method 4)
This method [Parkin (1978); Lun and Parkin (1985)] consists basically of the following steps:

1. Plot a curve of consolidation rate log U versus log time factor T with U on the ordinate
(see Fig. 2-15) on a sheet of 216 X 280 mm tracing paper laid over a similar size sheet
of 3 X 3 cycle log-log paper. The consolidation rate U is the derivative of U, but one can
approximate it by two branches as

U = —== T « 0.197 (U < 50%; see equations on Table 2-4)
JTTT
U = 2e~{7T2m T > 0.197 (U > 50%)
This plot has an initial slope of approximately 1:2 up to about U = 50 percent (slope
defined by two log cycles horizontal and one log cycle vertical), and then the slope in-
creases continuously toward o°. Make a heavy vertical line on the plot at the point T = I
(corresponding to U = 100 percent). Parkin scaled this plot by dividing the U values by
10 so that the resulting ordinate values are closer to the 8/t values of the following step,
but this is not necessary.
2. From your 8 versus t data compute 8/t and make a similar plot using log 8/t on the ordinate
versus log t and three-cycle log-log paper. There should be an initial straight line part in
this plot that is also 1:2. If the plot is not overly distorted, you should arbitrarily make
this slope 1:2 after plotting enough points to verify that it will be reasonably close. Now
superimpose the tracing (step 1) onto this plot (use a light table, a lighted window, or
darker lines if you have difficulty seeing the lower plot).
You may have to do some curve fitting here. First, align the 1:2 slopes, compare the
theoretical and laboratory curves, and try to obtain a best fit. In doing this step you may
shift the tracing horizontally (but be careful not to rotate the axes) to obtain a best fit over
as much of the two curves as possible. When your best fit is obtained, read through the
tracing at T = 1 to the time scale on the abscissa of the lower (8/t) plot to obtain t\oo-

If H= 18 mm (two-way drainage) and fioo = 15 min (obtained from Fig. 2-15a,b),
the coefficient of consolidation is obtained as follows: Compute H = 18/2 = 9 mm =
0.009 m; T = 1. Use the preceding equation to solve for cv:
cv = [l(0.0092)/15] X 1440 = 0.0078 mVday
The 1440 is used to convert m2/min to m2/day.

The Finite-Element Method (Method 5)
The finite-element method (FEM) requires a computer program. The general methodology
for 1-D consolidation is given in Desai (1979). The author's program FEMCONSL utilizes

this method, which is integrated into program SMSETTLE (see the README.DOC file on
your diskette).
Basically the FEM requires that the user subdivide the stratum or strata (including inter-
mediate sand layers) where consolidation settlements will occur into at least two elements.
This step yields at least a top, a midheight, and a bottom node point so that one can plot the
layer pore-pressure distribution profile if desired.
For each stratum (including sandwiched sand layers) the coefficient of permeability (or
hydraulic conductivity) kv in the vertical direction must be input along with the coefficient of
volume compressibility mv (given in the previous section). Since hydraulic conductivity is a
time-dependent parameter, the user must select some time intervals, usually starting with 1
day, then perhaps 7, 10, 100,..., n days as input data.

laterally until a best fit is obtained over as much of the curve as possible, and then read Ji00 where the T = 1
ordinate intersects the abscissa on the test curve.

One must also estimate an initial pore-pressure distribution in the consolidating strata. One
might use a method given in Chap. 5 to obtain the stress at each vertical node caused by the
foundation loading. Another option is to use the pressure produced by the vertical load on the
uppermost node as a constant pressure for the consolidation depth. Other similar options are
available.
On the basis of the pressure profile used and the time increments, together with the input kv
and mv, the program computes for each time value a pressure profile, the percent consolidation
U (using the numerical integration method), and a time factor T. Several trial sets of time
values may be required before a suitable data set is obtained. The output for each trial is the
percent consolidation U and a pressure profile and time factor r,- for each of the input times.
The last output values should represent the time for, say, U = 90 to 95 percent consolidation
to have taken place. If the largest U value for the trial is only 70 or 80 percent, you would
certainly want to make another trial with some of the later times increased.

Which of These Several Methods Should One Use?
If secondary compression is to be estimated, the semilog plot method must be used with
sufficient 8 versus time data recorded so that the end branch of the one or more curves from
pressure increments closest to the design value can be plotted with an identifiable slope. This
will enable you to compute a secondary compression index even though there might not be a
well-identified ^ioo value for when it begins.
For the usual computation of cv and with these five methods available, which one should
be used?
a. Methods 1 and 2 are most widely used.
b. Some users prefer Method 2 (\htj~t method) since it is often somewhat faster (i.e., change
pressure increments as soon as the plot has passed the D90 point).
c. Method 3 will be almost as fast as Method 2 since you can stop data collection for that
pressure increment as soon as a linear plot region is obtained.
d. All but the FEM depend upon the assumption that the measured 8 versus time curve is
similar to the U versus T curve.
e. Method 5 is suggested when several strata contribute to the total consolidation, since this
method tends to couple stratum effects somewhat, where Eq. (2-38) considers each stratum
separately. Coupling is also necessary if there are sand layers interspersed between clay
layers.
/ You might also consider using Methods 3 and 4 where Methods 1 and/or 2 do not seem to
provide readily identifiable t{ values and if an enlarged vertical scale using Method 1 does
not give any apparent improvement in results.
g. Use the method that has the greatest local acceptance.

2-10.3 The Compression Index and Ratio
The amount of primary consolidation settlement is computed using either the compression
index Cc obtained from a plot of void ratio e versus log pressure (Fig. 2-16a) or from a
compression ratio C'c obtained from a plot of strain e versus log pressure as on Fig. 2-\6b.
The void ratio or strain is computed based on initial sample conditions and the compression
A// under the current load increment to D\QO.
Some persons have used the total compression under the load increment to compute the
current void ratio or strain, but current practice favors using only the sample A// from DQ
to DiQQ. This latter value computes a slightly larger (and more conservative) value for the
compression index Cc or ratio C'c.
The plot of e versus log p is more rapid than using e versus log p. Because the strain e is
based on the initial sample height Ht and the accumulated compression X A/f to the D100
value of the current load increment, the plot can proceed with the test (e = X A//////). The e
versus log p plot requires considerably more computations, some of which can only be done
at the completion of the test, but (until recently) it has been more used.
The initial branch of the e or e versus log p plot represents recompression of the sample
back to the in situ state from the expansion that occurred during recovery (refer also to Figs.
2-16 and 2-17). This is also called the preyield stress range. The approximately linear curve
portion beyond the in situ state is called the postyield stress range.


The discontinuity between the pre- and postyield curve branches represents the previ-
ously consolidated stress state (or previous stress history imprint). The discontinuity is seldom
abrupt but usually transitions along a curve that is a characteristic of that particular soil under
the test procedure(s) being used. Experience on both "undisturbed" and remolded samples of
the same soil, and using loading and unloading curve parts, gives the following:

1. If the discontinuity occurs at approximately the current in situ overburden pressure p'o,
the soil is normally consolidated.
2. If the discontinuity occurs at a pressure p'c greater than the existing overburden pressure,
the soil is overconsolidated and the OCR = p'c/p'o > 1.
3. If the discontinuity occurs at a pressure p'c less than p'o, the soil is probably recently (on a
geologic scale) deposited and may still be undergoing consolidation.
4. When preconsolidation and existing overburden pressures are within about ±10 percent of
each other you will have to make a subjective determination of the preconsolidation state
{under-, normally, or overconsolidated). Base the determination on experience, sample
quality, test procedure, and any other helpful information that might apply.
5. The remolded soil consolidation curve is always below the "undisturbed" soil curve, as
shown by the labeled, dashed line on Fig. 2-17a. This observation, together with the tran-
sition back to the "virgin" curve at the point where an unload curve branch is done, is the
basis for defining Cr and locating the preconsolidation pressure pfc.

If the soil is preconsolidated, that slope between current p'o and p'c, drawn by eye as a best
fit since it is usually curved, is designated the recompression index Cr or recompression ratio
Cr. You may get some guidance for this slope if you do a rebound and reload curve branch
as in Fig. 2-17a. For computing Cr with rebound data sometimes the average of the initial
recompression branch and the reload branch is used.
At the end of primary consolidation for the current load increment—usually taken as 24
hr—the dial gauge (or displacement device) reading for settlement measurement should have
not changed appreciably for a considerable (range of 2 to 6 hr) period of time. We say this
state represents the end of primary consolidation when the excess pore pressure Aw in the
sample is zero, or very nearly so, and we are somewhat into secondary compression (to be
considered later). The value of D\oo described in the previous section is arbitrarily taken as
the primary settlement and the corresponding time when it occurs is t\oo.
It should be evident that all stresses involved here are effective stresses. In situ we have
K0 conditions, and in the laboratory by definition the excess pore pressure Aw is zero when
we complete the data for any given load increment on the sample. At this pore-pressure state
the soil grain contact points carry the applied stress, and by definition this is the effective
pressure state.
The transition point between pre- and postyield may be a gradual curve, a well-defined one,
or a sharp break. There are several methods available to obtain this transition as a "point" so
that the preconsolidation pressure p'c defined by this point can be compared with the current
in situ overburden pressure p'o to ascertain whether the soil is preconsolidated (OCR =
PM > I)-

Method 1: By Eye
We may identify the transition as a most probable value by eye, which is a rather common
practice, particularly with some experience (see Fig. 2-16Z? and Example 5-12). The shape
of the discontinuous (curved region) portion of the curve is used as a guide.

Method 2: Using Casagrande's Method
Casagrande15 (1936) proposed a procedure as shown on Fig. 2- 16a to determine p'c. Steps in
the "Casagrande Method" are as follows:

stated he had never used this method himself.

verify that e = X(^H1)ZH1 = X(H1)ZlO = Z(AeV(I + eo) = S(Ae)/(l + 1-008).

1. Determine by eye the sharpest curvature in the transition zone and draw a tangent.
2. Draw a horizontal line through this tangent point and bisect the angle a thus produced.
3. Extend the "straight line" or virgin slope of the e or e versus log p curve to intersect the
bisector of step 2.
4. Take the intersection of step 3 as the preconsolidation pressure p'c. Remember the e or
6 versus log p is an "effective" stress plot since the load at Dioo is fully carried by the
grain-to-grain contact pressure.

The value of p'c (see Fig. 2-16) from the curve is then compared to the existing overburden
effective pressure p'o to see if OCR > 1.

Method 3: The Method of Work
There are cases where the e versus log p plot has a large, gently curved region as illustrated in
Fig. 2-18 so that the "Casagrande Method" for finding the preconsolidation pressure cannot be

applied with much confidence. The curved plot of Fig. 2-18 can also occur when consolidation
tests are done using a load ratio Ap//? < 1. When this occurs you should first estimate the in
situ effective pressure p'o and note where it falls on the plot.
If this point does not appear reasonable you might use a method of work given by Becker
et al. (1987) based on the work input in the test.16 The basic methodology is as follows:
1. The work input is W = { (a\ de\ + a2 de2 + cr3 de3) where e and a are the strain and
stress in the direction subscripted. We will take the subscript 1 as the vertical direction.
2. In a consolidation test we have the following:
a. There are no €2 or 63 strains because of the ring confinement, and,
b. Since the vertical strain e 1 is nonlinear, one cannot easily integrate J o-\de\, but instead
one can use finite increments (that is, replace de\ with A increments and replace the
integral/ with aX-

16TMs method was criticized by Morin (1988) as being incorrect; however, his "correct" method gives differences
so small that they are well within method accuracy. The method was also criticized by Li (1989) as being influenced
by the scale of the plot.

Figure 2-18 A consolidation test where the full e versus log p plot is curved so that the Casagrande method to
obtain p'c is not very reliable. Note some additional points were inserted after the initial plot and curve were drawn.
These points are useful in the methods of work (Fig. 2-19) and the log-log plot of Fig. 2-20. The e and p data for
the above are given on Fig. 2-19.

These conditions yield the following equation:
AW1- = [^i±i](6,+ 1 -e,-) (2-41)
We can interpret the [ ] term as the average stress on the sample for any two loads. The
( ) term is the difference in strain between the same two loads used for the [ ]. The work
AW/ is the product of cr X e, and the cumulative work is computed as X(AW/). This is
plotted on the ordinate of an arithmetic plot of X W versus a = p. The vertical stress p
is the value at the end of the relevant load increment (the crI+i stress). The plot is done
using arithmetic scales. Because of the limitations of the standard (216 X 280 mm) graph
sheet, do the following:

L Make a plot that uses most of the page with minimal points plotted for small values of
work. From the end region where the work values are larger, make your best estimate
of the straight line end portion (see Fig. 2-19a). Select about three points arbitrarily
(as points 1, 2, and 3 on Fig. 2-19a) along this straight line and record their values.
ii. Make a smaller insert (see Fig. 2-l9b) where you can expand the vertical scale some-
what (but not excessively). Plot the two or three points from step 1 and draw a straight
line through them. Call this line BC. Next plot the several accumulated work values
in the low region and draw a best-fit straight line (OA) through them as well, and in-
tersecting with line BC. Take the intersection as the preconsolidation pressure p'c and
compare the value at the intersection to p'o and compute the OCR.

(a) Initial plot from curve of Fig. 2-18


This procedure has been used [see, for example, Crawford and Campanella (1991)] with
reasonable results. Note, however, that this method implies that the e or e versus log p curve
can be plotted using two straight lines—one from the start of the test to the yield point defined
by the location of the p'c point and the other the postyield line from this point to the end of the
test. As a final cautionary note, do not use too large a scale enlargement in the preyield region.
Because the initial part of the curve is usually curved, trying to obtain the preconsolidation
pressure p'c will not be very accurate. When using this procedure, be sure to refer to an e
versus log p plot so that you do not produce an intersection that is well into the postyield
region. Rarely can the pre- and postyield lines be drawn through the exact points, so some
judgment must be used to obtain these two straight lines and their intersection. Typical work
computations using the data on Fig. 2-19 follow:

From 0 to 10 kPa:

eo = 0.936 et = 0.933
Ae = 0.936 - 0.933 = 0.003

These computations can be done using the program WORK on your diskette.

Method 4: The Log-Log Method
This alternative method might also be used when the e or e versus log p curve does not have a
clearly defined transition point. The method was proposed by Jose et al. (1989) and Sridharan
et al. (1991) and is essentially as follows:

a. Collect the 1 -D consolidation test data and compute for each load increment the void ratio e.
b. Use a computer plotting program and construct a four-cycle log plot along the abscissa of
a sheet of paper.


Log pressure, P, kPa
Figure 2-20 The log-log method to estimate the preconsolidation pressure p'c. The e and p data to generate
this plot are in the table on Fig. 2-19. A computer program was used to generate the log-log scales, but minor
subdivisions on the log e axis were completed by hand. [After Sridharan et al. (1991).]

c. If the plotting program has the facility to plot an enlarged log scale on the ordinate of this
graph sheet similar to that in Fig. 2-20, do so. If the plotting program cannot produce such
an enlarged scale you may use a sheet of one-cycle log-log paper to transfer a suitable log
scale to the ordinate of the graph paper.17 Make several copies for future use.
d. Now plot log e versus log p and draw straight lines as a best fit in both the pre- and
postyield regions as illustrated in Fig. 2-20 (using the data on Fig. 2-19). Their intersec-
tion is the preconsolidation pressure p'c. Using remolded laboratory samples, both aged
and young, that had been preconsolidated to known values, the authors of this procedure
claim that it gave the most nearly correct p'c of any of the four methods given here.

What Is the Correct Value of p'c for General Design Use?
The text has presented a set of consolidation test data and used four methods to obtain p'c as
follows:

By eye —
Casagrande (Fig. 2-18) 120 kPa
Method of work (Fig. 2-19) 168 kPa
Log-log method (Fig. 2-20) 150 kPa

17The transfer procedure is found in most elementary engineering drawing/drafting textbooks. Tape one corner of
the scale to the control point on your graph and fix the other end at an angle to the ordinate. Use a pair of triangles
and align a point on the scale to your ordinate and proceed to place control marks on the ordinate. Use a straight
edge to complete the ordinate grid.

Log void ratio, e


The author would probably use 150 kPa. Interestingly, the average of the three methods is 146
(which was used as a guide in "recommending" the use of p'c = 150 kPa). The Casagrande
Method commonly gives somewhat low values. You should routinely verify the Casagrande
Method by use of at least one of the other methods. The log-log method is trivial if you have
suitable log-log paper, and the work method is trivial if you have a short computer program.

2-10.4 Computation of the Settlement Indexes and Settlements
The settlement indexes are computed from the slope of the void ratio or strain versus log p
curve along the virgin (or postyield) branch (see Fig. 2-16a or b) as

l0g/?2/Pl l0g/?2/Pl
The recompression indexes Cr, C'r are computed similarly but for the branch between p'o
and p'c. It is common, where possible, to extend the virgin slope to intercept one log cycle so
that log P2/P1 = log 10 = 1 to simplify computations.
During the initial development and verification of the consolidation theory, it was found
that a completely remolded sample produced a curve that always falls beneath an "undis-
turbed" sample, as qualitatively shown on Fig. 2-17a. It was also noted that soils with an
unstable structure (often with WN > Wi) may exhibit behavior as in Fig. 2-17Z? where, be-
yond the current in situ load, the soil structure collapses. This latter soil requires considerable
engineering judgment in making any settlement estimate. It is possible, however, to make an
improvement in the compression index Cc or ratio C'c for the soils shown in Figs. 2-16a and
2-17a using a method proposed by Schmertmann (1955), who analyzed a large number of
consolidation tests to develop the following procedure:

1. Extend the straight line portion of the end branch until it intersects the void ratio abscissa
at about 0.4 (this is about the minimum void ratio for most real soils—see point M of
Fig. 2-17a). Use the equivalent strain location with an e versus log/? plot.
2. In some manner obtain the initial void ratio e0 of the in situ soil. The rebound (or swell)
value is too high, but you can probably get a fair estimate using Gs and w^ (compute
to — WNGS). This estimate assumes the in situ soil is saturated.
3. In some manner determine the in situ effective overburden pressure p'o. Refer to Section
2-9 and Fig. 2-8 for typical computations. You may have to estimate some or all of the soil
unit weights.
4. At the intersection of p'o and eo (Fig. 2-16a) extend a straight line to intersect the point M
located in step 1.
5. The slope of the line drawn in step 4 is the corrected value of Cc for a normally consolidated
clay.
For a preconsolidated soil one may estimate a corrected Cc as follows:
1-3. These are the same as for a normally consolidated clay.
4. At the intersection of p'o and eo draw a line NO with a slope Cr (see Fig. 2-17a) that
is parallel to the actual e versus log p curve as a best fit by eye. Use an average of the
recompression and the reload slope for computing Cr for slope of NO if an unload-reload
test branch has been produced.


Figure 2-21 Soil relationships for settlement equations. The left side is laboratory; the right side is field rela-
tionships.

5. At the intersection of step 4 and p'c (point O) draw a line OM to the point M established
instep 1.
6. The slope of the line from step 5 is the approximate corrected value of Cc for the curve
branch beyond p'c.
Sample disturbance always reduces the field value of Cc to a lesser value, with a com-
pletely remolded sample representing the minimum. As a consequence even corrected val-
ues tend to be somewhat lower than the true values. Holtz et al. (1986) reported results from
block samples carved by hand versus high-quality piston samples. Although there was not
a great difference between these two recovery procedures, it appeared that any disturbance
reduced Cc. In passing, note that if we take a hand-carved block and obtain two consolidation
test samples, one with a horizontal H orientation and one with a vertical V orientation, we
can compute K0 as
r Pc,H
Pc,V
From the settlement ratio shown on Fig. 2-21 one can compute the settlement (either lab
or field) with the aid of Eqs. (2-31) and (2-34) as

Ai/ = -T^—H = mv(Ap)H (2-43)
1 + eo
If we substitute Eq. (2-31) into Eq. (2-43); use Ae = de, Ap = dp', and observe that mv =
1/E5, we obtain

AH = ^H = eH

From this expression and inspection of Eq. (2-43) it is evident that the strain is e = AeI(X +
eo).ls This relationship is most useful, since it depends only on the change in void ratio Ae
and the initial void ratio e0. Now we can write Eq. (2-43) as
AH = eH (2-43«)

18TMs 6 is referenced to the initial height. Note that the incremental e computed in the table shown on Fig. 2-19
uses Ae = et-\ - et and 1 + e(-_i, that is, the void ratio at the beginning of the load increment so that 1 + et-i is H1-.

More commonly we use Cc in computing AH in an equation obtained by substitution for
Ae from Eq. (2-42) into Eq. (2-43) to give
±H=WlogP'o + *P (2-44)
1 + eo po
This is simply another form of Eq. (2-43<z) with the terms identified as follows:

Cc = compression index from the e versus log p plot (corrected as necessary)
eo = in situ void ratio in the stratum where Cc was obtained
H = stratum thickness. If the stratum is very thick (say 6+ m) it should be subdivided
into several sublayers of Hi = 2 to 3 m, with each having its own eo and Cc. Com-
pute the several values of AHi and then sum them to obtain the total consolidation
settlement AH.
pfo = effective overburden pressure at midheight of H
Ap = average increase in pressure from the foundation loads in layer H and in the same
units as for p'o
The computed settlement from Eq. (2-44) will be in the units of H.
From the definition of the compression ratio C'c previously given and using AH = e//we
can obtain the settlement as

AH = C'CH log EklAl (2-45)
Po
By equating Eqs. (2-44) and (2-45) a very useful relationship between Cc and Cc is obtained
as

C - ^ (2-46)

These equations are directly applicable for normally consolidated soils. When the soil is
preconsolidated they should be adjusted as follows (and with reference to Fig. 2-22). Taking
the stress increase as
Ap = Ap\ + Ap2
where Ap2 is any part of Ap that is along the Cc zone to the right of p'c, we have the total
settlement consisting of two parts—that from po to p'c and that (if any) from p ' c + . These are
computed from Eq. (2-44) as follows:

Parti:

Part 2: (if any)

Figure 2-22 Enlargement of upper part of
Fig 2-11 a to compute the settlement from a

The total primary consolidation settlement is
AHP = AH1 + AH2
You may substitute the equivalent forms of Eq. (2-45) when you use a plot of e versus
log p to obtain the total settlement AH. Carefully note that primary consolidation is defined
as that state when the excess pore pressure AM —> 0. Settlement usually continues beyond
this point for some time.

2-10.5 Large Strain Consolidation
Recall that the Terzaghi consolidation theory is applicable only for small strains (or settle-
ment). When the consolidating material is in a sludge pond or dredged hydraulic fills, and
a settlement estimate (which may be over half of the fill depth) is wanted—together with
a time estimate—some alternative means of estimating the total consolidation settlement is
required.
Quantifying the settlement of sludge ponds and hydraulic fills is particularly difficult be-
cause initially one has a sedimentation problem. The elapsed time for much of this depends
on Stokes' law (as used in hydrometer tests) and may be speeded somewhat if some kind of
flocculating agent can be used so that the small particles form larger clumps that can settle
faster.
After sedimentation there is some thickness of solids with a very high natural water content
and large void ratio e (which can be 20 or more). The consolidation of this material is from the
self-weight computed as ys - jf (difference between the solids and fluid unit weights). Since
ys can and usually does vary considerably over both depth and time, it is clearly evident this
is a most formidable problem, which can be solved analytically only by making a number
of assumptions. For this reason it is most useful to assemble a database on the settlement
response of different types of sludges and hydraulic fills. Databases such as these, which
would be based on field verification using settlement-measuring devices, enable one to make
better estimates of time and consolidation than with no database.

Townsend and McVay (1990, see also the discussion in January 1992) focused on using
some type of computer program for the estimates of time and AH, and they cite a total of 10.
This rather large number of computer programs results from the great difficulty in defining the
problem in a form suitable for a computer model. As a consequence the greatest confidence
likely to be had in any of these programs is by its author.
Tan et al. (1991) suggest using a hyperbolic method. The general form of the hyperbolic
method (which is almost identical to that presented earlier in Sec. 2-10.2, where a = C and
P = M) is
s = — ? — (2-47)

If time t —> oo the settlement limit s (= AH) = 1//3. It is useful to rearrange Eq. (2-47) and
obtain

- = a + pt (2-4Ia)
s
which is a straight line plot of t/s versus t (see Fig. 2-23). It is more useful, however, to
rearrange again to obtain
f-^- = a +Pd-U)
s Si (2AIb)
^ = a + P(M)

or in U - T space

£ ^ f = a +p(T- T1) (2-Mc)

where t = some time after initial time U
s = settlement (usually symbolized as AH but it is convenient here to use the
symbol s) at some time t with Si = settlement at time r,-
a = constant determined from the linear plot at t = At = 0
p = slope of the straight line part of the plot of At/As curve
Ut T = as previously defined in Sec. 2-10.1

The hyperbolic method is used as follows:

1. Take elapsed time (usually days) and settlement (usually millimeters or centimeters) data
for the consolidating location and start a plot of t/s versus t. When the plotted points pro-
duce a reasonably straight line (termed the hyperbolic line) you can obtain a by project-
ing to the ordinate and simply measuring the slope to obtain /3. Note that if you start
t = s = 0, the plot values are directly measured.
2. It is necessary to take t and s data for a sufficiently long time that the curve does not deviate
from the straight line [see Carrier (1993)]. After what you deem a suitable time lapse, use
the plot to obtain the data to substitute into Eq. (2-47) to compute the settlement s(= AH)
for the consolidating mass at some arbitrary time based on data taken to this point.


t, days
Figure 2-23 Hyperbolic plot of time versus settlement. The "hyperbolic" line deviates in full plot A but is
reasonably linear when reinitialized using to = 30 days and so = 11 cm so that the slope of the reinitialized line
gives a ~ 3.9 and slope /3 =0.1. From computations on the figure at 230 days the settlement is 19.37 cm (you
should verify at 1,030 days that the settlement « 20.6 cm). Clearly, most of the settlement has occurred in the
90-day time increment.

3. If a new "straight" section deviates from the initial straight line after some elapsed time t,
there is usually a cause such as adding or removing surcharge (or fill), water table lower-
ing, or the like. When this deviation occurs, reinitialize the previous curve. Reinitialization
consists in using the time and settlement values at some time in the vicinity of the devia-
tion of the points from the straight line and recomputing the plot points. For example, Fig.
2-23 shows linear deviation at t = 43 days, s = 13.5 cm. We will arbitrarily reinitialize

To make a final settlement estimate, obtain a and /3 from the linear hyperbolic curve and
compute a table of settlement values s using several arbitrarily selected time values t in Eq.
(2-47Z?) until time increases result in almost no increase in settlement s. Plot these values on
a graph of time t versus settlement s. The approximate asymptote represents the maximum
estimated settlement. With care and enough t and s field data you may be able to estimate the
final total settlement within 10 to 20 percent.

2-10.6 Secondary Consolidation
After primary consolidation the soil structure continues to adjust to the load for some ad-
ditional time. This settlement is termed secondary consolidation or secondary compression
and may continue for many years, but at an approximately logarithmic rate. At the end of
secondary consolidation the soil has reached a new K0 state. The total settlement when ac-
counting for both primary AHp and secondary AH8 compression is
Atftotai = AHp + AH8
The slope of a plot of deformation versus log time beyond the Dioo location is used (see
Fig. 2-13a) to obtain the secondary compression index Ca, computed as
= M1M1 = A^_ (2.48)
log hltx log f2/fi
Now using this Ca index, the field secondary compression (or settlement) AHS after some
time ^ = h + Aris computed as
AH8 = HfCalog^ (2-49)

where for the preceding two equations
Hu = thickness of laboratory sample at time f ,-
AHi5 = change in sample thickness at some time ti taken from the deformation versus log
time curve; try to use one log cycle
t2 = time at end of primary consolidation t\ + At as just defined and consistent with
cv. Find the initial field time t\ using Eq. (2-38), then rearrange to find tgo (use
T = 0.848 from Table 2-4) and t\oo « W0.9; for Ar choose some convenient
time lapse.


Hf = thickness of field-consolidating stratum at the end of primary consolidation. Com-
monly one uses initial thickness unless the primary consolidation is very large, say,
more than 10 percent of the initial thickness.

The slope of the secondary branch of the deformation versus log time curve is very nearly
a constant for a remolded soil but varies with the load for "undisturbed" soil samples. For
"undisturbed" field samples you should obtain Ca as the slope of that curve from that labo-
ratory pressure closest to the estimated field loading.
Secondary consolidation (or settlement) is only a small component of the total settlement
for most inorganic soils. For highly organic soils (for example, very peaty) the secondary
settlement component may be larger than the primary consolidation value.

2-10.7 Compression Index Correlations
A laboratory consolidation test takes a considerable amount of time and is both labor- and
computation-intensive (unless the test has been automated19). In any case it is rather expen-
sive, and in most cases at least two—and preferably three—tests should be performed in each
critical stratum. Because of these factors a substantial effort has been undertaken to attempt
to correlate the compression indexes to some other more easily determined soil index prop-
erties. Also, if the first laboratory consolidation test correlates reasonably well with one or
more of the following expressions, additional verification tests may not be required.
Correlations have particular value in preliminary site studies before extensive soil explo-
ration and testing is undertaken for a final design
Table 2-5 lists several equations, along with their sources, that might be used to make
compression index estimates. If the compression ratio Cc or other ratios are used, they can
be obtained from expressions such as Eq. (2-46); but you must somehow estimate the in situ
void ratio eo (usually from an estimated Gs in the range of 2.68 to 2.72).
It appears that better values are obtained when more than one index property is used (re-
member that Ip uses both the liquid and plastic limits).
Because the compression settlement also depends on the initial in situ void ratio eo, it is
probably better to use those equations that include eo either directly or indirectly (y or WN).
Here are suggestions for using Table 2-5:

1. It might be more useful if you have done at least one consolidation test and then use a
correlation to verify it (say within ±10 percent).
2. If you have not done any consolidation tests, you should use at least two table equations
and average the results.
3. You should start compiling a local database so that you can identify one of the equations,
with minor adjustments to the numerical constants, as defining the local soil.

19A computer program such as that in Bowles (1992) is helpful in consolidation test data reduction.

2-10.8 Compression Index Correlations and Preconsolidation
A reliable estimate of the effective preconsolidation pressure p'c is difficult without perform-
ing a consolidation test. There have been a few correlations given for p'c of which one was
given by Nagaraj and Srinivasa Murthy (1985, 1986) for saturated soils preconsolidated by
overburden pressure (as opposed to shrinkage or chemical factors):
log10 p'c = 5.97 - 5.32(wN/wL) - 0.25 log10 p'o (2-50)
As an example, for
wN = 25%; wL = 50% (liquid limit);


The OCR = 776/48 = 16. While this is a very large OCR, we could have predicted that there
would be some overconsolidation, with w^ = WL/2—certainly a case where WM is closer to
wp than to w^.
For soils preconsolidated by cementation and shrinkage Nagaraj and Srinivasa Murthy
(1985, 1986) suggest
p'c = 3.1Ssu - 2.9 (units of kPa) (2-51)
where su = in situ undrained shear strength as defined in Sec. 2-11A and determined by the
field vane shear test described in Sec. 3-12.
As previously noted, it is possible to estimate whether a soil is preconsolidated from over-
burden pressure by noting the position of the natural water content w^ with respect to the
Atterberg limits of wp and wi on Fig. 2-2a:

1. If WM is closer to the liquid limit Wi than to wp the soil is likely to be normally consoli-
dated.
2. If WM is closer to the plastic limit wp than to Wi the soil is likely to be preconsolidated.

Unfortunately this information cannot be used in a quantitative manner or for over- or pre-
consolidation caused by shrinkage or chemical action. All that can be said with any certainty
is that if the soil is preconsolidated it is not likely to settle as much under a foundation load
as a similar soil in a normally consolidated state.

2-11 SHEAR STRENGTH
Soil strength is the resistance to mass deformation developed from a combination of particle
rolling, sliding, and crushing and is reduced by any pore pressure that exists or develops
during particle movement. This resistance to deformation is the shear strength of the soil
as opposed to the compressive or tensile strength of other engineering materials. The shear
strength is measured in terms of two soil parameters: interparticle attraction or cohesion c,
and resistance to interparticle slip called the angle of internal friction </>. Grain crushing,
resistance to rolling, and other factors are implicitly included in these two parameters. In
equation form the shear strength in terms of total stresses is
s = c + crtan</> (2-52)
and, using effective strength parameters,
s = c' + <r'tan</>' (2-52a)
where terms not identified earlier are
s = shear strength (sometimes called r), kPa, ksf, etc.
a = normal stress on shear plane (either total a or effective <r'), kPa, ksf, etc.
a' = a - u = effective normal stress (defined in Sec. 2-9)

The strength parameters are often used as constants, but they are quite dependent on the
type of laboratory test, previous stress history, and current state (particle packing, grain shape,
and water content). As a consequence, obtaining accurate values is not a trivial task, and the
values obtained actually apply only to the current soil state. Also whereas Eq. (2-52) has a
linear form, in real soils for the reasons just cited thi^ equation is often a curve.
The shear envelope defined by Eq. (2-52), obtained from the locus of tangent points to a
series of Mohr's circles (see Fig. 2-24), constitutes the limiting states of soil stresses. Since
there are two parameters in these equations (c, </>), at least two soil tests must be performed
to obtain their values using either simultaneous equations or, most commonly, a graphical
solution. From the Mohr's circle20 of Fig. 2-24, the normal stress on the shear plane in terms
of principal stresses cr\ and cr3 is
<rn= Zl^Zl+ El^Zl cos 26 (2-53)
The principal stress difference a\ - cr3 (also called the deviator stress Acri) used above and
as shown on Fig. 2-24 at failure is the instant increase in compression stress starting from
(J3. The vertical stress increase A/7 from foundation loads in situ from p'o is also the deviator
stress.

clarity and to include shear strength terminology. Also shown is orientation of the shear plane in sample and shear
and normal stresses on plane. Note conventional use of first quadrant for stress plot even though stresses are all
compressive. In-depth theory of Mohr's circle construction is available in introductory geotechnical, mechanics of
materials, and statics textbooks.

20It is usual in geotechnical practice to plot Mohr's circles in the first quadrant since both principal stresses are
compressive but consistently used as (+) values.

we obtain the following two equations to which reference is made a number of times in this

(T3 = ax tan2 J45° - ^ j - 2c tan J45° - | j (2-55)
The shear strength of a soil is heavily dependent on the type of test and on pore water
conditions, which may be generalized as follows:
1. Unconsolidated'Undrained(UU or U) tests. The sample is placed in a compression testing
machine and immediately loaded to failure. The failure stress is the unconfined compres-
sion strength qu for clay soils. This test can also be performed in a shear box, where the
shearing stress is begun as soon as the vertical load is applied. In this latter case the shear
stress is plotted versus the normal stress to obtain the undrained shear strength su (see Fig.
2'2Ib). The sample is free to drain, but with a low coefficient of permeability k not enough
occurs to say the sample has drained.
For cohesionless soils this test must be performed in a triaxial cell or shear box. For
these soils the drained shear strength parameter (/>' is obtained, even if the soil is saturated,
unless the test is performed at an unrealistic rate of speed with a sample so fine-grained it
has a very low coefficient of permeability k.
Sometimes clay samples are put in a triaxial cell, a cell pressure is applied, and the
compression is done immediately. This procedure is not recommended because of the time
involved and additional sample disturbance produced.
2. Consolidated-undrained (CU) tests. The sample is consolidated with drain lines open until
no further drainage occurs (it has consolidated). The drain lines are then closed, and the
sample is tested to failure (undrained). In cohesive soils this test generally produces both
a cohesion intercept c and a cf> angle that is intermediate between 0 and </>' depending on
the degree of saturation S.
The test may be given a designation based on the type of cell consolidation pressure
used:
I = isotropic (constant all around, as usually obtained in the triaxial cell)
K0 = consolidated with some vertical pressure and with lateral pressure set to an estimate
of the field value of Koav. This test requires special equipment and is seldom done.
A = anisotropically consolidated (vertical not same as lateral but lateral is not Kocrv)
These types of consolidation give a test designation as CIUC (consolidated isotropically
and undrained compression) or CK^UE (consolidated to K0 and tested in undrained ex-
tension). There are others, but this explanation should give you a general idea when you
see these test designations in the literature.
3. Consolidated-drained (CD) tests. In these tests (seldom done) the sample is consolidated
by one of the methods for the consolidated-undrained test, and when drainage is com-


plete the test is commenced—but at such a slow rate that the excess pore pressure can
be neglected. There is always some excess pore pressure above the static level, as it is
impossible for there to be any strain or particle movement without this pressure taking
place.
This brings us to the crux of the problem. When a site soil is loaded by some new load and
consolidates under water to a "consolidated" state, the pore pressure is not zero. Rather, the
pore pressure is the static head (ywhw), which can be—depending on hw—significant. This is
not a consolidated-drained state but rather one of a number of consolidated-undrained states
that can develop in this mass. It just happens that at this instant the pore pressure is the static
head.
This current state is based on some pressure that caused a particle rearrangement from the
previous (also consolidated-undrained) state. The pressure that caused this current state is
now a new historical imprint.
The common laboratory procedure to obtain CU-parameters is to consolidate about three or
four samples isotropically in a triaxial cell using a different cell pressure for each sample and,
from the several deviator stresses and cell pressures, plot data to draw a best-fit Mohr's stress
envelope so that an "undrained" value of c and <f> are obtained. If the total pore pressure is
measured, one can obtain both "undrained" CU and "drained" CD parameters c » 0; <f> -» </>'
(see Fig. 2-326).
Actual field conditions usually involve increasing the stress from some initial value to
some new value. After some time elapses the pore pressure returns to the static level and
strain stops, with some increase in soil density. A new stress increase results in this process
repeating,..., etc. The soil is certainly not going from one consolidated-drained state to an-
other one. There is only one set of strength parameters for the consolidated-drained state, but
here we have values depending on the current stress level versus the previous one,..., etc.
Laboratory tests tend to be categorized as compression if the sample is compressed or
shear if the sample is sheared to obtain the desired strength information.
Shear strength tends to be anisotropic (horizontal strength not the same as vertical) as a
result of the way a soil mass develops from sedimentation (or even in residual soils from
weathering and leaching). In view of this observation, current practice suggests that one look
at the location of the likely failure mode (shear, compression) and perform a laboratory test
consistent with the general orientation of the failure zone as illustrated in Fig. 2-25.

2-11.1 Shear Tests
These tests are made using either direct shear (Fig. 2-26a), which is most common, or direct
simple shear (Fig. 2-266) equipment. For controlled pore water conditions and for stress re-
versal studies, the direct simple shear device is used. There are several configurations of the
direct simple shear test, but the most common uses a round sample 2.0 cm in height with an
area of 50 cm2. The wire-reinforced rubber membrane (see Fig. 2-266) prevents lateral de-
formation during consolidation from vertical load Pv. Moving the top cap laterally produces
shear stresses, and by monitoring the deformations and adjusting the vertical load the sample
can be sheared at a constant volume and water content. Attaching the cap to a load-cycling
machine to produce shear stress reversals allows the device to be used in dynamic and liq-
uefaction studies. Using the direct simple shear device produces DSS tests (see Fig. 2-25 for
typical use).


Figure 2-25 Strength tests corresponding to field shear. [After Ladd et ai (1977) and Johnson (1975).] The
unconfmed compression test is commonly used for all cases.

Both test devices shown on Fig. 2-26 allow one to consolidate a sample to K0 conditions.
A compression load on the laterally confined sample produces a state of zero lateral strain
with consolidation complete when vertical strain —» zero for a reasonable time period. This is
by definition a K0 state with principal stresses on the vertical and horizontal planes. Whether
this is the same K0 as in situ is speculative, but if an in situ vertical consolidation stress is
used it is about the best that can be done. "Undisturbed" samples can be obtained for cohesive
soils; however, cohesionless samples are usually completely remolded between recovery and
insertion into the shear box so that any geological history (aging, cementation, structure, etc.)
is lost. A replication of void ratio does not necessarily reproduce the in situ soil structure.
The stress state in direct shear type tests is somewhat indeterminate (there is wide disagree-
ment [see Saada and Townsend (1981)] among engineers about the value of these tests), but
those who use the test assume that applying the lateral shearing load to the sample produces
a plane strain condition with a shear stress s of known magnitude on the horizontal plane and
an effective normal stress crn computed from the sample load Pv and original cross-sectional
area. This is somewhat in error, however, from the required rotation of principal planes during
shear as shown on Fig. 2-26a.
We may perform several tests (always more than two) at several values of an or vertical
loads and make plots as in Fig. 2-27 to obtain graphically the Ph maximum and the soil
parameters <f> and c—which may be total or effective—depending on whether excess pore
pressure existed on the shear plane at the failure load or if AM was measured.

2-11.2 Compression Tests
Although we often perform compression tests on soil samples, the data are always presented
in terms of shear strength or used to obtain a stress-strain relationship as the stress-strain
modulus or modulus of deformation Es.

Figure 2-26 The two most common direct shear type devices for laboratory testing.

Unconfined compression tests to obtain a compressive strength, always termed qu, can
be performed using almost any type of compression-loading device on cohesive samples.
The compression device must have a reasonable load accuracy at the low loads at which soil
samples usually fail. In the test a length of sample (usually length/diameter > 2) is placed
in the device and compressed to failure. Load and deformation data are taken periodically to
plot a stress-strain curve (as on Fig. 2-28) if desired. From the average of several peak (or
residual) strength values a Mohr's circle may be drawn to obtain the undrained shear strength
su = qjl = cohesion. If the Mohr's circle uses the residual strength (see Fig. 2-2Ia), the
"residual" strength parameters are obtained.
Confined compression tests are similar to unconfined tests except for the sample confine-
ment during testing. These tests are usually considered to be of better quality but at higher

costs in terms of sample recovery and the extra time for sample preparation, testing, and
data reduction. A confining (triaxial) cell (see Fig. 2-29) is required with the compression
machine. The triaxial cell should have the facility to do the following:
1. Apply a confining pressure to the sample, which is usually encased in a rubber membrane.
This pressure may be from air or from using a liquid such as water (with rust inhibitor)
or a mixture of water and glycerine where greater viscosity is needed to control seepage
at higher pressures and where volume displacements are measured or controlled. This
facility allows one to test either cohesionless or cohesive soil samples.
2. Be able to seal the sample so that interior pore water conditions can be somewhat con-
trolled. That is, one must have the facility to drain or saturate the sample. Sample sat-
uration is a time-consuming process for cohesive samples, so it is necessary to be able
to pressurize the pore fluid (termed "back pressure") so that saturation occurs at a faster
rate. The use of back pressure also allows one to perform the test at the in situ pore pres-
sure. The pore-pressure lines require facility for drainage control so that volume changes
during sample consolidation can be measured. Also by opening the sample drain lines
one may perform a "drained" test. Alternatively, by saturating the sample and lines and
then closing the top one of Fig. 2-29 and attaching a pore-pressure (pressure transducer)
measuring device, we can measure the excess pore pressure (at that end of the sample)
developed during a CU test so that we can correct the total stress parameters to obtain the
effective stress parameters </>' and c'.

Reasonably "undisturbed" cohesive samples can be tested if we accept "undisturbance"
as including sample recovery + transporting to the laboratory + sample preparation and
insertion into the rubber membrane. It is evident that an undisturbed cohesionless sample is
not possible—it is difficult even to reproduce the in situ density.
Worst-case conditions (or soil parameters) are usually obtained from testing saturated soils;
however, S = 100 percent is not a necessary test condition. One should try to test the soil in
the worst water content case likely to occur at the site during the life of the engineered works.
Triaxial extension tests can also be performed and for certain situations (see Fig. 2-25, code
2) will provide better strength parameters. These usually require stress-controlled equipment
whereas the common triaxial equipment from most laboratory supply organizations provides
strain-controlled devices. In strain control an electric motor advances the loading head at a
constant strain rate (mm/min). To perform an extension test we should be able to hold the
vertical stress and either increase or decrease the cell pressure. Normally, of course, we hold
the cell pressure and increase the vertical load (or pressure a\).
The cell pressure a3 = ac in a triaxial test may be one of the following:
a c = mp'o

(jc = mpo (termed the mean normal stress)

The multiplier m may range from ^ < r a < 2 t o 3 x OCR.

2-11.3 Cohesionless Soils
Cohesionless soils are always tested in a consolidated-drained condition so that effective
stress (f)' values are obtained. They are consolidated either from the normal pressure in di-
rect shear tests or from the cell pressure in a triaxial test. As they have a high permeability, it
takes very little time for consolidation pore pressures to dissipate. It is only necessary, then, to
perform the test at a strain rate low enough that the remaining water does not produce excess
pore pressure of consequence. Testing a saturated cohesionless sample in U or CU conditions
is meaningless.
In addition to other factors previously discussed, the angle of internal friction of cohesion-
less soils depends on the density or relative density (see Fig. 2-30) and the confining pressure
(Fig. 2-31). This latter is of some importance for pile points founded at great depths in the
sand with high confining pressures from overburden.
It has been found that the angle of internal friction from a triaxial test (</>tr) is from 1 to
5 degrees smaller than that from a plane strain test (0ps). Plane strain is, of course, what a
direct shear test purports to produce. In the field when a long wall leans forward under lateral
soil pressure, plane strain conditions develop along the length except at the ends. Similarly, a
long footing for a wall is a plane strain case versus a triaxial case for a square footing. Several
adjustments have been proposed to obtain the plane strain </> from triaxial values. An early
proposal was
0ps = l.l^tr (0tr^3O°) (2-56)
This was also suggested by Lee (1970). Meyerhof modified this equation slightly to transition
from a full triaxial to a full plane strain case for footings using 1.1 - 0.1B/L. Later Lade and

In general, it is not recommended to adjust </>tr unless it is larger than 32-35°, and the ad-
justment should be limited to not more than 5°. If values are larger, give consideration to
performing plane strain tests.
The angle of internal friction, as previously noted, implicitly includes factors in addition
to interparticle friction. If 0 only measured interparticle friction the angle would probably
range from about 26 to 30 degrees. Also, contrary to some early opinion, water does not
provide a measurable lubrication effect—its primary effects are surface tension and excess
pore pressures.

2-11.4. Normally Consolidated Clay (S -» 100 percent)
The unconfined compression test gives the compressive strength qu. The test can be made
on any cohesive sample (regardless of water content) and is routinely made on recovered
cohesive samples during field boring operations. It is estimated that recovery of thin-walled
tube samples (the better-quality samples) produces disturbance that reduces the strength 20
to 60 percent with much of the reduction from loss of overburden pressure. However, when
this loss occurs the sample tends to expand and negative pore pressures are developed, which
tend to confine the sample and produce some strength increase. From this combination, some

authorities claim the unconfined compression strength is near the true value. Others estimate
that at best qu is not more than about 80 percent of the "true" strength. In usual design, several
values of qu from the same stratum are averaged as the design value. For bearing capacity a
factor of safety (or uncertainty) of 3 is commonly applied to qu.
One could test a sample in the triaxial cell as a U test using a cell pressure of ac = 0;
however, since the result is qu there is no point in the extra effort. We do, however, com-
monly perform a CK0V or CIU test series (three or more tests) using increasing values of cell
pressure ac. With consolidation at different stress levels, even for undrained testing, there
is often a measurable set of total stress parameters <f> and c as on Fig. 2-32. If the excess
pore pressure at failure (AM/) is measured, we may adjust the total stress Mohr's circles as
shown on Fig. 2-32b to obtain the effective stress envelope with a cohesion intercept of ap-
proximately zero and the effective angle of internal friction </>' (here of 33°). The slope of the

stress-strain curves is used to obtain E5 (as shown earlier on Fig. 2-2Sa). Usually the initial
tangent value is used, but a secant modulus may be more appropriate in the general range of
field loading.
In general, the shear strength for normally consolidated clays is as follows:

Unconfined compression: su = c = qj2 (a <j) = 0 state or case)
Consolidated-undrained: su = c + a tan <j>
Consolidated-drained (or CU adjusted for AM/): Sd = a' tan</>'

Carefully note that there is no measurable cohesion in the drained strength Sd case for a
normally consolidated clay. Referring to the Mohr's circle of Fig. 2-28Z? for qu, we see that the
drained strength goes from a case of c = qu/2 to a case of c = 0 and </>' > 0. In some region
along the abscissa it is evident that the drained strength is less than the undrained strength.
Some embankment failures have been attributed to this phenomenon. From this, one may
conclude that the undrained shear strength is a behavior and not a unique soil property and
depends on the test method as well as sample state (e, w>, etc.).

2-11.5 Overconsolidated Intact Clay (S -* 100 percent)
The undrained or CU test tends to give a higher strength su for overconsolidated clays than
for normally consolidated clays, e.g., the Mohr's circles of Figs. 2-28 and 2-32 have a larger

diameter. The increase in stress is attributed to a combination of increased density from the
consolidating pressure and negative pore pressures developed when the sample tends to ex-
pand from loss of overburden pressure during recovery. Any negative (suction) pressure tends
to hold grains in closer contact, so the friction and particle displacement resistances are larger.
The CU test will give higher values also if the cell pressure 0-3 < p'c and if the OCR is
larger than about 4. This phenomenon is attributed to negative pore pressures from sample
recovery and to the negative pressures that develop during shear on the shearing plane as the
sample expands (or dilates). Any strength increases produced by negative pore pressures are
unsafe for field use. This is because negative pressures are destroyed when environmental
free water is absorbed. Experimental evidence indicates that if 0-3 < p'c and the OCR is less
than about 4, then negative pore pressures do not develop during the CU test.
When the cell pressure cr3 is greater than the preconsolidation pressure p'c the sample re-
sponds as if the clay is normally consolidated. This fact is illustrated in Fig. 2-33. Note again
that for normally consolidated clays there is a negligible cohesion intercept under drained con-
ditions. For overconsolidated clays at initial stress conditions (0-3 of cell) less than the precon-
solidation pressure there is a measurable cohesion intercept for both drained and undrained
conditions. It should also be noted that for overconsolidated clays, the initial branch of the
shear stress envelope is seldom a straight line, so that one must make a best estimate of the
value of </>or </>'.

2-11.6 Fissured Clays
Fissures or cracks form in surficial clays during alternate cycles of wetting and drying. Over
geological periods a deposit may contain an aggregation of clay blocks in loose to close
attachment and much crack contamination from windblown silt, sand, organic materials, or a
combination. One may readily observe shrinkage cracks in the soil at the bottoms of dry water
holes, in yards, and other ground surfaces after prolonged (or intense) dry periods. Sometimes
these visible fissures may be several meters in length, one or more meters in depth, and from

S

a


5 to 3O+ mm in width. These clays are usually found above the water table, but regional
geological changes may relocate deposits of fissured clays at some depth or below existing
lakes or oceans.
In any case, both sample recovery and strength testing are very difficult on fissured
clays. Sampling is difficult because the apparent preconsolidation may be 8 or more, and
the soil—especially above the GWT—may be very hard and brittle. Driving pressures in
sample recovery can collapse thin-walled tubes, and the use of thick-walled tubes tends to
produce excessive sample disturbance. Where the sampler cuts fissures, the recovery may
be a tube of bits and pieces of soil. If an "intact" sample is recovered, the strength may be
affected by any fissures in the sample (sometimes covered by smearing of adjacent soil).
Depending on fissuring, any foundation bridging, and moisture control, testing an intact
sample may give an unrealistically high strength, and a fissured sample an unrealistically
low strength.
For these several reasons, considerable engineering judgment is required to interpret the
design parameters for a fissured clay. A principal consideration is control of environmental
water after the foundation is installed since the fissures allow ready access to the interior of
the soil mass for a general, rather than surface, softening and/or swell.
Fissured clays are found over wide regions worldwide, and in the United States over large
areas of the Southwest. Some of the problems in the Southwest are considered by McManis
and Arman (1986) and Mahar and O'Neill (1983).

2-11.7 Residual Strength and Critical Void Ratio
Soil failures in situ result in volume changes along the shear plane and a considerable remold-
ing of the soil so that a significant strength reduction takes place. Since soil in any remolded
state has some strength that we may term the residual strength, its value may be of interest
in select foundation problems. A case of considerable interest is the strength of a mass of soil
(or other particulate material) that must be held in place by a retaining wall.
Since all failures are from loads that exceed the shear strength of the soil, particle dis-
placements during shear result in one of the following:

1. Increase in volume (or void ratio e) for dense soils. Thus, if pore water is present there
is an increase in water content on the failure plane. In a laboratory compression test the
failure plane is clearly identified on dense or brittle soil samples.
2. Decrease in volume (or e) for loose soils and a reduction in water content along the failure
plane. An identifiable failure plane is seldom observed in a compression test for these
samples—they shorten and thicken.
3. No change in volume if the present void ratio is at a value termed the critical void ratio.
This void ratio seldom exists in situ, but dense and loose samples converge to this value of
e at some strain level. The strength value where the several curves of different initial soil
states converge (as Fig. 2-34 or Fig. 2.21a) for the dense and loose soil samples is termed
the residual strength.

In the laboratory tests the soil may fail suddenly or gradually. Sudden failures occur at
some relatively low strain when the soil is dense and/or the particles are well-bonded. This
brittle effect may be from natural aging and cementation, from being at a somewhat dry state,


from being well-compacted (for remolded samples), or from a combination of factors. Gradual
failures at large strains occur when the soil is loose or wet and/or when one is using wet
remolded samples. Normally consolidated saturated, uncemented, clays tend to have gradual
failures; overconsolidated or cemented (aged) clays tend to brittle failures.
These failures are typified by the stress-strain curves of Fig. 2-34a and of Figs. 2-27a and
2-32«. Brittle or sudden failures produce stress-strain curves with a definable peak. Gradual
failures produce stress-strain curves with no definable peak (such as curve b of Fig. 2-34<z).
With no definable peak the maximum deviator stress is often defined at some percent strain.
A value of 15 percent (e = 0.15) is commonly used.
At the residual strength the soil is sufficiently remolded that there is negligible cohesion
[but there may be excess (+) or ( - ) pore-pressure contributions to the stress reduction],
and the principal resistance is from friction produced by interparticle friction and rolling
resistance. We may term this parameter the residual angle of internal friction 4>r and define
the residual shear strength in general terms as
sr = cr + (7tan<£r (2-58)
The residual strength parameters cr and <f)r can be obtained by plotting residual Ph versus Pv
of the direct shear test (Fig. 2-27Z?) or from the residual deviator stresses Ao> from a triaxial
test as on Fig. 2-34Z?. Equation (2-58) represents the lower bound strength of any soil. Some
are of the opinion that <£r is the true angle of internal friction of the soil.

2-11.8 Design Shear Strength Values
From the preceding discussion the question of what to use for the design strength parameters
{sUyd or <f> and c values) naturally arises. The answers are various.
1. The expression su>d = c = qj2 is very widely used and generally provides a conservative
value where field loading conditions and water content are duplicated by the rapid test
loading. The worst-case strength is when the test sample is saturated. Rapid loading occurs
when an embankment is constructed within about 2 weeks or when the foundation loading
from the superstructure occurs in about 2-3 weeks. Figure 2-28fc illustrates that if it is
possible for "drained" conditions to exist, the drained strength can be substantially less
than su—depending on the current normal pressure crn.
2. Parameters from CIUC tests are probably the next most widely used. The test is easier
but gives su/pfo ratios somewhat higher than C^0 UC tests. Instead of triaxial tests, direct
shear or direct simple shear (CA^-type) tests may be made. CIU and shear tests are of
about equal difficulty and cost.
3. Use drained strength (CIUC with pore-pressure measurements) when drained field loading
occurs or to check long-term stability under the load.
4. Use sUtd = \(su,c + SU,E + SU,D) where su>c is from C^0 UC, SU>E is from CAT0UE triaxial
tests, and SU>D is from the direct simple shear test. According to Aas et al. (1986) (who also
cite others) this may be the best value and is applicable for embankments, excavations,
and shallow foundations. This strength parameter is also the most costly to obtain.

Although the foregoing comments may be used as a guide, each project must be evaluated
separately for the strength recommendation. There are simply too many project-dependent

percent).

considerations to make a blanket recommendation to use either this or that particular strength
value in any general-use publication such as this.

2-11.9 Shear Strength Correlations and the su/p'o Ratio
Shear strength correlations or parameters are widely used for both preliminary and final de-
sign studies. For example, shear tests on cohesionless soils are seldom made to obtain </>.
Instead, tabulated values as in Table 2-6 or values from in situ testing as in Table 3-4 are
commonly used.
The drained angle of internal friction of cohesive soils can be estimated from correlations
such as those in Fig. 2-35. This figure represents a best-fit set of curves from plotting a very
large number of tests. The scatter is substantial, and some of the more extreme values have
been plotted to alert the user. Note that, whereas some of the scatter is inevitable as a result
of the heterogeneity of soils, some is due to the difficulty in reproducing wL and wP val-
ues between different laboratory technicians and laboratories. This difficulty is due both to
technician skill and poorly adjusted liquid limit test equipment.
Normalized material behavior is obtained when a parameter of significance divided by an-
other parameter gives a unique relationship. Generally normalization is discovered by simple
trial, with the objective of reducing the property of interest to some quantity that displays a
definite trend (a plot without substantial scatter of data points). The modulus of elasticity is a
normalized parameter that is common for all elastic materials. The sjp'o ratio is one that has
been in use since the late 1940s, when many clay soils were found (by trial) to exhibit nor-
malized behavior between the ratio of the undrained shear strength su, the in situ overburden
pressure p'o, and some index property /,- in a generalized form as

Following are several correlations of this general form for normally consolidated clays:

1. Bjerrum and Simons (1960) provided Eq. (2-59) as a best fit to curves given in Figs. 7 and
8 of their work:
sjp'o = 0.45(/P)1/2 IP > 0.5 (2-59)
This equation has a scatter in the range of ±25 percent. Using the liquidity index [see Eq.
(2-14)] they derived an approximation of
sjp'o = 0.18(/L)1/2 IL > 0.5 (2-59a)
In both of these equations, use the plasticity index and liquidity index as decimal entries.
Equation (2-59a) has an estimated scatter of ±30 percent.
2. A linear equation21 for the sjp'o ratio for nc clays was presented earlier in curve form by
Skempton and Henkel (1953, Figs. 8 and 9) which can be approximated from the plots as
sjp'o = 0.11 + 0.0037/p (2-60)
In this equation use Ip in percent and not decimal.
3. Karlsson and Viberg (1967) suggest
sjpfo = 0.5wL wL > 0.20 (2-61)
where the liquid limit WL is a decimal value. This equation has a scatter of about ±30
percent.

All of the preceding equations are for a normally consolidated soil. For design purposes
use as many of these equations as possible and average the several values (unless there is a
large scatter) for a best design value. If there is a substantial scatter in the computed values
give strong consideration to doing some laboratory testing.
A specific methodology termed SHANSEP22 that is based on normalization of select soil
properties has been proposed and used since the mid-1970s at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT). Ladd et al. (1977) give an extensive discussion on normalizing soil
parameters for use in the SHANSEP method.

ESTIMATING THE sulp'o RATIO FOR PRECONSOLIDATED SOILS. The Ladd et al. (1977)
reference also gave a means of estimating the OCR strength, as illustrated in Fig. 2-36, based
on direct simple shear (DSS) tests. The original plot used five soils: three from the northeast-
ern United States, one from Louisiana, and one from Bangkok, Thailand. The liquid limits
(for all but the varved clay) ranged from 41 to 95 percent, and IL ranged from 0.8 to 1.0.
These clays were tested in CA^UDSS at OCR from 1 to large values with the undrained
shear strength su results normalized using the laboratory (or existing) effective overburden
pressure p'o as follows:
Compute A = su>njp'o and B = SM,OCR//^-
Compute B/A and plot this versus OCR.

21 This equation has been attributed to a later Skempton reference by Anderson (1982) and others. It is rounded
somewhat and given by Peck et al. (1974) but attributed to a different source.

organic and highly dessicated (code 2). Code 1 covers five clays, code 2 is same locale but two separate strata,
code 3 is from Oslo, Norway.

It is evident that at OCR = 1 we would obtain B/A = 1 (at least within test limitations).
Also with the overburden pressure p'o the same for both OCR = 1 and OCR > 1, we have
the relationship

B/A = su>OCR/su>nc
The more general form of B/A allows one to use a laboratory value of p'o that may be different
from the field value. The initial curve has only a modest scatter and would appear useful for
almost any clay. Other test data from Mahar and O'Neill (1983) and Simons (1960) have
been plotted by the author onto this curve (codes 2 and 3), and it is evident that both test
procedure23 and type of soil may be significant. The general curve trends are still present and
these curves may be useful for similar soils and the same local test method. This set of curves
will become more valuable as users contribute to the data base so that additional soils with
OCR > 1 can be plotted on it.
This type of curve has two uses, as illustrated by the following examples, which implicitly
assume the solid curves (test code 1 of Fig. (2-25), are representative.

of interest p'o was 50 kPa. From the depth of interest su>nc of a remolded K0 consolidated sample is
60 kPa (consolidation pressure used = p'o = 60).

Required. Estimate the field value of SM,OCR- (One might question why we did not obtain a sample
and measure su directly, but assume for the example we did not.)

Solution. For the normally consolidated case su>nc = 60 kPa. Also, OCR = p'Jp'o = 250/50 = 5.
From Fig. 2-36 obtain B/A = 3.7 (visual interpolation between solid curve lines at OCR = 5).
Thus,
SU,OCR = 3.7Cvnc) = 3.7(60) = 220 kPa (rounded)

Example 2-5.

Given. Same data as in Example 2-4 except we did not do a consolidation test and we did obtain
an average value of SU,OCR = 220 kPa.

Required. Estimate the in situ OCR.

Solution. Compute A = su>nc/p'o = 60/50 = 1.2. Compute B = sUyOcvJp'o = 220/50 = 4.4.
Compute B/A = 4.4/1.2 = 3.7 and enter abscissa of Fig. 2-36 and project to the average of the two
curves and down to obtain OCR = 5.
It is evident that if this latter value of OCR is approximately the in situ value, then Fig. 2-36 has
much value, for this determination of OCR is much less expensive than performing a consolidation
test—unless the consolidation data are needed for settlement studies.

Example 2-6. Redo the OCR part of Example 2-2 and see if Eq. (2-25) has more merit than indi-
cated in that example.

Given.

OCR = 1 (f)' = 20° Ip = 35 percent
OCR = 5 0' = 25° h = 32 percent


Previously found in Example 2-2.
K0>nc = 0.58 KO,OCR = 1.14 and 1.15
and K0>0CR = 0.62 from Eq. (2-25) using 0.58(0.8 + 0.27) = 0.62.

Solution. Here, use Fig. 2-36 with Eq. (2-59) to find su>nc/p'o:
Su,nc/p'o = 0A5(IP)l/2 = 0.45(0.35)1/2 = 0.267
This is also the A in the B/A ratio used in Fig. 2-36.
From Fig. 2-36, using OCR = 5 and the average of the upper four curves, obtain

B/A = 3.5 -> 5/0.267 = 3.5
B = 3.5(.267) = 0.93
Substituting into Eq. (2-25), we have
^0,OCR = 0.58(0.8 + 0.93) = 1.00 (and does not appear unreasonable)
Now the "best" estimate is
1.00+1.15 + 1.14
A-o.OCR = ~ = JL-AU

One would probably use some value between 1.00 and 1.12 since Eq. (2-25) is based on regression
on a large base of reported data and similarly for Fig. 2-36 so that 1.00 may be more nearly correct
than either 1.15 or 1.14. In other words, give this value more "weight" for design.

2-12 SENSITIVITY AND THIXOTROPY
The ratio of the undisturbed shear strength of a cohesive soil to the remolded strength at the
same water content is defined as the sensitivity St:
_ Undisturbed strength
1 ~ Remolded strength
For the unconfined compression test this is

St = ^""disturbed ( 2 - 6 3 « )
Qu, remolded

Clays may be classified as follows:

St Comments
Insensitive < 4 Majority of clays
Sensitive 4 < St < 8
Extrasensitive > 8 Use with caution

Marine and lake clays and organic silts with high water content may have no measurable
remolded strength. In any case, if disturbance causes a significant strength reduction, great


care is required in using the site, since an unanticipated disturbance (perhaps as little as
driving a heavy tractor over it) has the potential of converting the deposit into a viscous fluid.
Thixotropy is the regain of strength from the remolded state with time. AU clays and other
soils containing cementing agents exhibit thixotropic properties. When the strength gain is
from pore-pressure dissipation, this is not thixotropy. Piles driven into a soft clay deposit often
have very little load-carrying capacity until a combination of aging/cementation (thixotropy)
and dissipation of excess pore pressure (consolidation) occurs. Remolded quick clays (St >
16) have been found to recover very little of the original strength in reasonable time lapses
(on the order of under four months [Skempton and Northey (1952)].)

2-13 STRESSPATHS
A stress path is a locus of stress points developed by stress changes in the soil and can be
either obtained from, say, points obtained from Mohr's stress circle or directly computed.
Stress paths can be used to plot stress changes both in laboratory soil samples and in situ.
They have value in giving insight into probable soil response—particularly if a part of the
previous history stress path can be either reproduced or estimated. A careful study of the stress
path concept may lead to a better organized laboratory test program. A particular advantage
of a stress path is that it provides greater clarity than what one obtains from a series of Mohr's
circles, which often overlap.
Stress paths can be plotted in a number of ways; however, the method now most widely
used [apparently first used by Simons (I960)] and later called a stress path by Lambe (1964,
1967) uses p-q coordinates defined on Fig. 2-37. Stress path coordinates may be in terms of
total (TSP) or effective (ESP) values. Since the effective stresses are
<J[ = <j\ — u and o"3 = (J3 — u
on adding and subtracting, respectively, and dividing by 2 we find
p' = p — u and q' — q
Thus, the effective stress path is shifted along the p axis by the pore pressure, which may be
(+) or (-). The pore pressure used above should include the static value us as well as any
excess developed during shear, usually designated AM.
As shown on Fig. 2-37 for test 3(p'3, qf3), the p-q values locate the origin (p) and the di-
ameter (q) of a Mohr's circle. It is evident that 2q = deviator stress at some value of cell
pressure and axial stress in a triaxial test. The q parameter is also the current maximum shear
stress.
Stress path concepts will be illustrated in Figs. 2-37 through 2-41. Figure 2-37 is the stress
path (here the K0 line) as developed in situ for a normally consolidated sedimented deposit.
It must start from q = p = 0 because the first deposition has no overburden pressure and
thus av = ah = 0. Mohr's circles can be plotted as the deposit depth z increases (as partially
shown for clarity) and the locus of p-q points thus traced representing the K0 stress path. Note
that this is an effective stress path from the definition of K0 previously given.
Figure 2-38 is a triaxial CA^UC test of a normally consolidated clay. The K0 consolidation
uses 0-3 = in situ value (obviously somewhat estimated) and increasing a\ to the present
effective overburden value p'o. By definition of K0 consolidation, the excess pore pressure
AM is zero at this point. For the plot we will have adjusted total stresses by the static pore

pressure us, so what is shown are effective stresses. Now as we start the test from the K0 point
we increase the axial stress Acri, which, in undrained compression, produces excess pore
pressures AM. If these Aw values are plotted they produce a TSP24 as shown. By measuring
AM we can plot ESP (or approximate it) with a straight line if we only measure the pore
pressure at peak (failure) stress AM/. The TSP from several tests allows one to draw a best-fit
Kf line and from ESP points a best-fit K* line. These lines represent the ratio of q/p at failure
and for either total or effective stresses and corresponding principal stress values. Observe
the difficulty with data plotting and interpretation for a single test at several load stages in
Fig. 2-38a compared to the relatively clean stress path plots of Fig. 2-38Z?. From this stress
path plot note these features:

1. The path AB' is of little interest here as it merely reproduces the in situ stresses. Its slope
along with the rest of the TSP is 45°. From the graphics shown, it should be evident that
the TSP always has this slope.

ally curved if intermediate values of Aw are obtained. Otherwise there are only the two
endpoints (starting and ending) if only Aw/ is measured.
3. There is usually an intercept a from the Kf line for cohesive soils but a is very nearly
zero for the K'f line for normally consolidated soils and all cohesionless soils. From a
and slope angle a we can compute total shear stress parameters c and <f> as shown on
Fig. 2-38«. We can also compute effective stress parameters in a similar manner. The
distance m is common to both the s line and the Kf line as shown here.

Figure 2-39 A series of CIU triaxial tests on a cohesive soil. This is the usual method of making triaxial tests;
however, pore-pressure measurements are less common.

Figure 2-39 is the more usual case of a consolidated undrained triaxial test that uses
isotropic consolidation (CIU test). Inspection of this and Fig. 2-38 indicates that the prin-
cipal difference between an isotropic and an anisotropic consolidation (aside from the great
difficulty of carrying out the consolidation) is that the CA^U test starts at q > 0 whereas the
CIU test always starts at q = 0 and p = cell pressure ac. In both cases Aw = 0 at the end of
consolidation and the start of applying a stress change. Again the starting point is (or should
be) adjusted for static pore pressure us = ywhw.
Figure 2-40 illustrates the four possibilities for stress changes in a triaxial test and the
corresponding field applications. Observe that point A may be at the end of either isotropic
(shown) or anisotropic consolidation (as point B' of Fig. 2-38). Note that cases 2 and 4 are
not easy since changing ah (if it is a cell pressure) requires simultaneous adjustment of the
axial stress av so that it is kept constant.
These four cases will be quantitatively illustrated in Fig. 2-41 using the numerical data
for the tests as indicated, together with the following comments:

Test L Initial cell pressure a\ = a?, = 470 kPa. Decrease lateral pressure and maintain
constant vertical pressure = 470 kPa (compression test with decreasing lateral pressure).
Sample "fails" at Cr3 = 118 kPa.
Test 2. Initial cell pressure = 470 kPa. Increase vertical pressure with lateral pressure
= 470 kPa (standard compression test). Sample "fails" at Cr1 = 1176 kPa.
Test 3. Initial cell pressure = 470 kPa. Decrease vertical pressure and hold lateral pressure
constant (extension test—decreasing vertical pressure).
Test 4. Initial cell pressure = 470 kPa. Increase horizontal pressure to 1176 kPa and hold
vertical pressure constant (extension test with constant vertical pressure).

From these several plots, it should be evident that the Kf line of slope q/p always inter-
sects the p axis, but may be at a (—)p value (m distance). It should also be evident that this

ESP = effective stress path
TSP = total stress path

Figure 2-40 Four possible stress paths from either compression or extension triaxial tests and the corresponding
field cases. Note that case 1 and case 3 can be duplicated by laboratory tests only with great difficulty as the vertical
stress field changes result in lateral stress changes of some amount K (not K0 or Kf) as shown so that the resulting
stress path is not 45° from horizontal as are cases 2 and 4.

intersection point is also common to the shear stress envelope s because of the Mohr's circle
relationship.
Figure 2-42 illustrates the stress path to produce an overconsolidated cohesive soil using a
consolidation (or oedometer) test as an illustration. This is similar to field overconsolidation
from sedimentation. Steps are as follows:

1. Sample is K0 consolidated at point A under a vertical stress of 50 kPa, which produces a
lateral stress an against the confining ring of Koav = 28 kPa. It is computed or directly
scaled form Mohr's circle as cr3 if the slope of the K0 line is known so that it can be drawn
prior to any Mohr's circles since a 45° slope from a\ (= 50 kPa) intersects K0 at A.
2. Now we add the next load increment of 50 kPa (doubling the stress) so that crv = a\ =
100 kPa. This moves the stress circle at constant diameter laterally along the p axis
50 kPa, because without immediate pore drainage the Ao* i is carried by the pore water
as excess pore pressure Aw = 50 kPa. As drainage occurs, Mohr's circles form with a

locus of TSP points along path BD. The ESP is, of course, along the K0 line from to A to D
(definition of K0). After some time elapses, the p-q coordinates of point D are developed
and consolidation is complete with
av = 100 kPa
ah — Koav = 56 kPa (scaled or computed)
3. We will now remove 50 kPa (leaving a total vertical stress of <JV — 50 kPa). At this point
we have known effective stresses of av = 50 kPa and a "locked in" lateral stress of 56
kPa represented by point E. The stress path from D to E is uncertain because of sample
swell and some slight reduction in lateral stress from ring tension previously developed,
but we can approximate it as shown (or by a straight line). Point E is located using 45°
slopes from av = 50 and cr^ = 56 kPa as shown.

If we then reapplied the 50 kPa stress increment we would traverse the dashed line from E
back to approximately the point D previously located. We say approximately for two reasons:

a. In a consolidation test the ring will expand and contract under lateral stresses from hoop
tension.
b. There are secondary compression (or creep) effects.

In any case, remolded laboratory samples tested in this manner never exactly reproduce the
"preconsolidation" point D. Usually the recovered point is to the right of the original (or below
it on an e versus log p plot).
This unload-reload cycle is similar to recovery of an in situ sample, except sample recov-
ery reduces av to zero and the subsequent application of load increments extends beyond
the original preconsolidation load. In Fig. 2-42 we know the OCR at stage 3 (point E) and
can compute it and the current KOyE, which is not the same as KOt£>. Note that from the figure
^o.nc = 0.56 and for OCR = 2 the overconsolidated value is A^OCR = 1.12. The test proce-
dure here produced the same change in K0 as the OCR. In field soils, secondary compression
and other factors do not maintain this ratio (as previously observed in Sec. 2-8). Another es-
sential consideration is that the static pore pressure us in the lab on a 20-25 mm thick sample
is negligible, where in the field it probably is not.
The use of stress paths will be illustrated in the following example.

Example 2-7.
Given, A square footing 4 m X 4 m overlies a dense sand of y — 20 kN/m3. The footing contact
pressure is qo = 250 kPa. Taking K0 = 0.4 [from Eq. (2-18a)] estimate the stress path at 2-m depth
for a similar triaxial test to obtain strain data for this load e2 so that a settlement increment from 1
to 3 m can be computed as AH2 = e2 (2 m).

Solution. Refer to Fig. E2-7.
1. Plot K0.
2. Compute Aqv>2 from the vertical stress profile of Fig. 1-laaiD/B = 2/4 = 0.5 (D = 0.5B),
Aqv>2 = factor X qo = 0.7(250) = 175 kPa
3. Compute A ^ 2 = KoAqv>2 = 0.4(175) = 7OkPa.

4. Compute initial in situ po and (Th'.

6. The footing stress ^0 increases both the vertical and lateral stresses at this point by the amounts

qe = (40 + 1 7 5 ) - ( 1 6 + 70) = 6 4 5

7. The process of plotting /7 = 28, ^ = 12 (is on K0 line) and endpoints p = 150.5 and q = 64.5
and connecting with a straight line gives the dashed stress path as shown on Fig. E2-7.

2-14 ELASTICPROPERTIESOFSOIL
Hooke's generalized stress-strain law is commonly used in solving geotechnical problems
of stress and settlement. In equation form Hooke's stress-strain law for any homogeneous,
isotropic, elastic material is

ey = —(a-y- fxax - IA(T1) (2-64)

ez = —{az - IX(Jx - IX(Jy)

The signs here are based on using (+) \x of Eq. (b) following.
In matrix notation Eq. (2-64) can be written as
€ = D a (2-64<i)
where the matrix D is the following

D

The shear modulus G' (which may be subscripted) is defined as the ratio of shear stress ss
to shear strain es.25 It is related to Es and /x as

Poisson's ratio /x is used in both pressure and settlement studies and is defined as the ratio
of axial compression ev to lateral expansion ei strains, or

M = ^ (W
The /x ratio has a (+) sign in this equation if ev is compressive strain and the lateral strain
€L causes the lateral dimension to increase. In a tension test the sign is (+) if the sample ev
produces elongation while the lateral dimension(s) decrease. The shearing strain es is de-
fined as the change in right angle of any corner of an element in compression as illustrated in

25The shear modulus in structural mechanics literature often uses the symbol G,-, where i may be s = steel; c =
concrete; etc. Since Gs is used in geotechnical work for the specific gravity of the soil solids, the closest symbol to
the "literature" is G'.

Another concept occasionally used is the volumetric strain, e^ defined using initial mass
volume V and volumetric change A V as
AV
ev = — = ei + e 2 + 63 (d)
The subscripts x, y, and z may be substituted for 1, 2, and 3 in this equation.
In confined compression tests (such as the consolidation test described in Sec. 2-10 or
for the compression beneath the tip of a pile in situ) the lateral strain (62, €3) is taken as
0.0. Making these substitutions in Eqs. (2-64) and solving for 61 = ev, one can obtain the
following:
_ (1 + IJi)(I - 2/X)CJ1 1 - 2/1 0-1
Es(l - fi) 2(1 - fi) G' K6)
Since this textbook uses the z axis as the vertical axis, you may use az for a\ in this equation.
Of interest is that for /JL = 0.5, this equation gives the volumetric strain ev = 0.0; i.e., there
is no volume change in the soil. Also, for /x = 0 the volumetric strain is ev = ajEs = ez.
The volumetric strain was used to plot e versus log p of Fig. 2-\6b.

For an elastic material the shear modulus G' cannot be ( - ) , so Eq. (a) sets the lower limit of
/JL > -1. Equation if) sets the upper limit at /JL < 0.5. It appears that the range of /i for soils
(that are not "elastic") is from about -0.1 to 1.00. Table 2-7 gives a range of values for select
materials. It is very common to use the following values for soils:

ft Soil type

0.4-0.5 Most clay soils
0.45-0.50 Saturated clay soils
0.3-0.4 Cohesionless—medium and dense
0.2-0.35 Cohesionless—loose to medium

Although it is common to use /JL = 0.5 for saturated clay soils, the reader should be aware
that this represents a condition of no volume change under the applied stress az. Over time,
however, volume change does occur as the pore fluid drains. Equation (e) defines the Poisson's
ratio that develops initially (ev = 0) and also later when ev > 0. Since the strain is produced
from stress and Fig. 1-1 indicates a vertical variation, it necessarily follows that /JL is stress-
dependent from Eq. (e).
A special case in geotechnical work is that of plane strain. This arises where strains occur
parallel to two of the coordinate axes (say the x and z) but the strain is zero perpendicular
to the x-z plane (along the y axis). If we set ey = 0 in the set of equations for Hooke's law
[(Eqs. (2-64)] and solve for the resulting values of E5 and /JL, we obtain the following:

(2-65)


If we take /JL = 0.5 and solve for the plane strain value /i',we have

^ l - / x ( 1 - 0 . 5 )
which is greater than the "elastic" value of 0.5. The plane strain /JL' should be used in plane
strain problems—and with E's if applicable.
The modulus of sub grade reaction (also subgrade modulus or subgrade reaction) is de-
fined as (see Fig. 2-43c)
ks = £ (2-66)
where Aa is the increment of contact pressure and AS is the corresponding change in set-
tlement or deformation. These data can be obtained from a plate (or footing) load test and a
plot drawn as Fig. 2-43c. The 5 versus a plot is generally not linear, and one must obtain ks
as the slope of either a tangent or secant line. Either a tangent (solid line) or secant (dashed)
line slope of Fig. 2-43c can be used for ks. Usually, initial values (through the origin) are
used; however, one can choose any tangent point or an averaged value using the two points
cut by a secant line along the curve. The secant slope defined by the origin (S = 0) and at
S = 0.0254 m (25 mm or 1 in.) giving AS = 0.0254 m is recommended as an initial selection
for Eq. (2-66).
The stress-strain modulus E8, Poisson's ratio /A, and the modulus of subgrade reaction ks
are the elastic properties of most interest. These values are commonly used in computing
estimates of foundation settlements. The shear modulus G' is commonly used in vibration
problems of Chap. 20 to estimate foundation frequency and displacement amplitudes.
The stress-strain modulus can be obtained from the slope (tangent or secant) of stress-
strain curves from triaxial tests (see Figs. 2-43a and 2-32). It is often estimated from field
tests that are described in Chap. 3 (see also Table 5-6). Typical value ranges for several soils
are given in Table 2-8. It can be seen that Es for soils is only Mo to Moo that of steel and
concrete.
For the CD or CU triaxial test with a cell pressure of a3 and a deviator stress Ao-I =
0"i ~ 0"3 (the pressure applied at various load stages during the test) we may rewrite one of
Eq. (2-64), sayez = 61, as

€1 = ^r(Ao-! -2/JLa3) (g)
Jb8
It is usual to plot €1 (computed directly as Ao-\/L) versus Ao"i as shown in Fig. 2-43a. From
this plot we should be able to solve Eq. (g) above for both E8 and /JL by taking several pairs
of points along the curve such that the curve slope is approximately constant in the interval
between point pairs. If we do this, we find that /JL > 0.5 at very small strains and that both
E8 and /JL are stress-dependent. Of course, we could directly inspect Fig. 2-43a and readily
observe that if the curve is not linear, then the stress-strain modulus E8 is not linear. This result
again gives reason to term the curve "slope" the stress-strain modulus, and not the modulus
of elasticity.
Equation (g) also gives clear reason why unconfined compression tests with 0 - 3 = 0 give
larger strains (and smaller E8) than confined compression tests. Since the soil is "confined"

* Value range is too large to use an "average" value for design.

in situ, it is reasonable for confined compression tests to produce better "elastic" parameters.
Although it is difficult to compare laboratory and field E5 values, there is some evidence that
field values are often four to five times larger than laboratory values from the unconfined
compression test. For this reason, current practice tends to try to obtain "field" values from in
situ testing whenever possible. This topic will be taken up in more detail in the next chapter.
Table 2-8 gives a range of Es values that might be obtained. Note that the range is very
large, owing to the foregoing factors as well as those factors given on the table. With this
wide range of values the reader should not try to use "averaged" values from this table for
design.
If laboratory test plots similar to Fig. 2-43a are used, it is most common to use the initial
tangent modulus to compute the stress-strain modulus Es for the following reasons:

1. Soil is elastic only near the origin.
2. There is less divergence between all plots in this region.
3. The largest values are obtained—often three to five times larger than a tangent or secant
modulus from another point along the curve.


In spite of these several shortcomings for Es the value along the curve is commonly used
in finite-element analyses based on the computed stress level. This computation may require
that the problem be iterated several times until the computed stress level matches the stress
level that was used on the previous cycle to obtain Es.
A number of investigators [Leonards (1968), Soderman et al. (1968), Makhlouf and Stew-
art (1965), Larew and Leonards (1962)] have suggested that a better initial tangent modulus
for settlement analyses might be obtained by cycling the deviator stress Acri to about half
the estimated failure stress several times [Leonards (1968) suggests at least five cycles] and
then compressing the sample to failure in the CU triaxial test. The initial tangent modulus
(may be called Er) by this method may be three to five times larger than Es obtained on the
first cycle (see Fig. 2-43a). The increase in stiffness depends on the initial soil state and on
sample disturbance. This stress-strain modulus is a static value.
Cyclic tests using low-amplitude strains and frequencies (or stress reversals) in the range
of g to 10 Hz are used to obtain dynamic values of Es and G'. The dynamic values (considered
in more detail in Chap. 20) may be from two to ten times the static value.
Both Es and Poisson's ratio /JL are heavily dependent on the following:

1. Method of laboratory test (confined, unconfined, undrained, drained).
2. Degree of confinement. Es increases from a minimum value in the unconfined compression
test to very large values depending on cell pressure ac.
3. Overconsolidation ratio OCR—usually increases with OCR.
4. Soil density—Es usually increases with depth in situ because the density usually increases
(in the same stratum).
5. Water content—lower water contents tend to higher Es. Brittle fractures at low strains
occur at low water contents.
6. Strain rate (e/time)—Es is lower by a factor of 2 or more compared with values obtained
at high strain rates [see Richardson and Whitman (1963)]. Field strain rates are usually,
but not always, lower than in the laboratory.
7. Sample disturbance—usually reduces Es from in situ value.

These several factors mean that considerable judgment is required to obtain a reasonably
reliable value for design use.
The stress-strain curve for all soils is nonlinear except in a very narrow region near the
origin. Kondner (1963) proposed that the stress-strain curve (Fig. 2-AAa) could be represented
by a hyperbolic equation of the form
e
0*1 - (73 = —T-
a + be
which could be rewritten with ACJJ = cr\ - a3 in linear form as
-^- = a + be (2-67)

Note the similarity of Eq. (2-67) to Eq. (2-47). The left side of Eq. (2-67) can be computed for
various values of deviator stress and the corresponding strain to make a linear plot as shown
in Fig. 2-AAb. Extension of the plot across the discontinuity at e —> 0 gives the coefficient


Figure 2-44 (a) Usual stress-strain plot—hyperbolic-curve approximation; (b) transformed representation of
stress-strain—gives approximate linear curve as shown. [After Kondner (1963).].

a, and the slope is b. Although Kondner proposed this procedure for clay soils, it should be
applicable for all soils with similar stress-strain curves [see Duncan and Chang (1970)]. The
form of Eq. (2-67) rearranged and shown on Fig. 2-AAb has particular value in finite-element
method (FEM) analyses since it is much easier to program an equation to compute Es based
on current output e than to make a search along a stress-strain curve (using a number of values
of e versus Acn input as an array). Computation time is greatly reduced when a large number
of elements are in the FEM model.
The following empirical correlations may be used to estimate Es for cohesive soils:

Normally consolidated sensitive clay:
Es = (200 to 500) X su (2-68)
Normally consolidated insensitive and lightly overconsolidated clay:
Es = (750 to 1200) X su (2-69)
Heavily overconsolidated clay
Es = (1500 to 2000) X su (2-70)

Several equations will be presented in the next chapter, based on in situ testing, that may also
be used for both cohesive and cohesionless soils to compute Es.

2-15 ISOTROPIC AND ANISOTROPIC SOIL MASSES
An isotropic material is one in which the elastic properties (E5 and /UL) are the same in all
directions. The elastic properties for anisotropic materials are different in the different direc-
tions. A material is homogeneous when the physical and compositional properties such as y,
void ratio, and silt or clay content are the same throughout the volume of interest.
Almost all naturally occurring soil deposits are anisotropic and nonhomogeneous. The
anisotropy is produced from a combination of particle placement during deposition/formation
(also called geometrical or inherent anisotropy) and from overburden pressures. In natural
soils this commonly results in horizontal bedding planes that have both strength and elastic

properties different for samples stressed perpendicular and parallel to the bedding planes.
This property of anisotropy has been known for some time [Casagrande and Carrillo (1944)],
but only more recently have attempts been made to quantify the effects [see Yong and Silvestri
(1979), Law and Lo (1976), Arthur and Menzies (1972), and Yamada and Ishihara (1979)].
Figure 2-45 illustrates anisotropy and the possible range in strength that occurs when the
stress orientation is at some angle with respect to the bedding plane. This figure should also be
compared with Fig. 2-25 to see how anisotropy can qualitatively affect in situ shear resistance
depending on the intersection angle between the bedding plane and the potential shear plane.
Nonhomogeneous deposits are produced from particle packing versus depth, mass contam-
ination during deposition, and lenses or strata of different materials in the depth of interest.
The increase in particle packing and confining pressure with depth nearly always produces
a stress-strain modulus increase in depth, which is usually nonlinear. It has been common,
however, to assume a soil mass is semi-infinite, homogeneous, and isotropic, even in layered
deposits, as a computational convenience. The current state-of-art is such that a soil mass can
be somewhat more realistically modeled than this, albeit at some additional time and expense.
Anisotropy is an important consideration in finite-element analyses of soils, since elastic
properties are input parameters. Where two elastic constants define the stress-strain relation-
ship [Eq. (2-64)] of an isotropic material, five constants are required when a homogeneous soil
is deposited in layers so that one can assume symmetry about a vertical axis. A soil deposit
that meets this criterion is termed cross-anisotropic. Strictly, a soil is not cross-anisotropic
because of depth variations, but this simplification, which may not introduce serious compu-
tational errors, has the effect of reducing 21 elastic constants of the general case to seven.
The seven elastic constants for a cross-anisotropic material (actually only five are indepen-
dent) are defined as follows (the x-zplane ofisotropy is horizontal and the y axis is vertical):
Ey = stress-strain modulus in the vertical direction
EH = stress-strain modulus in the horizontal plane, i.e., in the plane ofisotropy
JX\ = ejex when the applied stress is ax
№ = ^xMy when the applied stress is ay
/^3 = €y/ex when the applied stress is ax
G'H = shear modulus in the horizontal plane


Gy = shear modulus in the vertical plane
T( = shear stress on /-plane

But

°H ~ 2(1 + M l )

and

So the five elastic constants for a cross-anisotropic material are G'v, Ey, EH, /JL\, and ^-
A more detailed discussion on cross-anisotropic behavior of soil deposits can be found in
Bhatacharya(1968).
The generalized Hooke's law for cross-anisotropic material takes the following form:
(Tx (Ty (Jz

By substituting Eq. (c) in Eqs. (£>), using Eq. (a) to obtain ^ 3 , and noting that yxz = 7 ^ =
0, the following form of the generalized Hooke's law for cross-anisotropic material in plane
strain is obtained:

where

(d)


Thus, for plane-strain problems of cross-anisotropic materials it is only necessary to know
the four parameters A, B, C, and Gy, which can be determined [Chowdhury (1972)] as fol-
lows:

1. Perform a set of plane-strain triaxial tests with a constant cell pressure on a sample with
the plane of isotropy horizontal.
2. Plot the deviator stress versus axial strain.
3. Plot the deviator stress versus lateral strain. The lateral strain can be computed from the
axial strain and volume-change measurements.
4. Compute \/B = slope of curve of step 3.
1/C = slope of curve of step 2.
5. Perform a plane-strain triaxial test with a constant cell pressure on a sample with the plane
of isotropy vertical such that the direction of plane strain is parallel to the plane of isotropy.
6. Plot steps 2 and 3 above to obtain a second set of curves.
7. Compute \/B = slope of curve of step 3 (should check reasonably with
step 4).
I/A = slope of curve of step 2.
8. Test a sample with the plane of isotropy inclined at 45° to the horizontal (samples may be
difficult to obtain except from a test pit).
9. Plot the deviator stress versus axial strain. The slope da/de of this curve is related to Gy
by the following equation:

Gy = 4/slope - (A - IB + C) ^
Thus, the four constants required to solve the plane-strain problems of cross-anisotropic
soil can be obtained from three sets of plane-strain triaxial tests; one set of tests is on soil
samples with the plane of isotropy horizontal; the second set is on samples with the plane of
isotropy vertical; and the third set is on samples with the plane of isotropy 45° inclined to
the horizontal. Effective or total stresses may be used as appropriate, but all values should be
consistent. Since the value of Gy is particularly critical [Raymond (1970)], all four constants
A, B, C, and Gy must be correctly determined if one wants to consider the cross anisotropy of
the soil. If the correct evaluation of each of the four constants is not possible, the soil should
be treated as an isotropic material.

Hence, the D matrix for plane-strain problems of cross-anisotropic materials is

3-1 DATA REQUIRED
Investigation of the underground conditions at a site is prerequisite to the economical design
of the substructure elements. It is also necessary to obtain sufficient information for feasibility
and economic studies for a proposed project. Public building officials may require soil data
together with the recommendations of the geotechnical consultant prior to issuing a building
permit, particularly if there is a chance that the project will endanger the public health or
safety or degrade the environment.
To eliminate the site exploration, which usually ranges from about 0.5 to 1.0 percent of
total construction costs, only to find after construction has started that the foundation must be
redesigned, is certainly false economy. This fact is generally recognized, and it is doubtful
that any major structures are currently designed without site exploration being undertaken.
Small structures are sometimes designed without site exploration; however, the practice is
not recommended. The condition of the adjacent structures is an indication, but certainly no
guarantee, that a site is satisfactory.
Suitable building sites in urban areas are becoming difficult to find, and often sites targeted
for urban renewal are used. These sites can be quite hazardous from demolition of previously
existing structures and backfilling of former basements during landscaping. Often this type
of backfill is done with little supervision or quality control, so there can be significant soil
variation at these sites within a few meters in any direction.
The elements of a site investigation depend heavily on the project but generally should
provide the following:

1. Information to determine the type of foundation required (shallow or deep).
2. Information to allow the geotechnical consultant to make a recommendation on the allow-
able load capacity of the foundation.

EXPLORATION, SAMPLING, AND
IN SITU SOIL MEASUREMENTS

CHAPTER
3


3. Sufficient data/laboratory tests to make settlement predictions.
4. Location of the groundwater table (or determination of whether it is in the construction
zone). For certain projects, groundwater table fluctuations may be required. These can
require installation of piezometers and monitoring of the water level in them over a period
of time.
5. Information so that the identification and solution of construction problems (sheeting and
dewatering or rock excavation) can be made.
6. Identification of potential problems (settlements, existing damage, etc.) concerning adja-
cent property.
7. Identification of environmental problems and their solution.

An exploration program may be initiated on an existing structure where additions are con-
templated. The current safety of an existing structure may require investigation if excessive
settlements or cracks have occurred. The required remedial measures may be undertaken
based on new-found information or on the damage evidence and a reinterpretation of the
original data.
Part of the geotechnical program may include on-site monitoring, both during and after
construction, to make certain that recommendations are being followed. Where excavation
reveals conditions requiring design changes, monitoring of progress will ensure that change
orders are initiated early enough to keep costs to a minimum. Postconstruction monitoring
of building performance is particularly desirable from the geotechnical consultant's view,
since this allows for a review of the design procedures and builds a database for future work.
Unfortunately, few owners are willing to make this investment or even allow property entry
should the foundation consultant be willing to underwrite the cost.
Although the primary focus of this chapter is on site exploration for buildings and other
structures where the cost per unit area is high (compact site), many of the methods are ap-
plicable to roads; airfields; water, sewer, pipe, and power lines; and other extended sites.
Extended site exploration is useful to establish line and grade, locate groundwater level and
rock line, delineate zones of poor-quality soil, and establish borrow pits.

3-2 METHODS OF EXPLORATION
The most widely used method of subsurface investigation for compact sites as well as for
most extended sites is boring holes into the ground, from which samples may be collected for
either visual inspection or laboratory testing. Several procedures are commonly used to drill
the holes and to obtain the soil samples. These will be taken up in more detail later.
Generally we may categorize the site exploration as in Table 3-1, where disturbed or undis-
turbed samples are collected. On the basis of preliminary borings (or prior site knowledge)
a decision is made whether to base additional site design information on in situ tests or to
recover "undisturbed" samples for laboratory tests or, in the usual case, to use a combination.
Table 3-2 lists the wide variety of in situ tests currently available. Prior to 1960 this
list would have included only the standard penetration test (SPT), the mechanical cone test
(CPT), vane shear test, and plate load test. Many of the devices listed here have been de-
veloped since the early 1970s. Some are new and others, such as several of the "cones," are
claimed improvements on the original mechanical cone. Many of the test methods and equip-

ment have only a very limited number of users, and some are little beyond the development
stage.
A summary such as this is useful, however, since needs are often sudden and require an al-
most instant solution. From this list one has several choices in making an in situ determination
of any of the desired engineering design parameter(s).
The more widely used in situ test methods given in Table 3-2 will be described in some de-
tail. For information on those less widely used or still somewhat in development, the reader is
referred to the cited reference (which usually contains a large reference list that will be useful
for a starting point). Also of interest would be the ASCE Geotechnical Special Publication
No. 6: Use of In Situ Tests in Geotechnical Engineering (1986), footnoted in Table 3-2.

3-3 PLANNING THE EXPLORATION PROGRAM
The purpose of the exploration program is to determine the stratification and engineering
properties of the soils underlying the site. The principal properties of interest will be the
strength, deformation, and hydraulic characteristics. The program should be planned so that
the maximum amount of information can be obtained at minimum cost.
It may be more economical to provide a conservative foundation design than to expend
large sums on an elaborate exploration and testing program. On the other hand, sufficient

exploration should be undertaken so that the geotechnical consultant is not in the position of
making an expensive recommendation to protect against uncertainties that could have been
detected by a reasonable program. It should be understood that an overly conservative rec-
ommendation made by the consultant for the sole purpose of self-protection after an adequate
exploration has been undertaken is not ethical.

If the soil is highly erratic, there should only be sufficient borings to establish a general
picture of the underground conditions. An extensive boring (and laboratory testing) program
is not justified in erratic soils, and the final design should be conservatively based on the
properties of the poorer soils. Again, a question of ethics is involved if an excessive number
of borings are taken under these circumstances, unless specifically requested by the client.
In planning the program the foundation consultant must have a good knowledge of current
and accepted methods of both field exploration and laboratory testing and their limitations. A
competent consultant will also have sufficient understanding of equipment function and soil
behavior to make adjustments so that nonstandard equipment or test methods can be used (if
necessary) to obtain the desired information.
In planning the program full advantage should be taken of any existing information, in-
cluding the geotechnical engineer's own database for the area. It is obviously most helpful
to have done site exploration on adjacent sites, or at least in the general area. It will also
be most advantageous to have made the initial borings if this is a part of a detailed site ex-
ploration follow-up from an earlier feasibility study. Even if the consultant does not have
a database from which to work, considerable information on underground conditions may
exist—particularly in urban areas—in various government and utility offices, the owner's
files, or the files of the engineer/architect who has retained the geotechnical consultant. In
any case the borings should be used for a correlation and extension of the existing database
if at all possible. In an undeveloped area where no database currently exists the program is
in fact exploratory.
The actual planning of a subsurface exploration program includes some or all of the fol-
lowing steps:

1. Assembly of all available information on dimensions, column spacing, type and use of the
structure, basement requirements, any special architectural considerations of the proposed
building, and tentative location on the proposed site. Foundation regulations in the local
building code should be consulted for any special requirements.
For bridges the soil engineer should have access to type and span lengths as well as
pier loadings and their tentative location. This information will indicate any settlement
limitations and can be used to estimate foundation loads.
2. Reconnaissance of the area. This may be in the form of a field trip to the site, which can re-
veal information on the type and behavior of adjacent structures such as cracks, noticeable
sags, and possibly sticking doors and windows. The type of local existing structures may
influence to a considerable extent the exploration program and the best type of foundation
for the proposed adjacent structure. Since nearby existing structures must be maintained
in their "as is" condition, excavations or construction vibrations will have to be carefully
controlled, and this can have considerable influence on the "type" of foundation that can
be used.
Erosion in existing cuts (or ditches) may also be observed, but this information may
be of limited use in the foundation analysis of buildings. For highways, however, runoff
patterns, as well as soil stratification to the depth of the erosion or cut, may be observed.
Rock outcrops may give an indication of the presence or the depth of bedrock.
The reconnaissance may also be in the form of a study of the various sources of infor-
mation available, some of which include the following:


Geological maps. Either U.S. government or state geological survey maps.
Agronomy maps. Published by the Department of Agriculture (U.S., state, or other gov-
ernmental agency).
Aerial photographs. Investigator may require special training to interpret soil data, but
the nonspecialist can easily recognize terrain features.
Water and/or oil well logs.
Hydrological data. Data collected by the U.S. Corps of Engineers on streamflow data,
tide elevations, and flood levels.
Soil manuals by state departments of transportation.
State (or local) university publications. These are usually engineering experiment sta-
tion publications. Information can be obtained from the state university if it is not known
whether a state study has been undertaken and published.
3. A preliminary site investigation. In this phase a few borings (one to about four) are made
or a test pit is opened to establish in a general manner the stratification, types of soil to be
expected, and possibly the location of the groundwater table. If the initial borings indicate
that the upper soil is loose or highly compressible, one or more borings should be taken
to rock or competent strata. This amount of exploration is usually the extent of the site
investigation for small structures.
A feasibility exploration program should include enough site data and sample recovery
to establish an approximate foundation design and identify the construction procedures.
Certain construction procedures (sheeting, bracing, tiebacks, slurry walls, rock excava-
tion, dewatering, etc.) can represent a very significant part of the foundation cost and
should be identified as early as practical.
It is common at this stage to limit the recovery of good-quality samples to only three or
four for laboratory testing. These tests, together with strength and settlement correlations
using index properties such as liquid limit, plasticity index, and penetration test data as
well as unconfined compression tests on disturbed samples recovered during penetration
testing, are usually adequate for determining if the site is suitable.
4. A detailed site investigation. Where the preliminary site investigation has established the
feasibility and overall project economics, a more detailed exploration program is under-
taken. The preliminary borings and data are used as a basis for locating additional borings,
which should be confirmatory in nature, and determining the additional samples required.
Note that if the soil is relatively uniformly stratified, a rather orderly spacing of bor-
ings at locations close to critical superstructure elements should be made (requires client
furnish the necessary location data). On occasion additional borings will be required to
delineate zones of poor soil, rock outcrops, fills, and other areas that can influence the
design and construction of the foundation.
Sufficient additional soil samples should be recovered to refine the design and for any
unusual construction procedure required by the contractor to install the foundation. These
samples allow the foundation engineer and contractor to avoid an excessive (uncertainty
factor) bid for the foundation work, cost overruns, and/or damage to adjacent property
owners from unanticipated soil conditions discovered when the excavation is opened.
In the detailed program phase it is generally considered good practice to extend at
least one boring to competent rock if the overlying soil is soft to medium stiff. This is
particularly true if the structure is multiple-storied or requires settlement control.


3-4 SOIL BORING
Exploratory holes into the soil may be made by hand tools, but more commonly truck- or
trailer-mounted power tools are used.

Hand Tools
The earliest method of obtaining a test hole was to excavate a test pit using a pick and shovel.
Because of economics, the current procedure is to use power excavation equipment such as
a backhoe to excavate the pit and then to use hand tools to remove a block sample or shape
the site for in situ testing. This is the best method at present for obtaining quality undisturbed
samples or samples for testing at other than vertical orientation (see Fig. 2-45). For small
jobs, where the sample disturbance is not critical, hand or powered augers (Fig. 3-1) held by
one or two persons can be used. Hand-augered holes can be drilled to depths of about 35 m,
although depths greater than about 8 to 10 m are usually not practical. Commonly, depths
are on the order of 2 to 5 m, as on roadways or airport runways, or investigations for small
buildings.

Mounted Power Drills
For numerous borings to greater depths and to collect samples that are undisturbed, the only
practical method is to use power-driven equipment. Wash boring is a term used to describe
one of the more common methods of advancing a hole into the ground. A hole is started
by driving casing (Fig. 3-2) to a depth of 2 to 3.5 m. Casing is simply a pipe that supports
the hole, preventing the walls from sloughing off or caving in. The casing is cleaned out by
means of a chopping bit fastened to the lower end of the drill rod. Water is pumped through
the drill rod and exits at high velocity through holes in the bit. The water rises between the
casing and drill rod, carrying suspended soil particles, and overflows at the top of the casing
through a T connection into a container, from which the effluent is recirculated back through
the drill rod. The hole is advanced by raising, rotating, and dropping the bit into the soil at the
bottom of the hole. Drill rods, and if necessary casing, are added as the depth of the boring
increases. Usually 6 m or less of casing is required at a hole site. This method is quite rapid
for advancing holes in all but very hard soil strata. Wash boring is more widely used in South
America, Africa, and Asia than in Europe, Australia, or North America.
Rotary drilling is another method of advancing test holes. This method uses rotation of the
drill bit, with the simultaneous application of pressure to advance the hole. Rotary drilling is
the most rapid method of advancing holes in rock unless it is badly fissured; however, it can
also be used for any type of soil. Drilling mud may be used in soils where the sides of the
hole tend to cave in. Drilling mud is usually a water solution of a thixotropic clay (such as
bentonite1), with or without other admixtures, that is forced into the sides of the hole by the
rotating drill. The mud cake thus formed provides sufficient strength in conjunction with the
hydrostatic pressure of the mud suspension (p ~ 1.1 to 1.2 g/cm3) against the wall and soil
"arching" so that the cavity is maintained. The mud pressure also tends to seal off the water

flow into the hole from any permeable water-bearing strata. Various drill heads are available,
such as auger heads for shallow highway and borrow pit exploration, grinding heads for soil
and rock, and coring bits for taking cores from rock as well as from concrete and asphalt
pavements.
Continuous-flight augers with a rotary drill2 are probably the most popular method of soil
exploration at present (Fig. 3-3) in North America, Europe, and Australia. The flights act

as a screw conveyor to bring the soil to the surface. The method is applicable in all soils,
although in saturated sand under several feet of hydrostatic pressure the sand tends to flow
into the lead sections of the auger, requiring a washdown prior to sampling. Borings up to
nearly 100 m can be made with these devices, depending on the driving equipment, soil, and
auger diameter.
The augers may be hollow-stem or solid with the hollow-stem type generally preferred,
as penetration testing or tube sampling may be done through the stem. For obvious reasons,
borings do not have to be cased using continuous-flight augers, and this feature is a decided
economic advantage over other boring methods.
Continuous-flight augers are available in nominal 1- to 1.5-m section lengths (with rapid
attachment devices to produce the required boring depth) and in several diameters including
the following:

Solid stem
OD, mm 67 83 102 115 140 152 180
Hollow stem
ID/OD,mm 64/160 70/180 75/205 90/230 100/250 127/250 152/305

Inspection of this list of auger diameters indicates that a wide range of tube sample diam-
eters may be used in sample recovery. Tube samples are generally limited to about 100-mm
diameter, however, to obtain the best balance between sample quality and cost of drilling the
hole.
The actual hole diameter will be on the order of 12 mm larger than the auger size. In
practice a cutting head is attached to an auger flight, with or without a head plug depending
on the soil; and the hole is advanced with top sections added as required. At the desired depth
the plug is removed (if used), a penetration test is performed, and/or a tube sample recovered.
If a plug is not used, soil cuttings that have accumulated at the bottom have to be removed
so that the test can be made or a sample recovered. Caution should be exercised in removing
the plug below the water table, since a difference in water level inside and outside the auger
stem may create a temporary quick condition in the base soil until the water level stabilizes
inside the auger stem.
Percussion drilling is still another method of forming a hole. In this method the drill is
lifted, rotated slightly, and dropped onto the bottom of the hole. Water is circulated to bring
the soil cuttings to the ground surface; casing is required as well as a pump to circulate the
water.

3-5 SOIL SAMPLING
The most important engineering properties for foundation design are strength, compressibil-
ity, and permeability. Reasonably good estimates of these properties for cohesive soils can
be made by laboratory tests on undisturbed samples, which can be obtained with moderate
difficulty. It is nearly impossible to obtain a truly undisturbed sample of soil, so in general
usage the term undisturbed means a sample where some precautions have been taken to min-
imize disturbance of the existing soil skeleton. In this context, the quality of an "undisturbed"
sample varies widely between soil laboratories. The following represent some of the factors


that make an undisturbed sample hard to obtain:

1. The sample is always unloaded from the in situ confining pressures, with some unknown
resulting expansion. Lateral expansion occurs into the sides of the borehole, so in situ
tests using the hole diameter as a reference are "disturbed" an unknown amount. This is
the reason K0 field tests are so difficult.
2. Samples collected from other than test pits are disturbed by volume displacement of the
tube or other collection device. The presence of gravel greatly aggravates sample distur-
bance.
3. Sample friction on the sides of the collection device tends to compress the sample during
recovery. Most sample tubes are (or should be) swaged so that the cutting edge is slightly
smaller than the inside tube diameter to reduce the side friction.
4. There are unknown changes in water content depending on recovery method and the pres-
ence or absence of water in the ground or borehole.
5. Loss of hydrostatic pressure may cause gas bubble voids to form in the sample.
6. Handling and transporting a sample from the site to the laboratory and transferring the
sample from sampler to testing machine disturb the sample more or less by definition.
7. The quality or attitude of drilling crew, laboratory technicians, and the supervising engi-
neer may be poor.
8. On very hot or cold days, samples may dehydrate or freeze if not protected on-site. Fur-
thermore, worker attitudes may deteriorate in temperature extremes.

Cohesionless Soil Sampling
It is nearly impossible to obtain undisturbed samples of cohesionless material for strength
testing. Sometimes samples of reasonable quality can be obtained using thin-walled piston
samplers in medium- to fine-grained sands. In gravelly materials, and in all dense materials,
samples with minimal disturbance are obtained only with extreme difficulty. Dilation occurs
in dense sands as a combination of volume displacement of the sampler and any pieces of
gravel that catch on its cutting edge to give a larger apparent volume. Some attempts have
been made to recover cohesionless materials by freezing the soil, freezing a zone around the
sample (but not the sample), or injecting asphalt that is later dissolved from the sample; but
most commonly thin-walled piston samplers are used to obtain "undisturbed" samples. A
survey of freezing methods and an analysis of an attempt at frozen-sample recovery is given
by Singh et al. (1982).
A test pit may be used to recover a quality sample, but the large amount of hand work will
make it difficult to justify the expense. The devices shown in Fig. 3-4 can be used to recover
disturbed samples from a boring for visual classification, sieve analyses, and chemical tests.
The primary use of "undisturbed" cohesionless samples is to obtain the unit weight y or
relative density Dr. The weight of soil in the known volume of the sampler allows a reason-
able determination of unit weight, even if the sample has been later disturbed by transporting
it from the site to the laboratory. An attempt to transfer a cohesionless sample from a tube
to a testing machine for strength determination is not likely to meet with much success. A
sample rebuilt in the laboratory to the in situ weight is lacking in both natural cementation


Figure 3-4 Special sampling tools.

and anisotropy, which are significant factors in both strength and permeability estimates for
most soil deposits.
Some geotechnical laboratories are of the opinion that anisotropic samples can be built
to duplicate the in situ state and that the samples can be "aged" to recover some natural
cementation. Even assuming this can be done, few projects could justify the expense for the
small increase obtained in confidence level.
Since it is nearly impossible to recover undisturbed samples from cohesionless deposits,
density, strength, and compressibility estimates are usually obtained from penetration tests
or other in situ methods. Permeability may be estimated from well pumping tests or, approx-
imately, by bailing the boring and observing the time for the water level to rise some amount.

Disturbed Sampling of AU Soils
Disturbed samples are adequate to locate suitable borrow, where compaction characteristics
and index tests for classification are usually sufficient. In this case a larger-diameter auger
(usually only shallow depths) may be used so that bags of representative soil may be obtained
for laboratory compaction tests, sieve analyses, and Atterberg limits.
In recognizing the difficulty and resulting expense of obtaining undisturbed samples,
it is common practice on most foundation projects to rely on penetration tests and, de-
pending on the method, recovery of disturbed samples for obtaining an estimate of the
soil conditions. The standard penetration test (SPT) of Sec. 3-7 is nearly universally used,

even though highly disturbed samples are recovered. Other types of tests, particularly cones,
are also widely used, although these latter devices do not recover a soil sample. For very
complex projects, more than one type of test equipment may be used (such as the standard
penetration test together with a cone penetration test).
Figure 3-5 illustrates the sampling device (also called a split spoon) most commonly used
with the SPT. It is made up of a driving shoe, to ensure a reasonable service life from driving
into the soil, and a barrel. The barrel consists of a piece of tube split lengthwise (split spoon)
with a coupling on the upper end to connect the drill rod to the surface. Inserts (see Fig. 3-5c)
are used when samples of thin mud and sand are to be recovered.
Some split spoons of the type shown in Fig. 3-5 have provision for a liner that contains
the soil sample from a test. At present this method of obtaining a soil sample for laboratory
testing is little used, primarily because the recovered sample is excessively disturbed.
In a test the sampler is driven into the soil a measured distance, using some kind of falling
weight producing some number of blows (or drops). The number of blows Af to drive the
specified distance is recorded as an indication of soil strength.
The sampler is then slightly twisted to shear the soil at the base of the tube and withdrawn.
The shoe and coupling are unscrewed and the two halves of the barrel are opened to expose the
sample (unless a liner is used). If a liner is used, both ends are sealed—usually with melted
wax—for later laboratory testing. If a liner is not used, on-site unconfined compression qu
tests are routinely made on cohesive samples. The wall thickness of the driving shoe (Fig.
3-5a) indicates that any samples recovered by this device are likely to be highly disturbed.
Representative samples from the soil in the sampler barrel are stored in sample jars and
returned to the laboratory for inspection and classification. The field technician marks the jar
with the job and boring number, sample depth, and penetration blow count; the test details
are given in Sec. 3-7.
These jar samples are usually large enough to provide sufficient material for the Atterberg
limits and natural water content. In routine work these index properties, used with correla-
tion tables and charts and with qu, are sufficient to select the foundation type, estimate the
allowable bearing capacity, and make some kind of estimates of probable settlement.
This is particularly true if the soil is stiff, is above the water table, or is overconsolidated
and fissured where it is difficult to push a thin-walled sample tube and/or obtain an intact
sample for a compression test. The penetration number N (a measure of resistance) is usually
sufficient for making estimates of both strength and settlement in cohesionless soils. Where
the geotechnical consultant has obtained sufficient experience to build a reasonable database,
strength/settlement predictions made in this manner are quite adequate for about 85 to 90
percent of foundation work.
It is the other 10 to 15 percent of the work that taxes the ingenuity of the geotechnical
engineer. In recognizing the difficulty both of obtaining a quality sample and of trying to
return it to the K0 condition for a laboratory test, in situ tests described in later sections may
be used. This is particularly true for important structures founded on fine to medium sands
and where strata of very soft cohesive and/or organic soils are present. Even thin seams (or
layers) of these latter soils may be sufficient to cause great problems, even where the primary
deposit is sand or other better-quality material. In any case, unless competent lower strata are
close enough to decide a viable foundation alternative immediately, some testing of (or in)
these poor soils will be required.

Undisturbed Sampling in Cohesive Soils
As the field boring progresses and soft layers are encountered that may influence the founda-
tion selection/design, undisturbed samples are usually taken so that consolidation and more
refined laboratory strength tests can be made.
Recovery of "undisturbed" samples in cohesive soils is accomplished by replacing the
split spoon on the drill rod with specially constructed thin-walled (1.63 to 3.25 mm) seamless
steel tubing (610 mm in length X 51 to 89 mm in diameter), which should be pushed, but is
sometimes driven, the tube length into the soil. The tube is slightly rotated (or a previously
attached special cutting device is used) to cut the sample off. Friction holds the sample in the
tube as the sample is withdrawn; however, there are also special valve or piston (Fig. 3-6)
arrangements that use a pressure differential (suction) to retain the sample in the tube.
A special sampler termed a foil sampler (Fig. 3-6b) was developed in Sweden [see
Hvorslev (1949, p. 269), Kjellman (1948)] to overcome two principal deficiencies of the
usual sampling tubes and piston samplers. These deficiencies are short sample length and
side friction between the inside tube wall and soil as soil is forced into the sampler. Re-
ducing side friction requires using short sample tubes. If one is in a soil suspected of being
particularly troublesome, it may be necessary to take continuous samples. These are not
practical with samplers of, say, 1 m maximum length because of continually having to pull
the drill rods to attach a new tube. The foil sampler is a means of recovering samples 10 to
20 m in length with a minimal friction effect. The interested reader should consult the cited
references for exact details, but essentially the sampler operates by first being placed on the
bottom of the borehole. Next it is pushed into the soil; as the sample enters the tube, it is
surrounded by 16 foil strips (thin metal strips about 13-mm wide by 0.5- to 1.0-mm thick),
which carry it up the tube. Friction between soil and foils results in reducing the compressive
stress in the sample as the length of recovered sample increases in the tube.
If the soil is extremely soft, or experience indicates that in situ tests should be made (and
the necessary equipment is available), only a few "undisturbed" tube samples for consolida-
tion tests should be taken. As a general rule, tube samples for consolidation tests should be at
least 12 mm larger than the consolidation ring (to allow trimming the disturbed perimeter); in
practice, a 76-mm tube sample is often collected for use in the 64-mm diameter consolidome-
ter. Sometimes a 51-mm tube sample is used with a 48-mm diameter consolidometer, but this
size test diameter is so small that it is not recommended. Tube samples larger than 76 mm
can be obtained, but if they are much larger than 100 mm a premium may be charged for
the extra drilling effort and tube cost—particularly if stainless steel tubes are used for rust
control.3
Although sample disturbance depends on factors such as rate of penetration, whether the
cutting force is obtained by pushing or driving, and presence of gravel, it also depends on the
ratio of the volume of soil displaced to the volume of collected sample, expressed as an area
ratio A/.

3 Ordinary steel tubes rust rapidly, with resulting great difficulty in sample extrusion. ASTM D 1587 requires an
inside protective coating if a sample is to be contained in the tube more than 72 hr.

Well-designed sample tubes should have an area ratio of less than about 10 percent. The
widely used 51-mm thin walled tube has an Ar of about 13 percent as computed in Example
3-1.
Another term used in estimating the degree of disturbance of a cohesive or rock core sam-
ple is the recovery ratio Lr:
_ Actual length of recovered sample
r Theoretical length of recovered sample
A recovery ratio of 1 (recovered length of the sample = the length sampler was forced into
the stratum) indicates that, theoretically, the sample did not become compressed from friction
on the tube. A recovery ratio greater than 1.0 would indicate a loosening of the sample from
rearrangement of stones, roots, removal of preload, or other factors.
In the final analysis, however, engineering judgment must be relied upon to extrapolate
the results of tests on "undisturbed" samples to the prediction of field behavior.

Example 3-1. What is the area ratio of the 51-mm diam. thin walled sample tube?

Solution. Using dimensions from a supplier's catalog, obtain OD = 50.8 mm and ID = 47.7 mm.
(The actual ID of the tube is slightly larger than the ID of the cutting edge to reduce side friction on
the sample as the tube is pushed into the soil.) Direct substitution into Eq. (3-1) gives

3-6 UNDERWATER SAMPLING
Common constructions that require some kind of underwater exploration program include
bridge piers, port structures, pipelines, oil well platforms, land recovery (fills to extend the
shore line or for an island), and the like.
It is usually necessary to collect enough data to make a strength estimate. Soil shear
strength determines how much pile embedment is required or whether a fill will require spe-
cial construction procedures. Estimates of settlement are also often required—both how much
and how long it will take. This is very critical for land recovery operations, since the client
will want to know when enough settlement has occurred so that construction of surface facil-
ities can begin.
The in situ testing and recovery procedures for underwater samples, either in a freshwater
or a saltwater environment, are not much different from those for dry land for water depths up
to about 45 m. The principal differences are that the testing or drilling equipment is mounted
on a barge that is towed to the test location and securely anchored and that casing is used,
at least to the water bed and possibly 1 or 2 meters into the bed. The casing strength is the
principal cause for limiting the depth to about 45 m. For this situation the barge is securely
anchored using four to six anchors so it does not shift or twist. Sometimes divers are used to
observe visually if any construction difficulty will be encountered or if there are any existing
underwater obstructions.


A barge-mounted drilling rig (drilling over the side) is a common method for drilling
in rivers, in lake beds, and in the shallower water along the continental shelf for bridges,
port structures, or land recovery. Penetration, vane, and pressuremeter tests described in the
following sections can be made in the borings.
In deeper water (up to 1,000+ m) wave action requires alternative exploration equipment,
such as a small ship converted to a drilling platform by installing a center well of 460 to
610 mm diameter from the deck through the hull and adding a drill rig. This configuration
is sometimes called a drill ship. Submarine-type vessels (sometimes called submersibles)
are also used. In very deep water a platform might be constructed, off of which the explo-
ration crew might work. Any of these equipment options will allow recovery of samples of
reasonable quality.
Where wave action occurs, it is necessary to use casing with flexible joints, and a casing
diameter large enough to allow passage of the sampling (or test device) tube. In deeper water
the drill pipe may act as the casing (again using flexible joints). In this case the lower end of
the pipe holds the auger bit, which produces an over-sized hole. At the desired level a sampler
is lowered through the drill pipe to the base of the hole and either driven or pushed into the
soil below the bit.
There are also projectile-type devices that are lowered to the ocean floor from the drill
ship to recover soil samples. Servomechanisms commanded from the surface may be used to
force a sample tube into the soil using the weight of either the surface vessel or some kind
of reaction device placed on the seafloor. A projectile device may contain a gas or explosive
charge to propel a sample tube into the soil, again using the weight of the total device as a
reaction. Most of these types of devices are patented and/or proprietary. Deepwater divers
are sometimes used to recover samples or to inspect the reaction device.
In situ tests are currently considered preferable to sample recovery, particularly for
strength testing. It is difficult to recover good-quality samples from underwater because
of the change in pore pressure when the sample is brought above water. As a minimum, air
bubbles tend to come out of the pore water and occupy a greater volume, causing the sample
to expand or even explode. If the sample is still in the sample tube, the expansion may cause
the sample to extend out of the tube end(s).
Depending on the equipment, the sample recovery tube (about 50- to 75-mm ID and 610
to 100O+ mm in length) may be pushed or driven. A pushed sample is generally of better
quality than one obtained by driving the tube into the soil. Shorter tube lengths generally
produce better-quality samples, since side friction is significant with all tube samples; if the
sample is too long, it may become compressed from side friction between the sample and the
inside walls of the sampler.
At a given site a few samples should be recovered for visual inspection and possibly some
index tests (w#, W>L, Ip).
A driven-tube recovered sample will often have excessive disturbance for strength testing,
but the blow count to drive the tube gives some indication of soil strength, somewhat like the
SPT test described in the next section.
A number of underwater exploration methods are described in ASTM (1971) and appear
among the references cited by Focht and Kraft (1977), which the interested reader may wish
to consult. Using the in situ vane test (of Sec. 3-12) for underwater exploration is described
in ASTM (1988). Olsen et al. (1986) described an elaborate marine sampling and testing
program undertaken in 1979-1980.


3-7 THE STANDARD PENETRATION TEST (SPT)
The standard penetration test, developed around 1927, is currently the most popular and eco-
nomical means to obtain subsurface information (both on land and offshore). It is estimated
that 85 to 90 percent of conventional foundation design in North and South America is made
using the SPT. This test is also widely used in other geographic regions. The method has been
standardized as ASTM D 1586 since 1958 with periodic revisions to date. The test consists
of the following:

1. Driving the standard split-barrel sampler of dimensions shown in Fig. 3-5a a distance of
460 mm into the soil at the bottom of the boring.
2. Counting the number of blows to drive the sampler the last two 150 mm distances (total
= 300 mm) to obtain the N number.4
3. Using a 63.5-kg driving mass (or hammer) falling "free" from a height of 760 mm. Several
hammer configurations are shown in Fig. 3-7.

The exposed drill rod is referenced with three chalk marks 150 mm apart, and the guide
rod (see Fig. 3-7) is marked at 760 mm (for manual hammers). The assemblage is then seated
on the soil in the borehole (after cleaning it of loose cuttings). Next the sampler is driven a
distance of 150 mm to seat it on undisturbed soil, with this blow count being recorded (unless
the system mass sinks the sampler so no Af can be counted). The sum of the blow counts for
the next two 150-mm increments is used as the penetration count Af unless the last increment
cannot be completed. In this case the sum of the first two 150-mm penetrations is recorded
as N.
The boring log shows refusal and the test is halted if

1. 50 blows are required for any 150-mm increment.
2. 100 blows are obtained (to drive the required 300 mm).
3. 10 successive blows produce no advance.

When the full test depth cannot be obtained, the boring log will show a ratio as
70/100 or 50/100
indicating that 70 (or 50) blows resulted in a penetration of 100 mm. Excessive equipment
wear, as well as greatly reduced daily drilling meterage, results when blow counts are high.
Standardization of refusal at 100 blows allows all drilling organizations to standardize costs
so that higher blow counts result in a negotiation for a higher cost/length of boring or a
requirement for some type of coring operation.
SPT testing prior to about 1967 (according to ASTM) only required the sampler to be
seated and then driven 300 mm. This stipulation could reduce the N count nearly 50 percent

4Strictly, the driving distance should be 305 mm since the original test was based on a driving distance of 12 inches.
Owing to the approximate nature of the test it will be adequate to use a distance of 300 mm and divide it into two
150-mm increments. The rationale is that the driving depth is never exact, since one cannot drive using a fractional
hammer drop. If the last hammer drop produces more than 300 mm of penetration, it is still considered 300 mm.


Figure 3-7 Schematic diagrams of the three commonly used hammers. Hammer (b) is used about 60 percent;
(a) and (c) about 20 percent each in the United States. Hammer (c) is commonly used outside the United States.
Note that the user must be careful with (b) and (c) not to contact the limiter and "pull" the sampler out of the soil.
Guide rod X is marked with paint or chalk for visible height control when the hammer is lifted by rope off the
cathead (power takeoff).

since the first 150 mm of required seating produces substantial friction resistance on the
sampler for the next 300 mm. It is unfortunate that many current SPT correlations are based
on N values from this earlier procedure.
Both before and after ASTM standardization it was regularly observed that Af values from
adjacent boreholes or from using different equipment in adjacent holes were not reproducible.
Because of wide SPT use, this problem received much attention—first by Gibbs and Holtz
(1957), who considered that overburden pressure and length of drill rod were the principal
causes of nonreproducibility. Beyond this, not much was done until de Mello (1971) presented
a comprehensive literature survey that started a focus on the driving energy [Schmertmann
(1975)].
Discrepancies can arise from factors such as using a warped or worn driving shoe, pushing
a rock (usually detected by an experienced driller), and allowing a quick condition in the hole
bottom resulting from too rapid withdrawal of auger or bit plug or from a differential in water

level between GWT and in hole (or stem of hollow auger). A quick condition is avoided by
attention to the ASTM 1586 standard. The status of the drive shoe can be ensured by regular
inspection, especially after hard driving.
Proper attention to these causes of discrepancies leaves the input driving energy and its
dissipation around the sampler into the surrounding soil as the principal factors for the wide
range in Af values. It should be evident that the blow count would be directly related to the
driving energy, which is theoretically computed as follows:
Em = ^rnv2 = -—v2 (a)
v = (2gh)l/2 (b)
and substituting Eq. (b) into Eq. (a), we obtain
1 W
Ein = ^-(2gh) = Wh (c)
where W = weight or mass of hammer and h = height of fall. This gives, for the standard
63.5 kg hammer and h = 762 mm (30 in.), the theoretical input driving energy of
Em = 63.5 X 9.807 X 0.762 - 474.5 (say, 475 J)
Kovacs and Salomone (1982) found that the actual input driving energy Ea to the sampler
to produce penetration ranged from about 30 to 80 percent; Riggs et al. (1983) obtained energy
inputs ranging from about 70 to 100 percent. These discrepancies appear to arise from factors
such as the following:

1. Equipment from different manufacturers. A large variety of drilling rigs are in current
use; however, the rotary auger of Fig. 3-3a with the safety hammer of Fig. 3-lb is the
most common in North American practice.
2. Drive hammer configurations of Fig. 3-7. The anvil also seems to have some influence on
the amount of energy input to the sampler.
3. Whether
a. the hammer uses an automatic trip with the drop height h controlled to within ±25 mm,
or
b. the system used is a rope-cathead (low-speed power takeoff pulley) (see Fig. 3-8) with
Ea dependent on
(/) diameter and condition of rope
(U) diameter and condition of cathead (rusty, clean, etc., and whether using 125- or
200-mm diameter—200-mm is common in North America)
(///) number of turns of rope around cathead, as 1 \, 2, 3, etc. It appears that a nominal
2 turns is optimum and in wide use. There may be some influence on whether the
rope is pulled from the top (1 \ turns) or from the bottom (2^ turns) of the cathead.
(iv) the actual drop height at which the operator releases the rope to allow the hammer
to "free" fall. Riggs (1986) suggests the operator commonly overlifts an average
of 50 mm (actual drop height = 810 mm). This results from the operator pulling
the rope into the spinning cathead (Fig. 3-8), visually observing the lift to a mark

ing off the bottom of cathead and operator is observing for height mark on hammer guide rod. Helper in foreground
is taking count and observing penetration.

(see Fig. 3-7) on the guide rod, and then releasing the rope back toward the cathead
so it loosens and allows the hammer to fall. Reaction time and mark visibility result
in this overlift. The operator commonly obtains 40 to 50 blows/minute.
4. Whether a liner is used inside the split barrel sampler. Side friction increases the driving
resistance (and AO and is less without the liner (shown in Fig. 3-5a). It is common practice
not to use a liner. Also it would appear that N values should be larger for soils with OCR
> 1 (and larger relative density Dr) than for normally consolidated soils.
5. Overburden pressure. Soils of the same density will give smaller TV values if p'o is smaller
(as near the ground surface). Oversize boreholes on the order of 150 to 200 mm will also
reduce N unless a rotary hollow-stem auger is used with the auger left in close contact
with the soil in the hole bottom. Degree of cementation may also be significant in giving
higher N counts in cemented zones that may have little overburden pressure.
6. Length of drill rod. Above about 10 m the rod length does not seem critical; however,
for shorter lengths and Af < 30 it is. This effect was first examined by Gibbs and Holtz


(1957) and later by McLean et al. (1975) and others [see Sehmertmann (1979)], who used
a computer model to analyze the influence of rod length as well as other factors such as
sampler resistance.

From the several recent studies cited (and their reference lists) it has been suggested that
the SPT be standardized to some energy ratio Er which should be computed as
_ Actual hammer energy to sampler, Ea Ky _ _
t,r = x iuu (a)
Input energy, Em
There are proposals to compute E1n based on the measured hammer velocity at impact with
the anvil or as the measured energy in the drill rod just below the anvil. It would appear,
however, that using the theoretical value given by Eq. (c) for Em would be preferable as it is
not equipment-dependent.
Since there is a wide scatter in Er and the resulting blow count Af when it is reasonable to
expect there should be a unique N for the soil at some depth, it is suggested the drill system-
dependent Er of Eq. (d) be referenced to a standard energy ratio value E^. In this way a drill
rig with, say, Er = 45 would, on adjustment to the standard Er\,, compute approximately the
same N count as from a drill rig with Er = 70. There are several current suggestions for the
value of the standard energy ratio Erb as follows:

Erb Reference

50 to 55 (use 55) Sehmertmann [in Robertson et al. (1983)]
60 Seed et al. (1985); Skempton (1986)
70 to 80 (use 70) Riggs (1986)

The author will use 70 since the more recent data using current drilling equipment with a
safety or an automatic hammer and with driller attention to ASTM D 1586 details indicate
this is close to the actual energy ratio Er obtained in North American practice. If a different
standard energy ratio Erb is specified, however, it is a trivial exercise to convert to the different
base, as will be shown next.
The standard blow count Nj0 can be computed from the measured Af as follows:
ATy0 = CN X N X Tji x T]2 X 773 X 174 (3-3)
where 77/ = adjustment factors from (and computed as shown) Table 3-3
Nj0 = adjusted Af using the subscript for the Ert, and the ' to indicate it has been

nearly the average of all those proposed and is the simplest to use.

Note that larger values of Er decrease the blow count N nearly linearly, that is, Er^ gives
N = 20 and Er9o gives N = 10; however, using the "standard" value of Erjo gives an N
value for use in Eq. (3-3) of N = 13 for either drilling rig. We obtain this by noting that the
energy ratio X blow count should be a constant for any soil, so
En XN1 = Er2 X Af2 (e)
or
N2 = ^ 1 X N1 (3-4)
ErI
For the arbitrarily chosen Er\ = 70, this gives, in general,
Nl = 1IxN1
ErI
For the previous example of N2 for E^ = 20 = Er2 we obtain

giving (use integers)


If we convert NJO to Af60 we have

Af2 = N^o = —-(13) = 15 [which is larger as predicted by Eq. (e)]
60
Using the relationship given by Eq. (e) we can readily convert any energy ratio to any other
base, but we do have to know the energy ratio at which the blow count was initially obtained.
It is evident from Table 3-3 that all r// = 1 in Eq. (3-3) for the case of a small bore hole,
no sampler liner, length of drill rod over 10 m (30 ft) and the given drill rig has Er = 70. In
this case the only adjustment A^0 is for overburden pressure using CN. This observation is
made since there are several opinions on N corrections:

1. Do nothing, which, with current equipment and conditions, may be nearly correct. This
may have an advantage of detecting increases of soil stiffness (Es) with depth, and upper
variations may indicate cementation or OCR > 1.
2. Adjust only for overburden pressure (all 17; = 1 and CN = some value).
3. Use Eq. (3-3). This is probably the best method but requires equipment calibration for
Er—both equipment and operator. It will also require regular recalibration of the individ-
ual drilling rigs to account for wear and general equipment changes with use. This pro-
cedure will probably become mandatory to extrapolate N data across geographic regions
where different equipment (and Er) is used.
Conventional practice is to do an SPT every 1 or 2 m after penetrating the topsoil or starting
the first test at about 1- to 1 ^-m depth. For each test there is a sample recovery of about 460
mm including the seating depth to provide a visual profile of around 50 percent of the boring
depth.
Cohesionless samples are visually inspected and a portion is saved in a glass jar on which is
marked job, boring number, depth, and field N. Cohesive samples are treated similarly, except
qu tests are routinely made—most often taking several values using a pocket penetrometer
(see Fig. 3-9) with the average recorded. A small compression machine can be taken to the
field for qu tests; however, because of the area adjustment for strain (shown on Fig. 2-29) this
is not commonly done. As a supplement in cohesive soils it is usual practice to take several
thin-walled tube samples for laboratory testing as necessary (and to verify the field qu).
The original SPT was developed for sand; however, at present it is commonly done at the
given depth for all soils.
Several examples will illustrate the use of Eq. (3-3).

3-8 SPTCORRELATIONS
The SPT has been used in correlations for unit weight 7, relative density Dr, angle of inter-
nal friction (/>, and undrained compressive strength qu. It has also been used to estimate the
bearing capacity of foundations (see Chap. 4, Sec. 4-10) and for estimating the stress-strain
modulus Es (see Chap. 5, Table 5-6).
For reasons given in the preceding sections many of these correlations are questionable.
Some are based on a small database or on specific soils. Where a large database was used,
there is the question of what Er was used, this being very critical since many databases were
obtained from published literature that might range from the early 1940s to the present for a
corresponding range of Er on the order of 35 to 80 percent.

* Excavated soil or material dumped from a truck has a unit weight of 11 to 14 kN/m3 and must be quite dense
to weigh much over 21 kN/m3. No existing soil has a Dr = 0.00 nor a value of 1.00. Common ranges are from
0.3 to 0.7.

The following are several SPT Af-value correlations for angle of friction c/>. The top two of
Eq. (3-5) are from Shioi and Fukui (1982), who obtained them from the Japanese Railway
Standards:
<!> = Ju^o + 15
cf> = 036N10 + 27 ( 3 " 5 )
cf) = 4.5N1O + 20 (in general)
The top equation of this set is for roads and bridges, and the second is for buildings (refer
also to Table 3-4).
A relationship for N and Dr was proposed indirectly by Meyerhof (1957) as
^ = A +Bp0 (3-5fl)

For this equation Skempton (1986), using a database of five different soils, found that A and
B are site-dependent with a range in A of 15 to about 54 and in B from 0.306 to 0.204 (using
the Nt]0 base). This spread is such that using average values for A and B is somewhat risky;
however, using averages we obtain

^ P = 32 + 0.288^; (3-56)
with p'o in kPa. For an average unit weight y of 16 to 17 kN/m3 and a depth of about 6 m
one obtains NjO/D^ ~ 60, which was also used as a guide in designating the TV values for
normally consolidated sands of Table 3-4. For overconsolidated sands (OCR > 1), Skempton
(1986) suggested the following adjustment:

(3-5c)


In this equation we define the new symbol COCR as follows:

1. Let the mean effective normal stress (as used in Sec. 2-11.2) be defined as
_ (Tx + CTy H- (T z
az = (Jx = (Jy = K0(T1
2. Now on substitution into the above and using p'o for az obtain the mean effective normal
stress in situ (for a normally consolidated soil) as
^ i —i 1 + 2A.a n c ,
^OCRPO = Po,nc = 3 Po

3. By usage definition the factor

^ _ Po,nc
(-OCR - —,
Po.OCR
and we can, by using the appropriately subscripted K0j and canceling p'o from both the
numerator and denominator because this is the existing effective overburden pressure,
obtain
1 + 2KOt11c (~ ^
^OCR = 1 , ~ v (3-0)

This value of COCR is used in Eq. (3-5c). Note that this equation gives COCR = 1 for a nor-
mally consolidated sand. Use any of Eqs. (2-18) through (2-25) to obtain the lateral pressure
coefficient^/.
By using Dr from Eq. (3-5c) we can estimate (f> (Meyerhof, 1959) as
$ = 28 + 0.15Dr (D r = %) (3-7)
or use the following equation, suggested by Yoshida et al. (1988), to compute Dr and then
back-compute (f>\
Dr = C0' p ' o ~C l • A^0 2 (3-8)
In this equation Dr is in percent, and effective overburden pressure p0 is in kPa. The SPT
A^6o value is suggested by the author because little guidance is given in the cited reference.
Yoshida et al. (1988) give a range of Co of 18 to 25 for soils with a best fit for all the soils of
25; a range for exponent C2 from 0.44 to 0.57 with a best fit of 0.46; and a range for C\ from
0.12 to 0.14 with a best fit of 0.12. These give
Dr = 25 .p'o -°l2'№6046 (3-8a)
and for a soil of y = 20 kN/m3 at a depth of 5 m with A^o = 16, obtain p'o = yz = 20
kN/m3 X 5 m = 100 kPa and compute Dr = 51.5 —»52 percent, and using Eq. (3-7), obtain
4> - 36°.
The data shown in Table 3-4 for Dr and <p relate approximately to N^0 for borehole depths
on the order of 4 to 6 m, as these might be the depth zone for spread footings. Additionally,
one can use the preceding equations for guidance.

* Blow counts and OCR division are for a guide—in clay "exceptions to the rule" are very common.

Before using this table for design you should see a sample of the soil and have determined
an average blow count N1-. With these data, use values from the table cautiously, because of
the variables such as aging, natural cementation, water table location, and angularity of the
soil grains. Additionally, terms such as fine, medium, and coarse are somewhat subjective,
so any table value will be difficult to defend. With this precautionary note, we use the table
but include any additional site information that is available.
A correlation for N versus qu is in the general form of
qu = kN (3-9)
where the value of k tends to be site-dependent; however, a value of k = 12 has been used
(i.e., for Nj0 = 10, qu = 120 kPa). Correlations for Nj0 and consistency of cohesive soil
deposits (soft, stiff, hard, etc.) are given in Table 3-5.
With the current practice of recovering samples and routinely inspecting them, performing
on-site qu tests with a pocket penetrometer, or using an unconfined compression test device,
it is not necessary to use strength or consistency correlations. This is particularly true because
of variations in OCR, aging, sample water content (or GWT location), presence or absence of
drilling fluid, and site variations in terms of history, method of deposit formation and presence
of gravel, and so on.
Most SPT correlations are based on modifying the coefficients of Eq. (3-5a) or using a
different k in Eq. (3-9).

3-9 DESIGN W VALUES
Early recommendations were to use the smallest N value in the boring or an average of all of
the values for the particular stratum. Current practice is to use an average N but in the zone of
major stressing. For example, for a spread footing the zone of interest is from about one-half
the footing width B above the estimated base location to a depth of about IB below. Weighted
averaging using depth increment X N may be preferable to an ordinary arithmetic average;
that is, Nav = Z N • Zi/ Z Zi and not X N1Ji.
For pile foundations there may be merit in the simple averaging of blow count N for any
stratum unless it is very thick—thick being a relative term. Here it may be better to subdivide
the thick stratum into several "strata" and average the N count for each subdivision.
The average corrected Nj0 (or other base value) can then be computed from the average
field-measured Af and stratum data, or individual corrected Nj0 values can be computed and
then averaged.


Before the mid-1960s N values were adjusted6 when they were taken from below the
GWT. Current practice is not to adjust N values, because they are already reduced from
being taken below the GWT (i.e., the blow count N is reduced from excess pore pressure
as the sampler is driven). Work by Drozd (1974) indicates a reduced blow count is possible
below the GWT but depends on the relative density. For example, reading approximately
from one of his graphs (note: one cannot use a fraction of a blow), the following values were
obtained:

Dr,% Ndry iVsat
40 4 1
50 5 2
60 8 4
70 9 6
8O+ Same values for either soil state

For a sand state intermediate between "dry" and "saturated," the blow counts were sometimes
larger than "dry" values of N. Although Drozd used a model split spoon (one-third the size of
standard), he used seven different sands. The particle sizes ranged from 0.05 to 5 mm. The trend
is evident that wet and saturated sands do not give values that are obtainable in "dry" sands.
If one is to use Af values to obtain the stress-strain modulus Es, which generally increases
with depth (at least in any individual stratum), great care is required in how one adjusts N.
Using the factor CM in Eq. (3-3) would modify any N to a value corresponding to a depth
producing crv = 95.76 kPA and eliminate much of the depth effect. On the other hand, if we
want a value of N for a zone of, say, 2B beneath a spread footing, we should use CM after the
averaged N^ is computed.

3-10 OTHER PENETRATION TEST METHODS
A number of other penetration methods are in use. The cone penetration test (CPT) of the
next section appears to be one of the most popular. In a particular locale, though, one of the
other tests may be preferable.
Figure 3-10 represents a Swedish weight sounding method used in most of Scandinavia,
some countries in eastern Europe, and Japan and China. The test seems suited only for very
soft silt or soft clay deposits. Basically, the test consists in pushing the device to some depth
and then adding sufficient mass until the screw tip begins to self-turn and move downward.
The mass and number of half-turns to advance some specified distance (usually 1 m or the tip
length) are recorded. If the maximum mass of 100 kg does not start the penetrometer turning,
it is turned by hand (or a driving motor), and the number of half-turns to advance the specified
distance is recorded. The soil type is related to the plot of weight versus turn number as for
example, a soft, medium, or stiff clay, or other. Usually the test is supplemented by some
method that allows sample recovery for a visual comparison of the sounding test data to the
soil type. This test is not standardized, so correlations would only apply to the area—and for
that tip configuration.

6Usually as N' = N + ±(N - 15) for N > 15; N' = N for N < 15.

Figures 3-11 and 3-12 are dynamic cone penetrometers that are used for dynamic pene-
tration testing. This type test has some use in Europe and Asia but not much in North and
South America. This test consists in driving the tip to some depth and recording the num-
ber of blows (somewhat similar to the SPT). Correlations exist but are usually specific to a
locale because neither the conical-shaped tip nor the driving mass is standardized. Dynamic
penetration testing is most suited to gravelly soil deposits.
Figure 3-13 is an illustration of a hand-held penetrometer developed by the U.S. Water-
ways Experiment Station (it can be purchased from most soil laboratory equipment suppliers).
The device has most application at shallow depths where the user can push the cone tip into
the ground and simultaneously read the resistance from deformation of the load ring. Typical
applications include soil where a spread footing is to be placed and soil being monitored for
quality control of compacted fills.

3-11 CONE PENETRATION TEST7 (CPT)
The CPT is a simple test that is now widely used in lieu of the SPT—particularly for soft
clays, soft silts, and in fine to medium sand deposits. The test is not well adapted to gravel
deposits or to stiff/hard cohesive deposits. This test has been standardized by ASTM as D
3441. In outline, the test consists in pushing the standard cone (see Figs. 3-14 and 3-15) into

the ground at a rate of 10 to 20 mm/s and recording the resistance. The total cone resistance is
made up of side friction on the cone shaft perimeter and tip pressure. Data usually recorded are
the cone side resistance qs, point resistance qc, and depth. Pore pressures, vertical alignment,
and temperature may also be taken if allowed by the equipment configuration (see Fig. 3-15).
The tip (or cone) usually has a projected cross-sectional area of 10 cm2, but larger tips are
also used and may provide more reliable pore pressure readings. The cone diameter does not
seem to be a significant factor for tip areas between 5 and 15 cm2.
A CPT allows nearly continuous testing at many sites, which is often valuable. If the soil is
stratified, the test may be performed in parallel with a drilling machine. In this case the hole
is drilled to soft material, a CPT is done, boring recommences, and so on. This test is rather
popular for sites where there are deep deposits of transported soil such as in flood plains, river
deltas, and along coastlines.
There are at least five cone types in use, although the ASTM D 3441 standard lists only
three.

1. Mechanical—the earliest type, often called the Dutch cone since it was first developed
and used in The Netherlands. A typical later configuration with a friction sleeve is shown
in Fig. 3-14.
2. Electric friction—first modification using strain gauges to measure qc (point resistance)
and qs (side friction) (see Fig. 3-15«).
3. Electric piezo—a modification of the electric friction cone to allow measuring the pore
water pressure during the test at the cone tip (see Fig. 3-15&).
4. Electric piezo/friction—a further modification to measure point resistance, sleeve friction,
and pore pressure.

5. Seismic cone—a further modification to include a vibration sensor to obtain data to com-
pute the shear wave velocity from a surface hammer impact so that the dynamic shear
modulus can be computed [Campanella et al. (1986)].

There are several configurations of the piezocone of Fig. 3-15a, and it is critical that the
friction sleeve diameter tolerance be 0 to not more than 0.25 mm larger than the cone tip
diameter—if smaller, the side friction is too low. The piezometer (pore pressure sensor) el-
ement may be made from sintered metal, ceramics, or stone. It may be located at the "tip,"
somewhere along the cone face, or at the cone base—and sometimes both in the tip and at the
cone base. Both the location of the tip and the type of material to be used in it are important,
as any roughness will reflect into the tip resistance. Cone usage in sandy materials quickly
roughens the tip. A serious concern using pore pressure sensors is that they be kept saturated,
for any air that is present will substantially reduce the pressure that is recorded. The base
location generally produces a lower measured pore pressure than for the tip (or cone face)
location.
Some of the electrical cones may also be provided with inclinometer electronics to measure
deviation from the vertical alignment, usually caused from encountering a hard stratum or
large stones. Data deteriorate as the cone slope increases from the vertical. When this occurs,
the test is usually halted, the equipment moved a few meters away, and a new test begun.

A temperature sensor may be located near the tip so that a calibration based on the in situ
(usually cooler than laboratory) value can be made. If the cone electronics are calibrated in
the laboratory at a temperature different from the soil, the output will be in error some amount.
The original mechanical cone test is illustrated in Fig. 3-14Z? with the step sequence as
follows:

1. The cone system is stationary at position 1.
2. The cone is advanced by pushing an inner rod to extrude the cone tip and a short length
of cone shaft. This action measures the tip resistance qc.
3. The outer shaft is now advanced to the cone base, and skin resistance is measured as the
force necessary to advance the shaft qs.
4. Now the cone and sleeve are advanced in combination to obtain position 4 and to obtain
a <?totah which should be approximately the sum of the qc + qs just measured. The cone is
now positioned for a new position 1.

By using an electrical cone configuration, a start-stop operation of the mechanical cone is
not required (except to add push rod extensions). The test consists in making a continuous
push with the output recorded electronically.
The test (on land) is usually done from a truck-mounted cone with an opening in the truck
bed (or from the end gate) and the pushing equipment located so that the cone with suitable
drill rods attached can be pushed into the soil. The system may also be mounted on all-terrain
vehicles so that remote areas can be accessed. The mass of the vehicle and pushing equipment
provides the reaction, but this mass may on occasion require additional anchorage—usually
soil screw anchors.
When the pushing is continuous, it is advantageous to connect the cone output directly to
a dedicated computer. Doing so makes it much easier both to compute necessary output and
to plot results.
A test over water is similar to a land test. The vehicle or equipment is placed on a barge
(or drill ship) that is moved to the site and securely anchored, both to resist wave action and
to allow for any additional reaction.
Piezocone output is generalized in Fig. 3-16, where pore pressure is measured along with
cone pressure qc. Figure 3-17 illustrates two cone test records in soil as indicated.
The CPT test data are used to classify a soil, to establish the allowable bearing capac-
ity of shallow foundation elements, or to design piles. They have been extensively used in
the design of piles for offshore oil-drilling platforms. The data generally require some sup-
plemental information derived from other exploration methods (i.e., SPT usually) unless the
geotechnical consultant has done previous work in nearby areas. The supplemental data are
required because CPT data can be quite erratic. Inspection of Fig. 3-17 reveals a number of
"peaks," so that for the data to be useful some kind of resistance averaging must be done.
The averaging is usually based on the user's judgement and inspection of the several plots.
If the data are stored in a computer, an installed program might be used to obtain averages in
the several strata.
The measured point resistance qc and sleeve friction (or side friction) are used to compute
the friction ratio fr as

The friction ratio is primarily used for soil classification, as illustrated in Figs. 3- 18a and b.
It may also be used to give an estimate of the soil sensitivity, St [see Eq. (2-63)] with the
correlation being approximately [see Robertson and Campanella (1983a)]
c 1 0

In this equation use fr in percent. The constant 10 (a value of 15 was formerly used) is an
approximation that may be improved with data from specific areas.

3-11.1 CPT Correlations for Cohesive Soil
Cone resistance may be directly used in design, but usually it is incorporated as some mul-
tiple of qc. Instead of directly using qc, one may obtain the required design parameter from
one of the many correlations that use a relationship between qc and the quantity of interest.
Those correlations that seem to have most acceptance are given here; however, since they are
generalized, a user should use them cautiously, because they may not be applicable locally.
What a practitioner should do is plot local correlations onto these charts as practical, and as
a trend develops, revise the equations.
One correlation between the cone bearing resistance qc and undrained shear strength su is
based on the bearing capacity equation (of Chap. 4) and is as follows:
qc = Nksu + Po
Solving for the undrained shear strength su, one obtains
Qc ~ Po n i n
SU = -Tj (3-H)

where po = yz — overburden pressure point where qc is measured as previously defined
and used. This parameter is in the units of qc and same type of pressure (i.e.,
if qc is an effective pressure, use p'o).

Nk = cone factor (a constant for that soil). Nk has been found to range from 5 to 75;
however, most values are in the 10 to 30 range and, further, most values are in
the 15 to 20 range. Figure 3-19 is a correlation based on the plasticity index
Ip which might be used.

Because of the wide scatter in Nk, a number of persons have suggested correcting the
piezocone resistance qc with the measured pore pressure uc to reduce the scatter [see Aas et al.
(1986), but it was suggested earlier by Robertson and Campanella (1983a)]. The adjustment
of qc to a corrected total tip resistance qj is
qr = qc + uc(l-a) (3-12)

where a = an area ratio that depends on the cone type. It can be computed (see Fig. 3-l5b
or inset of Fig. 3-18Z?) as
TTD1IA - kirdi/A _ kd\
~T~T~WA ' W -*
If calibration is not used, it is common to assume k = 1 above, giving a =
(d\/D)2\ from calibration, a has been found to range from about 0.4 to 0.9, but
for the "standard cone," with a 10 cm2 area, the range is from about 0.6 to 0.9.
A given cone can be calibrated8 by inserting the system in a container of water

Figure 3-19 Cone factor Nk versus
IP plotted for several soils with range in
sensitivity noted. [After Lunne and Eide
(1976).]

The NkT value is introduced here to identify that the adjusted cone bearing pressure qj is
being used. This seems to reduce the scatter to a range of about 10 to 20, which is a narrow
enough range that the following equation (author's interpretation) can be used:

NkT = 13 + J^IP (±2) (3-14)

Thus, for clay with a plasticity index//> = 20, we compute NkT = 15.2 ±2, or NkT is between
13.2 and 17.2.
It is also possible to estimate the soil type as clay or cohesionless by inspection of the ratio
of pore-pressure change Aw (see Fig. 3-16) and the measured cone resistance as
ku/qc
Very small values of this ratio represent cohesionless materials, for which the coefficient
of permeability will be large enough that the excess pressure Aw generated by the probe
displacement quickly dissipates. In cohesive deposits pore pressure does not dissipate very
rapidly so the Aw/#c ratio is usually larger. The Aw/#c ratio is generally lower for overcon-
solidated cohesive soils (OCR > 1) than for normally consolidated deposits.
In general one should obtain several undisturbed tube samples and obtain su values to es-
tablish the likely value(s) of Nk or NkT, since factors such as OCR, grain size, unit weight,
cementing, aging, etc., are significant variables. For normally consolidated clays of low sen-
sitivity (say S, < 4) and Ip < 30 a value of Nk of about 18 and NkT of 14 may be satisfactory
to use in Eq. (3-11) or Eq. (3-13).
Correlations based on a relationship between qc and either IP or the consistency index Ic
[as given in Eq. (2-14a)] have been attempted without much success. Also some attempts
at a correlation between qu and qc have been proposed. Two of these correlations are obtained

from Sarac and Popovic (1982) as follows:
qc = a + blc
qc = 612.6 + 587.5/c kPa % ^
qc = a + bqu
qc = 525.1 + 1.076<?ttkPa
In these equations lc is a decimal quantity, and both qu and qc are in kPa. These two corre-
lations can be as much as ±30 percent in error—f or example, if the computed value is 1000
kPa, the field value can be anywhere in a range of 700 to 1300 kPa.
Sully et al. (1988) give a correlation for the OCR using a piezocone as shown in Fig. 3-
15a with pore pressure sensors installed at the cone base and either on the tip or in the lower
half of the cone face. During a test the tip sensor should read a higher pore pressure than the
sensor at the cone base. Defining this pore pressure difference as PPD gives us
PPD = fe) -(«] (3-16)
W/tip WAase
where uo = in situ static pore pressure ywz in the same units as the pore pressures uc mea-
sured at the cone tip and base. A least squares analysis using a number of soils gives
OCR = 0.66 + 1.43 PPD (3-17)
with a correlation coefficient of r — 0.98 (1.0 would be exact). Sully (1988a) revised Eq.
(3-17) to
OCR = 0.49 + 1.50 PPD (r = 0.96) (Z-YIa)
Again, on a much larger database, Sully (1990) revised Eq. (3-17) to
OCR = 0.50 + 1.50 PPD (3-17*)
The best range of this equation is for OCR < 10. Equations (3-17) were developed using
pore-pressure data in clays, so they probably should not be used for sands. See Eq. (3-19a)
for another equation for OCR applicable for both clay and sand.

3-11.2 CPT Correlations for Cohesionless Soils
Figure 3-20 is a plot of the correlation between cone pressure qc and relative density Dr. This
figure represents the author's composite from references given. The curves are for normally
consolidated cohesionless material. If the soil is overconsolidated, Dr requires correction ac-
cording to Schmertmann (and others). The correction uses the following equations:
^1OCR = 1 + fc/^OCR_1\ ( 3 _ l g )
Qc,nc \ KOtnc J
Schmertmann (1978) suggested that the k term in this equation be 0.75, however, in other
locales a different value may produce a better correlation.
In Eq. (3-18) the K0 ratio might be obtained from Eq. (2-23) rearranged and given here as
a reader convenience:

(2-23)


Figure 3-20 Approximate relationship between cone qc and relative density Dr, as a composite from Schmert-
mann (1978) and Villet and Mitchell (1981) for normally consolidated saturated recent (noncemented) deposits.

Schmertmann suggested using n = 0.42, but later data suggest that n is site-dependent and
may be from 0.32 to 0.52+, perhaps 0.4 for medium dense, 0.48 for dense, and 0.52 for very
dense sands.
If the soil is normally consolidated, Fig. 3-20 can be used directly. For example: at z = 10

f = io kN/m3 measure q

c = 10 MPa; now compute effective stress po = y'z = 10
kN/m3 X 10 m = 100 kPa; and using Fig. 3-20 at the intersection of qc = 10 and p'o = 100
interpolate and obtain Dr ~ 70%).
When the cohesionless deposit is overconsolidated (OCR > 1) the CPT gives qc>ocR which
must be converted using Eq. (3-18) to an equivalent qc>nc in order to use Fig. 3-20. Do this as
follows:

1. First plot Eq. (3-18) using several values of the K0 ratio such as 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 , . . .
about 5 to 6.
2. Find the K0 ratio for the site using one of the procedures given.
3. Enter the chart and project from the plot to the gc-ratio axis and obtain the ratio gc,0CR/#c,nc
as VaI.

Use this value of qc,nc as the cone tip resistance term qc and using the computed value of
in-situ po enter Fig. 3-20 and obtain the overconsolidated value of Dr.
5. Save the plot so that you can plot local data on it to see whether a better correlation can be
obtained.

When the relative density Dr is estimated, use Table 3-4 or Eq. (3-7) to estimate the angle
of internal friction <f>.

Bq, enter Fig. 3-21 for OCR, and then back-compute Eq. (2-23) for the K0 ratio if a suitable
exponent n can be estimated. An equation for the relationship between OCR and Bq for clays

Figure 3-22 is an alternative means to estimate the friction angle 0 using the bearing
capacity factor V'b shown on the figure that is defined as

where p'o = y'z and q'c are both "effective" stresses. The Meyerhof M curve is similar to
those labeled "Eq. 1, 2, and 3" (on Fig. 3-22a), except that the limiting total cone pressure
qci is used instead of V'b for the ordinate axis. In most cases—particularly if the CPT is a
continuous push—qci is the "limiting" total cone bearing pressure qc\.
In the range shown the Meyerhof M curve tends to give larger (^-angles for the same
pressure ratio. In practice one should probably use both figures (a) and (b) and average
the values to obtain a design angle of internal friction $. An approximate equation for

A number of correlations have been proposed for making an SPT TV-blow count estimate
using CPT resistance in both clay and cohesionless materials. The reasons for this are that
there is a larger database of N numbers than qc pressures and that the SPT produces recovered
(but disturbed) soil samples for visual inspection.
All of these correlations used various bridging parameters [desired quantity = A + BN;
r = /(N)], but it was (and still is) difficult to produce anything that one can use with much
confidence. The widespread use of the CPT makes it less important to put much additional
development effort into this type of correlations—rather, plot local data on existing curves to
improve their correlation reliability as much as possible.
Figure 3-23 is the most reliable of the qc-N correlations presently in use. It uses the D50
grain size (the grain size where 50 percent is finer—see Fig. 2-3) as the bridging parameter.
It appears that grain size gives better correlation than any other parameter in coarse-grained
soils.
Some correlations for both clay and cohesionless soils use a generic form of
qc = kN (3-20)
where qc is in units of MPa and coefficient k tends to range from 0.1 to about 1.0 as in the
following table [from Ramaswamy et al. (1982) with some author revisions] which uses N^0:

Soil type qc/N<*
Silts, sandy silts, and slightly cohesive silt-sand mixtures 0.1-0.2
Clean fine to medium sands and slightly silty sands 0.3-0.4

To illustrate the scatter in qc versus A^0, one study found that a best fit for a fine silty sand
was k = 0.77 [see Denver (1982)]. Comparing this value to the foregoing table, where one
might obtain something between 0.1 and 0.4 (since qc/N^0 > qc/N'm), we can see that there
could be a substantial difference in what the soil is typed as.

Example 3-5.
Given. qc = 300 kg/cm2 at depth z = 8 m in sand, y' = 11.15 kN/m3.
Required. Estimate angle of internal friction </>.

Solution.

p'o = 8 X 11.15 = 89.2 kPa (effective pressure)
qc = V'bp'o (from Fig. 3-22a)
V'b = ^j = 300 X ^ ^ = 330 (98.07 converts kg/cm2 to kPa)

From Fig. 3-22a at V'b = 330, we project to curves and down and obtain $> = 34.5 to 39.5°, say,
cf> = 37°. According to Fig. 3-20, qc versus p'o plots into the upper right corner above Dr = 100
and since the maximum Dr = 100 we can with Dr = 100 use Fig. 2-2Ab to obtain </> = 42 to 46°,
say, <j> = 44°. From Fig. 3-22Z? and qc = 300 X 98.07/1000 = 29.4 MPa, we obtain <j> » 46°.
We could use <fi = 44° (which is high; also, it is somewhat doubtful whether the soil really has
Dr = 100). A better estimate might be
4, - ( 3 7 + 434 + 4 6 ) = 42°

The author would probably not use over 40°. Question: Could this soil have OCR > 1?

Example 3-6. Classify the soil on Fig. 3-Ila at the 10- to 12-m depth. Also estimate the undrained
shear strength su if the average y = 19.65 kN/m3 for the entire depth of the CPT. It is known that
the profile is entirely in cohesive soil.

Solution. Enlarge the figure on a copy machine and estimate qc = 11 MPa at the depth of interest
by eye (with this data digitized into a microcomputer we could readily compute the average qc as
the depth increments X qc summed and divided by the depth interval of 2 m).
From qc — 11 MPa = 1 1 000 kPa and //? = 4 percent (from adjacent plot), use Fig. 3-18« and
note the plot into the "silty sand" zone. This zone is evidently stiff from the large qc, so classify as
Soil: stiff, sandy silt (actual soil is a gray, stiff clay, CH)
For s u,
Compute po = y X average depth = 19.65 X 11 = 216 kPa
From Fig. 3-19 estimate Nk = 18 (using our just-made classification for a stiff sandy silt, we would
expect an Ip on the order of 10 or less). With this estimate we can use Eq. (3-11) directly to obtain

3-12 FIELD VANE SHEAR TESTING (FVST)
The vane shear test VST is a substantially used method to estimate the in situ undrained shear
strength of very soft, sensitive, fine-grained soil deposits. It also has considerable application
in offshore soil exploration, particularly when used with sample recovery equipment. Off-
shore equipment configurations are similar to those for the SPT and CPT methods.
The FVST is closely related to the laboratory consolidated-undrained shear strength test;
to identify this test the vane shear strength is usually given the symbol su>v. The undrained
strength basis is justified from the observation that the vane test starts from the current con-
solidated state (unless, of course, the site has been recently filled and is still consolidating).
The test is performed by inserting the vane into the soil and applying a torque after a short
time lapse, on the order of 5 to 10 minutes. If the time lapse is less than this, the insertion
effects reduce the measured sUfV, and if much over this time the soil tends to set up or consol-
idate, with an increase in sUtV.
The vane may be inserted into the stratum being tested from the bottom of a borehole or
pushed without a hole by using a vane sheath similar to a cone penetration test, with the vane
then extended below (and out of) the sheath for the actual test. The vane test is done at a
depth of at least five sheath diameters below the sheath or at least five diameters below the
bottom of a drill hole. Equipment details vary somewhat; however, the vane device shown in
Fig. 3-24a is fairly typical.
Vane blades are on the order of 1.5 to 2.5 mm thick, the shaft body is from about 12.7 to
22 mm in diameter, and the tip is sharpened using a 45° cut (90° vee). The dimensions are
selected to minimize soil disturbance from its insertion—but there is always a small amount
(on the order of 15 to 25 percent) of strength loss. The torque is usually applied through a
suitable gearing device so that a rate of about 6° of rotation per minute can be achieved. The
test is sometimes done using an ordinary torque wrench to apply (and measure) the torque.
Commercial suppliers can provide the torque equipment, extension rods, and bearings as
well as the vane in a package. The angle of rotation 0 and the shear stress T in the shaft from
torque can be quite large if the vane depth is on the order of 6 meters or more. The following
equations for 0 and r are given in most mechanics of materials textbooks as
-i *-?
where 0 = the angle measured at the surface (in radians if computed from the equation)
T = shear stress in shaft extension rods; should not exceed the elastic limit of the
rod material
T = measured torque
L = extension rod lengths from surface to vane
G = shear modulus of elasticity of rods
rr = minimum radius of vane rod
J = torsional moment of inertia of the rods

Use consistent units for all of T, L, G, rr, and J.
Other test details consist in calibrating the torque to account for friction between the
extension rods and support bearings and for soil contamination of the system. The torque to

shear the soil around the perimeter is corrected by calibration, as illustrated in Fig. 3-246. It is
common to continue the vane rotation for 10 to 12 complete revolutions after the peak value
(which occurs at soil rupture) so that the soil in the shear zone is substantially remolded. A
rest period of 1 to 2 min is taken, then a second torque reading is made to obtain the residual
(or remolded) strength. The ratio of these two strengths should be approximately the soil
sensitivity St.
This test has been standardized by ASTM as D 2573, which allows either a rectangular or
a tapered vane and specifies the ratio of h/d = 2.
The generalized test torque (after calibration corrections) for a rectangular-shaped vane
can be written as
r / £ ^ + £ ^ \ ( 3 2 1 )

where d, h = diameter and height of vane blades and in the ratio h/d = 2
a = constant for type of cylinder end shear assumed by user (see Fig. 3-256)
= \ for uniform end shear
= \ for parabolic end shear
= \ for triangular end shear
Su9UU = shear in vertical plane from the perimeter of the vertical vane edges (earlier
in text called sU)V)
su,vh = shear in horizontal plane from the horizontal (or tapered) vane edges. For
a tapered vane this is a combination of the vertical and horizontal shear
strengths
There is some opinion that the shear stress distribution on the vane perimeter parts is as
shown in Fig. 3-25, with stress concentrations at the corners. It is usual to use a constant
shear stress for the cylindrical part (since it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the
stress concentrations). For the ends the stress is commonly described as

" - ^ y
where for easier writing T' = shear stress at some distance r from the center of rotation and
rm is the maximum shear on the end at d/2. Values to use for rm and n are shown in table form
on Fig. 3-25.
For the rectangular vane and uniform end shear T" ( = sUfVh in Fig. 3-25) a general equation
is derived as follows.
The cylinder part (for either a rectangular or tapered vane) is always T\ = sUfVV, computed
as
T1 = n X ird X d/2 X h (Jb)
The top and base resistances for a rectangular vane using a constant shear strength [n = 0
in Eq. (a)] and ignoring the rod diameter, is

If^uA = 0.65^170, one obtains

SutUV = 0.2894 J Q-22b)
Wroth (1984) and later Chandler (1988) suggest that Eq. (3-226) defines the vane shear
strength better than does Eq. (3-22a). On the other hand, Silvestri and Aubertin (1988) used
different-sized vanes and found that, on average,
Su,vh/su,w ~ 1.14 to 1.40
meaning the horizontal shear stress is about 15 to 40 percent larger than the vertical. This
result would mean that anisotropy is significant, at least in some soft soil deposits.
In these equations use T and d in consistent units. For example in Eq. (3-22a), if T =
300 N m and d = 65 mm (0.065 m) we have the shear stress su,vv = (0.2728)(0.30)/3.0653 =
298 kN/m2 (kPa). Here, by use of Eq. (3-22a) it is explicitly assumed the soil is "isotropic"
W l u l ISI^UU SjiyVh*
For the tapered vane, Eq. (b) is still valid; however, the end slopes (always 45° as in Fig.
3-25) produce two truncated cones. The shear stress equation is developed as follows.
The average radius rav and moment arm of any truncated cone is

_ d + J1

The lengths of the 45° conical slope are

The bottom cone base (small-diameter circular area) moment is

bcm = TTjt

The torque (assuming sUrVV = average shear stress on all the parts) is
T = cylinder + 2 ends + cone base

and substituting for rav and s, we obtain
- = S11J^ + ^ - dd\ + J1J2 - d\) + ^ ] (3-23)
Rearranging, combining terms where possible, and solving for the undrained vane shear
strength sUiV, and with h = 2d; l/ir = 0.3183; Jl/A = 0.354; and 1/12 = 0.0833, we ob-
tain

(3-24)


where in all these equations d = vane diameter
d\ = shaft diameter at vane, usually about 12 to 22 mm. Equa-
tion (3-24) is greatly simplified if the dd\ terms are ne-
glected.
T = measured torque

Use consistent units of T in N-m with d in m, or T in N-mm with d in mm. Use kN instead
of N if numbers become very large.
Somewhat similar to the SPT, the vane test is usually performed every 0.5 to 1 m of depth in
soft clays and fine silty sands. The test is not well suited for dense, hard, or gravelly deposits.
The generic forms of Eq. (3-24) allow the user to perform two tests in the stratum using
different vane dimensions to obtain estimates of both sUiVV and su>vh. This is seldom done,
however, and either the soil is assumed isotropic or the horizontal shear strength sUtVh is some
fraction (say, 0.5, 0.6, etc.) of the vertical strength sUtVV.
It appears that the FVST does not identify the OCR very well. This fact was ascertained
from plotting the vane strength ratio Vr = sUfVV/CKoUC triaxial test versus Ip to obtain
Vr = 0.55 + 0.008/p (3-25)
which is only marginally dependent on the OCR ratio. The normalized field vane strength
may be approximated [see Chandler (1988)] as
^ = Si(OCR)"1 (3-26)

For normally consolidated clays m « 0.95 (with a range of 0.8 to 1.35) and S\ ~ 0.25 (with
a range of 0.16 to 0.33), which for the database used gives values within ±25 percent.
The FVST seems to give a value of sUtV that is too large for design. Bjerrum (1972) back-
computed a number of embankment failures on soft clay and suggested using
^M,design = "-Suv (J-Z/)
where the reduction factor A is given on Fig. 3-26 and sUtV is the sUtVV used to this point. Ladd
et al. (1977) added additional data to support Fig. 3-26 but observed that there was substantial
scatter in the points. Aas et al. (1986) restudied the Bjerrum chart, to include OCR and aging,
and produced the revised chart of Fig. 3-26fc. Both charts are included, since Bjerrum's chart
has been widely used; however, the revised Aas chart appears more rational. Lefebvre et al.
(1988) studied two soft, sensitive clays with a low Ip and found that for cases where Ip < 20
the Bjerrum A-factor of Eq. (3-27) might be larger than 1. This study also found that the
original Bjerrum curve (Fig. 3-26a) might be more nearly correct than the Aas revision (Fig.
3-26b). Evidently correlations between su>v from the vane test and from the laboratory (or
other field methods) are very dependent on test methodology (type of test, soil strain rate
from the test method, soil type, history, etc.) as well as other factors. For example, others [see
Arman et al. (1975) and Foott et al. (1980)] have found the measured vane strength sUfV to
be too large—on the order of 2qu. Walker (1986), however, found a reasonable correlation
between sUtV and laboratory triaxial tests (with the caveat that the vane test is difficult to
perform at depths much over 10m).
Some professionals in this field believe that anisotropy is a significant factor in the mea-
sured versus design values of sUtV. Thus, generic forms of the equations are provided should

there be a need to attempt to obtain separate values for the vertical and horizontal shear
strengths, somewhat similar to that attempted by Garga and Khan (1992).
Since the FVST, like the CPT, does not recover samples for visual classification or for
confirmation tests, it is usually necessary to obtain samples by some alternative test method.
This step might be omitted if the geotechnical engineer has done other work in the vicinity
of the current exploration.

The test proceeds by expanding the serrated cylinder halves into the soil by applying pres-
sure from the surface through a piping system. Next the cylinder is pulled with the pulling
load and displacements recorded. The expansion pressure is an and the pulling load can be
converted to the shear strength s to make a plot as in Fig. 2-21 b to obtain the in situ strength
parameters </> and c.
Figure 3-27 illustrates the essential details of the test, which was developed by Dr. R.
Handy at Iowa State University around 1967 and is sometimes called the Iowa Borehole
Shear Test. The test undoubtedly is a drained shear test where the soil is relatively free-
draining, since the drainage path from the shear head serrations is short and if the test is
performed in the displacement range of about 0.5 mm/min or less. This rate might be too fast,
however, for saturated clays, and Demartinecourt and Bauer (1983) have proposed adding a
pore-pressure transducer to the shear heads and motorizing the pull (which was initially done
by hand cranking with reduction gearing). With pore pressure measurements it is possible to
obtain both total and effective stress parameters from any borehole shear test. Handy (1986)
describes the BST in some detail, including its usefulness in collecting data for slope stability
analyses.
The BST is applicable for all fine-grained soils and may be done even where a trace of
gravel is present. It has particular appeal if a good-quality borehole can be produced and for
modest depths in lieu of "undisturbed" sample recovery and laboratory testing.

3-14 THE FLAT DILATOMETER TEST (DMT)
This test consists of inserting the dilatometer probe of Fig. 3-28 to the depth of interest z by
pushing or driving. The CPT pushing equipment can be used for insertion of the device, and
in soils where the SPT TV is greater than 35 to 40 the device can be driven or pushed from the
bottom of a predrilled borehole using SPT drilling and testing equipment.

Making a DMT after insertion to the depth of interest uses the following steps:

1. Take a pressure reading at the membrane in the dilatometer just flush with the plate (termed
at liftoff), make appropriate zero corrections, and call this pressure p\. The operator gets
a signal at liftoff.
2. Increase the probe pressure until the membrane expands Ad = 1.1 mm into the adjacent
soil and correct this pressure as /?2. Again the operator receives a signal so the pressure
reading can be taken.
3. Decrease the pressure and take a reading when the membrane has returned to the liftoff
position and correct for pi,. According to Schmertmann (1986) this latter reading can be
related to excess pore pressure.

The probe is then pushed to the next depth position, which is from 150 to 200 mm (or
more) further down, and another set of readings taken. A cycle takes about 2 minutes, so a
10-m depth can be probed in about 30 minutes including setup time.
Data are reduced to obtain the following:

1. Dilatometer modulus Ep. According to Marchetti (1980) we have
= 2D(P2 - P l ) A - ^ N
\ Es )
and for Ad = 1.1 mm, D = 60 mm (see Fig. 3-28) we have on rearranging

ED = y^-2 = 34.7(p2 - Pi) (3-28)

2. The lateral stress index KD is defined as

KD = ELZJL = EL (3-29)
Po Po
3. The material or deposit index ID is defined as
j = P1Z11 ( 3 _3 0 )
p2~u
The effective overburden pressure p'o = y'z must be computed in some manner by estimating
the unit weight of the soil or taking tube samples for a more direct determination. The pore
pressure u may be computed as the static pressure from the GWT, which must also be known
or estimated.
The DMT modulus ED is related to Es as shown in Eq. (3-28) and includes the effect of
Poisson's ratio /x, which must be estimated if Es is computed. The ED modulus is also related
to mv of Eq. (2-34) from a consolidation test and thus has some value in making an estimate
of consolidation settlements in lieu of performing a laboratory consolidation test.
The lateral stress index KD is related to K0 and therefore indirectly to the OCR. Determi-
nation of K0 is approximate since the probe blade of finite thickness has been inserted into
the soil. Figure 3-29 may be used to estimate K0 from KD- Baldi et al. (1986) give some
equations that they claim offer some improvement over those shown in Fig. 3-29; however,

difficult to determine at any reasonable test depth.
The material or deposit index ID is related (with ED) as illustrated in Fig. 3-30 to the soil
type and state or consistency.

the area being tested or that the DMT data be supplemented with information obtained from

Here the depths shown are from 2.1 to 2.7 m. The probe push ranged from 1,400 kg to 980
kg (the soil became softer) and, as should be obvious, values of p2 are greater than p\. With
the GWT at the ground surface the static pore pressure u is directly computed as 9.807z/100
to obtain u in bars.
According to both Marchetti (1980) and Schmertmann (1986) the DMT can be used to
obtain the fiill range of soil parameters (ED, K0, OCR, su, 0, and mv) for both strength and
compressibility analyses.

3-15 THE PRESSUREMETER TEST (PMT)
The borehole pressuremeter test is an in situ test developed ca. 1956 [Menard (1956)] where
a carefully prepared borehole that is sufficiently—but not over about 10 percent—oversized
is used. The pressuremeter probe consisting of three parts (top, cell, and bottom) as shown in
Fig. 3-3Ia is then inserted and expanded to and then into the soil. The top and bottom guard
cells are expanded to reduce end-condition effects on the middle (the cell) part, which is used
to obtain the volume versus cell pressure relationship used in data reduction.
A pressuremeter test is not a trivial task, as fairly high pressures are involved and cali-
brations for pressure and volume losses must be made giving data to plot curves as in Fig.
3-32a. These data are used to correct the pressure-volume data taken during a test so that
a curve such as Fig. 3-32b can be made. It is evident that a microcomputer can be used to
considerable advantage here by installing the calibration data in memory. With the probe data
directly input, the data can be automatically reduced and, with a plot routine, the curve can
be developed as the test proceeds.
The interested reader should refer to Winter (1982) for test and calibration details and to
Briaud and Gambin (1984) for borehole preparation (which is extremely critical). It should
be evident that the PMT can only be performed in soils where the borehole can be shaped and
will stand open until the probe is inserted. Although the use of drilling mud/fluid is possible,
hole quality cannot be inspected and there is the possibility of a mud layer being trapped
between the cell membrane and the soil. Another factor of some to considerable concern is
that the soil tends to expand into the cavity when the hole is opened so that the test often has
considerable disturbance effects included.
To overcome the problems of hole preparation and soil expansion, self-boring pressureme-
ters were almost simultaneously developed in France [Baguelin et al. (1974)] and England
[Wroth (1975)]. The self-boring pressuremeter test (SBPMT) is qualitatively illustrated in
Fig. 3-316 and c.

The pressuremeter operates on the principle of expanding a rigid cylinder into the soil
and being resisted by an infinitely thick cylinder (the soil). The basic equation in terms of
volumetric strain ev is

where terms not previously defined are
ri, Ar = initial radius at contact with hole and change in hole radius, respectively
p = cell expansion pressure in units of Es

In practice we obtain the slope (AV/Ap) from the linear part of the cell pressure versus volume
plot and rearrange Eq. (3-31) to obtain the lateral static shear modulus as

U 2(1+ /x) V°AV ( 3 J 2 )
where V0 = volume of the measuring cell at average pressure Ap = V0 + Vc
Ap9 AV = as defined on Fig. 3-32b along with a sample computation for G'

The pressuremeter modulus Esp is then computed using an estimated value of /x as Esp =
E5 = G'[2(l + /A)]. Unless the soil is isotropic this lateral E5 is different from the vertical
value usually needed for settlement analyses. For this reason the pressuremeter modulus Esp
usually has more application for laterally loaded piles and drilled caissons.
The value ph shown on Fig. 3-32b is usually taken as the expansion pressure of the cell
membrane in solid contact with the soil and is approximately the in situ lateral pressure (de-
pending on procedure and insertion disturbance). If we take this as the in situ lateral pressure,
then it is a fairly simple computation to obtain K0 as

K0 = ^- (3-33)
Po
which would be valid using either total or effective stresses (total is shown in the equation). It
is necessary to estimate or somehow determine the unit weight of the several strata overlying
the test point so that po can be computed.
With suitable interpretation of data as shown on Fig. 3-32b and replotting, one can estimate
the undrained shear strength S1^1, for clay [see Ladanyi (1972) for theory, example data, and
computations] and the angle of internal friction <f> [Ladanyi (1963), Winter and Rodriguez
(1975)] for cohesionless soils.
It appears that the pressuremeter gives s^p which are consistently higher than determined
by other methods. They may be on the order of 1.5 to 1.7s^ (and we already reduce the
vane shear strength by As11^). The PMT also appears to give values on the order of 1.3 to
1-5^tJi3xJaI.
The pressuremeter seems to have best applications in the same soils that are suitable for
the CPT and DMT, that is, relatively fine-grained sedimentary deposits. In spite of the ap-
parently considerable potential of this device, inconsistencies in results are common. Clough
[see Benoit and Clough (1986) with references] has made an extensive study of some of
the variables, of which both equipment configuration and user technique seem to be critical
parameters.

3-16 OTHER METHODS FOR IN SITU K0
The Glotzl cell of Fig. 3-33 is a device to measure K0 in soft clays. It is pushed to about 300
mm above the test depth in the protective metal sheath, then the blade is extended to the test
depth. The device is 100 X 200 mm long X 4 mm thick [Massarsch (1975)]. The cell contains
oil, which is pressurized from the surface to obtain the expansion pressure = lateral pressure.
According to Massarsch (1975) and Massarsch et al. (1975), one should wait about a week
for the excess pore pressure from the volume displacement to dissipate. It may be noted that
the DMT, which has a displacement volume of about four times this device, uses no time
delay for pore-pressure dissipation.
The Iowa stepped blade [Handy et al. (1982)] of Fig. 3-34 can be used to estimate K0
somewhat indirectly. In use the first step (3-mm part) is inserted at the depth of interest and
a pressure reading taken. The blade is then pushed so the next step is at the point of interest
and a reading taken, etc., for the four steps. Data of pressure versus blade thickness t can be
plotted using a semilog scale as in Fig. 3-34. The best-fit curve can be extended to t = 0 to
obtain the in situ lateral pressure ph so that K0 can be computed using Eq. (3-33).
Lutenegger and Timian (1986) found that for some soils the thicker steps gave smaller
pressure readings than for the previous step (with thinner blade). This result was attributed
to the soil reaching its "limiting pressure" and resulted in increasing the original three-step
blade to one now using four steps. This limit pressure is illustrated on the pressuremeter
curve of Fig. 3-32fe. Noting the stepped blade goes from 3 to 7.5 mm and the flat dilatometer

has a thickness of 14 mm we can well ask why this apparent limit pressure does not develop
with the thicker—but tapered—dilatometer blade. It may be that the blade steps produce a
different stress pattern in the ground than the tapered DMT blade.
Hydraulic fracture is a method that may be used in both rock and clay soils. It cannot
be used in cohesionless soils with large coefficients of permeability. Water under pressure is
pumped through a piezometer that has been carefully installed in a borehole to sustain con-
siderable hydraulic pressure before a breakout occurs in the soil around the piezometer point.
At a sufficiently high hydraulic pressure a crack will develop in the soil at the level of water
injection. At this time the water pressure will rapidly drop and level off at an approximate
constant pressure and flow rate. Closing the system will cause a rapid drop in pressure as the
water flows out through the crack in the wall of the boring. The crack will then close as the
pressure drops to some value with a resulting decrease in flow from the piezometer system.
By close monitoring of the system and making a plot as in Fig. 3-35/?, one can approximate
the pressure at which the crack opens.
Steps in performing a fracture test are as follows (refer to Fig. 3-35«):

1. Prepare a saturated piezometer with a 6-mm standpipe tube filled with deaerated water
with the top plugged and pushed to the desired depth L using a series of drill rods. The
plug will keep water from flowing into the system under excess pore pressure developed
by pushing the piezometer into the ground.
2. Measure Lw and Lf, and compute depth of embedment of piezometer and transducer volt-
age V.
3. After about \ hr unplug the 6-mm standpipe tube and connect the fracture apparatus to
the standpipe using an appropriate tube connector at G.
4. Fill the fracture system with deaerated water from the 1- or 2-liter reservoir bottle by
opening and closing the appropriate valves. Use the hand-operated pump/metering device
to accomplish this.
5. Take a zero reading on the pressure transducer—usually in millivolts, mV.

6. Apply system pressure at a slow rate using the hand pump until fracture occurs as observed
by a sudden drop-off in pressure.
7. Quickly close valve E.
8. From the plot of pressure transducer readings versus time, the break in the curve is inter-
preted as relating to cr3.

Lefebvre et al. (1991) used a series of field tests in soils with apparently known OCRs in
the range of 1.6 to 4.8 to see the effect of piezometer tip size and what range of K0 might be
obtained. The tests appear to establish that K0 -> 1.0 when the OCR is on the order of 2.1.
The K0 values ranged from about 0.59 to 3.70 and were generally higher as OCR increased,
but not always for the smaller OCR. In the low-OCR region a K0 = 0.59 was found for OCR
= 1.7, whereas a value of 0.88 was found for OCR = 1.6. These variations were likely due
to soil anomalies or correctness of the "known" OCR.
This test may also be performed in rock, but for procedures the reader should consult
Jaworski et al. (1981).
The following example is edited from Bozozuk (1974) to illustrate the method of obtaining
K0 from a fracture test in soil.
Example 3-7. Data from a hydraulic fracture test are as follows (refer to Fig. 3-35):
Length of casing used = L^ + z = 6.25 m
Distance from top of casing to ground Lf = 1.55 m
Distance Ln, measured inside drill rods (or standpipe) with a probe = 2.02 m
Saturated unit weight of soil, assuming groundwater nearly to surface and
S = 100 percent for full depth, y ^ = 17.12kN/m3

y measured when fracture apparatus connected = 0.265 m
The pressure transducer output is calibrated to 12.162 kPa/mV.

Required. Find the at-rest earth-pressure coefficient K0.

Solution.

z = 6.25 - 2.02 = 4.23 m (see Fig. 3-35a)
Lwi = Lw-y = 2.02 - 0.265 = 1.755 m
Total soil depth to piezometer tip, hs = Lw + z — Lf
= 6.25 - 1.55 = 4.70 m
Total overburden pressure, po = ySat^
= 17.12(4.70) = 80.46 kPa
This po assumes soil is saturated from the ground surface. Now we compute the static pore pressure
uo before test starts:
Uo = ZJw = 4.23(9.807) = 41.98 kPa
The effective pressure is expressed as

Po = Po- U0
= 80.46 - 41.48 = 38.98 kPa
Since hs = 4.70 and z = 4.23 m, the GWT is 0.47 m below ground surface. With some capillary
rise, the use of ysat = 17.12 kN/m3 for full depth of hs produces negligible error.
The fracture pressure is a constant X the reading (of 1.84), giving
FP = (12.162 kPa/mV)(l.84 mV) = 22.38 kPa
The additional pore pressure from water in the piezometer above the existing GWT is
Uwi = Lwi7w = 1.755(9.807) = 17.21 kPa
Total pore pressure ut is the sum of the measured value FP and the static value of uwi just computed,
giving
ut = FP + uwi = 22.38 + 17.21 = 39.59 kPa
K0 = q\Jqv
And using ut = qn and qv = p'o, we can compute K0 as
K0 = total pore pressure//?^ = ut/p'o
= 39.59/38.98 = 1.03
This value of K0 is larger than 1.00, so this example may not be valid. To verify these com-
putations, use a copy machine to enlarge Fig. 3-35<a, then put the known and computed values
on it.
////
Considerable research has been done on hydraulic fracture theory to produce a method
that can be used to predict hydraulic fracture in soil more reliably. In addition to estimating
the OCR and ko there is particular application in offshore oil production, where a large head
of drilling fluid may produce hydraulic fracture (and loss of fluid) into the soil being drilled.
A recent summary of this work is given by Anderson et al. (1994).


3-17 ROCKSAMPLING
In rock, except for very soft or partially decomposed sandstone or limestone, blow counts are
at the refusal level (N > 100). If samples for rock quality or for strength testing are required it
will be necessary to replace the soil drill with rock drilling equipment. Of course, if the rock is
close to the ground surface, it will be necessary to ascertain whether it represents a competent
rock stratum or is only a suspended boulder(s). Where rock is involved, it is useful to have
some background in geology. A knowledge of the area geology will be useful to detect rock
strata versus suspended boulders, whose size can be approximately determined by probing
(or drilling) for the outline. A knowledge of area geology is also useful to delineate both the
type of rock and probable quality (as sound, substantially fractured from earth movements,
etc.). This may save considerable expense in taking core samples, since their quantity and
depth are dependent on both anticipated type and quality of the rock.
Rock cores are necessary if the soundness of the rock is to be established; however, cores
smaller than those from the AWT core bit (Table 3-6) tend to break up inside the drill barrel.
Larger cores also have a tendency to break up (rotate inside the barrel and degrade), especially
if the rock is soft or fissured. Drilling small holes and injecting colored grout (a water-cement
mixture) into the seams can sometimes be used to recover relatively intact samples. Colored
grout outlines the fissure, and with some care the corings from several adjacent corings can
be used to orient the fissure(s).
Unconfined and high-pressure triaxial tests can be performed on recovered cores to de-
termine the elastic properties of the rock. These tests are performed on pieces of sound rock
from the core sample and may give much higher compressive strengths in laboratory testing
than the "effective" strength available from the rock mass, similar to results in fissured clay.
Figure 3-36 illustrates several commonly used drill bits, which are attached to a piece of
hardened steel tube (casing) 0.6 to 3 m long. In the drilling operation the bit and casing rotate
while pressure is applied, thus grinding a groove around the core. Water under pressure is
forced down the barrel and into the bit to carry the rock dust out of the hole as the water is
circulated.
The recovery ratio term used earlier also has significance for core samples. A recovery
ratio near 1.0 usually indicates good-quality rock. In badly fissured or soft rocks the recovery
ratio may be 0.5 or less.

Rock quality designation (RQD) is an index or measure of the quality of a rock mass
[Stagg and Zienkiewicz (1968)] used by many engineers. RQD is computed from recovered
core samples as

_ X Lengths of intact pieces of core > 100 mm
Length of core advance
For example, a core advance of 1500 mm produced a sample length of 1310 mm consisting of
dust, gravel, and intact pieces of rock. The sum of lengths of pieces 100 mm or larger9 (pieces
vary from gravel to 280 mm) in length is 890 mm. The recovery ratio Lr = 1310/1500 =
0.87 and RQD = 890/1500 = 0.59.
The rating of rock quality may be used to approximately establish the field reduction of
modulus of elasticity and/or compressive strength and the following may be used as a guide:

be broken into shorter fragments by hand.

Depth of Rock Cores
There are no fast rules for rock core depths. Generally one should core approximately as
follows:
1. A depth sufficient to locate sound rock or to ascertain that it is fractured and jointed to a
very great depth.
2. For heavily loaded members such as piles or drilled piers, a depth of approximately 3 to
4 m below the location of the base. The purpose is to check that the "sound" rock does
not have discontinuities at a lower depth in the stress influence zone and is not a large
suspended boulder.
Local building codes may give requirements for coring; however, more often they give
allowable bearing pressures that can be used if one can somehow ascertain the rock quality
without coring.
Adjacent core holes can be used to obtain relative rock quality by comparing cross-hole
seismic wave velocities in situ to laboratory values on intact samples. If the field value is
less, it indicates fractures and jointing in the rock mass between holes. Down-hole and surface
methods are of little value in this procedure, since a part of the wave travel is in the overlaying
soil and separating the two with any confidence is nearly impossible.

3-18 GROUNDWATER TABLE (GWT) LOCATION
Groundwater affects many elements of foundation design and construction, so the GWT
should be established as accurately as possible if it is within the probable construction zone;
otherwise, it is only necessary to determine where it is not. For the latter case the location
within ±0.3 to 0.5 m is usually adequate.
Soil strength (or bearing pressure) is usually reduced for foundations located below the
water table. Foundations below the water table will be uplifted by the water pressure, and
of course some kind of dewatering scheme must be employed if the foundations are to be
constructed "in the dry."
The GWT is generally determined by directly measuring to the stabilized water level in
the borehole after a suitable time lapse, often 24 to 48 hr later. This measurement is done
by lowering a weighted tape down the hole until water contact is made. In soils with a high
permeability, such as sands and gravels, 24 hr is usually a sufficient time for the water level
to stabilize unless the hole wall has been somewhat sealed with drilling mud.
In soils with low permeability such as silts, fine silty sands, and clays, it may take sev-
eral days to several weeks (or longer) for the GWT to stabilize. In this case an alternative is to


install a piezometer (small vertical pipe) with a porous base and a removable top cap in the
borehole. Backfill is then carefully placed around the piezometer so that surface water cannot
enter the boring. This procedure allows periodic checking until the water level stabilizes, that
is, the depth to the water has not changed since the previous water level measurement was
taken. Clearly this method will be expensive because of the additional labor involved in the
installation and subsequent depth checks.
In theory we might do the following:

1. Plot the degree of saturation S with depth if it is possible to compute it reliably. A direct
plot of the in situ water content may be useful, but for S = 100 percent wN can decrease
as the void ratio decreases from overburden pressure.
2. Fill the hole and bail it out. After bailing a quantity, observe whether the water level in the
hole is rising or falling. The true level is between the bailed depth where the water was
falling and the bailed depth where it is rising. This method implies a large permeability,
so it would be more practical simply to bail the hole, then move to the next boring location
while the GWT stabilizes.
One may apply a computational method; however, this requires capping the hole and tak-
ing periodic depth measurements to the water table (as done for direct measurements), and
since no one (to the author's knowledge) computes the depth, the computational method is
no longer given. This method was given in the first through third editions of this book.

3-19 NUMBER AND DEPTH OF BORINGS
There are no clear-cut criteria for determining directly the number and depth of borings (or
probings) required on a project in advance of some subsurface exploration. For buildings a
minimum of three borings, where the surface is level and the first two borings indicate regular
stratification, may be adequate. Five borings are generally preferable (at building corners and
center), especially if the site is not level. On the other hand, a single boring may be sufficient
for an antenna or industrial process tower base in a fixed location with the hole made at the
point.
Four or five borings are sufficient if the site soil is nonuniform (both to determine this and
for the exploration program). This number will usually be enough to delineate a layer of soft
clay (or a silt or peat seam) and to determine the properties of the poorest material so that a
design can be made that adequately limits settlements for most other situations.
Additional borings may be required in very uneven sites or where fill areas have been
made and the soil varies horizontally rather than vertically. Even though the geotechnical
engineer may be furnished with a tentative site plan locating the building(s), often these are
still in the stage where horizontal relocations can occur, so the borings should be sufficiently
spread to allow this without having to make any (or at least no more than a few) additional
borings.
In practice, the exploration contract is somewhat open as to the number of borings. The
drilling operation starts. Based on discovery from the first holes (or CPT, DMT, etc.) the
drilling program advances so that sufficient exploration is made for the geotechnical engineer
to make a design recommendation that has an adequate margin of safety and is economically
feasible for the client. Sometimes the exploration, particularly if preliminary, discloses that
the site is totally unsuitable for the intended construction.


Borings should extend below the depth where the stress increase from the foundation load
is significant. This value is often taken as 10 percent (or less) of the contact stress qo. For the
square footing of Fig. \-\a the vertical pressure profile shows this depth to be about 2B. Since
footing sizes are seldom known in advance of the borings, a general rule of thumb is 2 x the
least lateral plan dimensions of the building or 10 m below the lowest building elevation.
Where the 2 X width is not practical as, say, for a one-story warehouse or department store,
boring depths of 6 to 15 m may be adequate. On the other hand, for important (or high-rise)
structures that have small plan dimensions, it is common to extend one or more of the borings
to bedrock or to competent (hard) soil regardless of depth. It is axiomatic that at least one of
the borings for an important structure terminate into bedrock if there are intermediate strata
of soft or compressible materials.
Summarizing, there are no binding rules on either the number or the depth of exploratory
soil borings. Each site must be carefully considered with engineering judgment in combina-
tion with site discovery to finalize the program and to provide an adequate margin of safety.

3-20 DRILLING AND/OR EXPLORATION OF CLOSED
LANDFILLS OR HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES
Seldom is a soil exploration done to place a structure over a closed landfill or hazardous waste
site. Where exploration is necessary, extreme caution is required so that the drilling crew is
not exposed to hazardous materials brought to the surface by the drill. Various gases that may
be dangerous if inhaled or subject to explosion from a chance spark may also exit the drill
hole. In addition to providing the drilling crew with protective clothing it may be necessary
also to provide gas masks.
When drilling these sites, it is necessary to attempt to ascertain what types of materials
might be buried in the fill. It is also of extreme importance that the drilling procedure not
penetrate any protective lining, which would allow leachate contained in the fill to escape
into the underlying soil or groundwater. If the boring is to penetrate the protective liner, it
is absolutely essential to obtain approval from the appropriate governmental agencies of the
procedure to use to avoid escape of the fill leachate. This approval is also necessary to give
some protection against any litigation (which is very likely to occur). At the current (1995)
level of drilling technology there is no known drilling procedure that will give an absolute
guarantee that leachate will not escape if a drill hole is advanced through a protective liner,
even if casing is used.

3-21 THE SOIL REPORT
When the borings or other field work has been done and any laboratory testing completed, the
geotechnical engineer then assembles the data for a recommendation to the client. Computer
analyses may be made where a parametric study of the engineering properties of the soil is
necessary to make a "best" value(s) recommendation of the following:

1. Soil strength parameters of angle of internal friction <f> and cohesion c
2. Allowable bearing capacity (considering both strength and probable or tolerable settle-
ments)
3. Engineering parameters such as Es, JJL, G', or ks.


A plan and profile of the borings may be made as on Fig. 3-37, or the boring information
may be compiled from the field and laboratory data sheets as shown on Fig. 3-38. Field and
data summary sheets are far from standardized between different organizations [see Bowles
(1984), Fig. 6-6 for similar presentation], and further, the ASTM D 653 (Standard Terms and
Symbols Relating to Soil and Rock) is seldom well followed.
In Fig. 3-38 the units are shown in Fps because the United States has not converted as
of this date (1995) to SI. On the left is the visual soil description as given by the drilling
supervisor. The depth scale is shown to identify stratum thickness; the glacial silty clay till is
found from 6 in. to nearly 12 ft (about 11 ft thick). The SS indicates that split spoon samples
were recovered. The N column shows for each location the blows to seat the sampler 6 in. (150
mm) and to drive it for the next two 6-in. (150-mm) increments. At the 3-ft depth it took five
blows to drive the split spoon 6 in., then 10 and 15 each for the next two 6-in. increments—
the total Af count = 1 0 + 1 5 = 25 as shown. A pocket penetrometer was used to obtain the
unconfined compression strength of samples from the split spoon (usually 2+ tests) with the
average shown as Qp. At the 3-ft depth Qp = qu = 4.5+ ton/ft2 (43O+ kPa). The pocket
penetrometers currently in use read directly in both ton/ft2 and kg/cm2, the slight difference
between the two units being negligible (i.e., 1 ton/ft2 ~ 1 kg/cm2) and ignored. The next
column is the laboratory-determined Qu = qu values, and for the 3-ft depth qu = 7.0 tsf
(670 kPa). Based on the natural water content Mc = w^ = 15 percent, the dry unit weight
Dd = 7d = 121 lb/ft3 (or 19.02 kN/m3). The GWT appears to be at about elevation 793.6 ft.
Note that a hollow-stem continuous-flight auger was used, so that the SPT was done without
using casing.
The client report is usually bound with a durable cover. The means of presentation can
range from simple stapling to binding using plastic rings. At a minimum the report generally
contains the following:

1. Letter of transmittal.
2. Title.
3. Table of contents.
4. Narrative of work done and recommendations. This may include a foldout such as Fig.
3-37. The narrative points out possible problems and is usually written in fairly general
terms because of possible legal liabilities. The quality varies widely. The author used one
in which the four-page narrative consisted of three pages of "hard sell" to use the firm for
some follow-up work.
5. Summary of findings (and recommendations). This is usually necessary so that after the
generalities of the narrative the client can quickly find values to use. Some clients may
not read the narrative very carefully.

PROBLEMS
Problems are in order of text coverage.
3-1. Sound cohesive samples from the SPT (returned to the laboratory in glass jars) were obtained
for a y determination using a 500 mL (mL = cm3) volume jar as follows:

Trimmed Water added,
Boring Depth, m weight, g cm3
B-I 6.00 142.3 426
B-3 8.00 145.2 427

i.e., weighed samples put in volume jar and water shown
added. Volume of first sample = 500 — 426 = 74 cm3

Required: Estimate the average unit weight of the clay stratum from depth = 5 to 9 m. If the
GWT is at 2 m depth, what is ydry? Hint: Assume G5.
Answer: y ^ « 19.18 kN/m3; ydry = 14.99 kN/m3.
3-2. What are po and p'o at the 9-m depth of Prob. 3-1 if y = 17.7 kN/m3 for the first 2 m of depth
above the GWT?
Answer: p'o = 101.0 kPa.
3-3. Compute the area ratio of the standard split spoon dimensions shown on Fig. 3-5a. W^hat ID
would be required to give Ar = 10 percent?
3-4. The dimensions of two thin-walled sample tubes (from supplier's catalog) are as follows:

OD, mm ID, mm Length, mm

76.2 73 610
89 86 610

Required: What is the area ratio of each of these two sample tubes? What kind of sample distur-
bance might you expect using either tube size?
Answer: Ar = 8.96,7.1 percent
3-5. A thin-walled tube sampler was pushed into a soft clay at the bottom of a borehole a distance
of 600 mm. When the tube was recovered, a measurement down inside the tube indicated a
recovered sample length of 585 mm. What is the recovery ratio, and what (if anything) happened
to the sample? If the 76.2 mm OD tube of Prob. 3-4 was used, what is the probable sample
quality?
3-6. Make a plot of CN (of Sec. 3-7) for p'o from 50 to 1000 kPa.
3-7. From a copy of Table 3-4 remove the N10 values and replace them with N^0 values. Comment
on whether this improves or degrades the value of the table.
3-8. Discuss why Table 3-5 shows that the clays from consistency "medium" to "hard" show probable
OCR > 1 where the soft clays are labeled "young."
3-9. If N10 = 25 and p'o = 100 kPa, for Eq. (3-5«), what is Drl What is your best estimate for Dr if
the OCR = 3? Estimate </> from Table 3-4 for a medium (coarse) sand.
3-10. Referring to Fig. P3-10 and Table 3-4, make reasonable estimates of the relative density Dr and
<f> for the sand both above (separately) and below the GWT shown. Assume Er — 60 for the Af
values shown. Assume the unit weight of the sand increases linearly from 15 to 18.1 kN/m3 from


near surface to the water table and ysat = 19.75 kN/m3 below the GWT. Estimate the N value
you would use for a footing that is 2 X 2 m located at the - 2 m depth.

4-1 INTRODUCTION
The soil must be capable of carrying the loads from any engineered structure placed upon it
without a shear failure and with the resulting settlements being tolerable for that structure.
This chapter will be concerned with evaluation of the limiting shear resistance, or ultimate
bearing capacity qu\u of the soil under a foundation load. Chapter 5 will be concerned with
estimation of settlements. A soil shear failure can result in excessive building distortion and
even collapse. Excessive settlements can result in structural damage to a building frame,
nuisances such as sticking doors and windows, cracks in tile and plaster, and excessive wear
or equipment failure from misalignment resulting from foundation settlements.
Seldom has a structure collapsed or tilted over from a base shear failure in recent times.
Most reported base failures have occurred under embankments or similar structures where a
low factor of safety was deemed acceptable. Most structural distress attributed to poor foun-
dation design is from excessive settlements. Even here, however, structural collapse seldom
occurs. This may in part be due to settlements being time-dependent, so that when cracks or
other evidence first appears, there is sufficient time to take remedial measures.
It is necessary to investigate both base shear resistance and settlements for any structure.
In many cases settlement criteria will control the allowable bearing capacity; however, there
are also a number of cases where base shear (in which a base punches into the ground—
usually with a simultaneous rotation) dictates the recommended bearing capacity. Structures
such as liquid storage tanks and mats are often founded on soft soils, which are usually more
susceptible to base shear failure than to settlement. Base shear control, to avoid a combina-
tion base punching with rotation into the soil, is often of more concern than settlement for
these foundation types. These base types are often uniformly loaded so that nearly uniform
settlements are produced across the base. Uniform settlements—even if relatively large—can
usually be tolerated for either rigid mats (beneath buildings) or flexible mats beneath liquid
storage tanks.

OF FOUNDATIONS

CHAPTER
4


We should note that although our primary focus here is on estimating the ultimate bearing
capacity for framed structures and equipment foundations, the same principles apply to ob-
taining the bearing capacity for other structures such as tower bases, dams, and fills. It will
be shown that the ultimate bearing capacity is more difficult to estimate for layered soils,
foundations located on or near slopes, and foundations subjected to tension loads.
The recommendation for the allowable bearing capacity qa to be used for design is based
on the minimum of either

1. Limiting the settlement to a tolerable amount (see Chap. 5)
2, The ultimate bearing capacity, which considers soil strength, as computed in the following
sections

The allowable bearing capacity based on shear control qa is obtained by reducing (or dividing)
the ultimate bearing capacity qu\t (based on soil strength) by a safety factor SF that is deemed
adequate to avoid a base shear failure to obtain

* - i <4-'>
The safety factor is based on the type of soil (cohesive or cohesionless), reliability of the soil
parameters, structural information (importance, use, etc.), and consultant caution. Possible
safety factors are outlined in Sec. 4-15.

4-2 BEARING CAPACITY
From Fig. 4-\a and Fig. 4-2 it is evident we have two potential failure modes, where the
footing, when loaded to produce the maximum bearing pressure qu\t, will do one or both of
the following:

a. Rotate as in Fig. 4-Ia about some center of rotation (probably along the vertical line Oa)
with shear resistance developed along the perimeter of the slip zone shown as a circle
b. Punch into the ground as the wedge agb of Fig. 4-2 or the approximate wedge ObO' of
Fig. 4-la

It should be apparent that both modes of potential failure develop the limiting soil shear
strength along the slip path according to the shear strength equation given as
s = c + (Jn tan <£ (2-52)
Although this is the equation of the Mohr's circle rupture envelope, its physical meaning
is illustrated in Fig. 4-lb as it applies along the slip lines. It is common to use total stress
parameters in this equation; however, for certain loading cases the effective stress parameters
may be more appropriate, i.e., long-term slowly applied loadings.
The problem of how to obtain a reliable value of qu\t to develop the limiting shear resistance
has been extensively covered in the literature, and several approximate methods have some
following. We will examine briefly some approximations for qu\t to illustrate the complexity

of the problem, and then in the next section look at several of the more popular bearing-
capacity methods.
For Fig. A-Ia and a 0 = 0 soil we may obtain an approximate lower-bound solution for a
unit width strip of a footing B X L (—> <») as in the following.
When the foundation pushes into the ground, stress block 1 to the left of vertical line OY
has principal stresses as shown. The push into the ground, however, displaces the soil on the
right side of the line OY laterally, resulting in the major principal stress on block 2 being
horizontal as shown. These block stresses can be shown on the Mohr's circles of Fig. 4-Ic.
When the two blocks are adjacent to each other at the vertical line OY, it is evident that
0*3,1 = °"i,2 but with a principal stress rotation of 90° between blocks. From Chap. 2

Figure 4-2 Simplified bearing capacity for a <j>-c soil.


We have for <f> = 0, tan (45 + <f)/2) = tan2 (45 + </>/2) = 1, and for block 2 at point O (corner
of footing) (732 = q = yD.1 Using these values in Eq. (2-54), we get the major principal
stress as
o"i,2 = 0-3,1 = q{\) + 2c(l) {a)
For block 1 just under the footing and again using Eq. (2-54), we have the major principal
stress <r\ti as
0-u = tfmt = <r3fi(l) + 2c(l) Q))
Substituting cr3 i from Eq. {a) into Eq. (b), we obtain
quYt = q + 2c + 2c = 4c + q (c)
This equation has two possibilities:

1. Use for bearing capacity
2. Use for critical excavation depth in clay (see Y distance of Fig. 2-10)

For bearing capacity and with the footing located on the ground surface so that aO = 0 —»
q = O of Fig. 4-Ia, we obtain the ultimate bearing pressure qu\t as
quit = 4c (d)
For a critical excavation depth, where a wall is used to support the soil along line aO and it
is necessary to estimate the depth of excavation D so that the overburden pressure does not
squeeze the soil from the toe of the wall into the excavation, we set qu\t = O and solve Eq.
(c) to obtain
<7uit = 0 = 4c + q = 4c + yD
The critical depth of excavation Dc (Safety Factor = 1) is then
D - < £
c~ r
This equation will be used later in Chap. 11.
For a possible upper-bound solution we will take a footing rotation about point O. We
observe that the rotation could be about O' as well, and for some case where the soils in the two
rotation zones were exactly equal in strength the wedge ObO' would punch into the ground. It
is statistically highly improbable, owing to worm holes, roots, or other inclusions, that rotation
will not develop first (which is substantiated by observed field failures). Summing moments
about point O, we have the peripheral shear resistance 4- overburden pressure q resisting the
footing pressure qu\t; thus,
BXB qB X B
ttiit — 2 ~ = CTTBXB- ^ - = O (e)

1ThQ q term may be either an effective or a total stress value. The reader must look at the context of usage. If there
is any doubt, use q = effective overburden pressure.


Solving for qu\u we obtain

^uIt = 2TTC + q (f)
Equation (/) gives qu\t = 6.28c when q = 0. The average from Eqs. (d) and (/) is (4c +
6.28c)/2 = 5.14c, which is, coincidentally, TT + 2 = 5.14, given by theory of plasticity. Ac-
tually, if one makes a search along and to the right of line Oa for a minimum qu\t, a value of
about 5.5c < 2TTC can be found.

Footing on a <f>-c Soil
Figure 4-2 is a possible case for the footing on a soil with both cohesion c and angle of
internal friction 0. Here a wedge failure is shown based on both theoretical considerations
and observations of model footings [see Jumikis (1962), Ko and Davidson (1973)]. When
the wedge displaces into the ground, lateral pressures are developed along line ag, which
tends to translate block ag/'horizontally against wedge afe. The pressures along vertical line
a/are shown by the stress block on the right side of that line. It can be shown using Mohr's
circles that the wedge agb develops stress slip lines, as shown on the small inset stress block,
at a = 45 H- 4>/2 with the horizontal and for a footing with a smooth base so that ab is a
principal plane. Similarly, wedge afe has slip line angles of (3 = 45 - (j>/2 that exit at line
ae (also taken as a principal plane) at an angle of /3.
From the stress block on the right of vertical line af (of length H) we can compute the
total resisting earth pressure as force Pp by integrating Eq. (2-54),
Pp=[ ax{dz)=[ f(7z + ^)tan2^45 + |j+2ctanf45 + | | j z (g)
Using the definition given in Fig. 4-2 for Kp and integrating (necessary since a\ varies from
a t o / based on depth z), we obtain

Pp = ~-'Kp + qHKp + 2cH- jK~p QI)

To find qu\t one must sum forces in the vertical direction for the half-wedge adg of unit
width using the forces shown on the figure to obtain

(*)


As we shall see in the next section, Eq. (/) underestimates qu\t substantially for several rea-
sons:

1. Zone afg is neglected.
2. The footing interface is usually rough and contributes a roughness effect.
3. The shape of block agfe poorly defines the zone resisting the wedge movement into the
soil. A logarithmic spiral better defines the slip surface from g t o / and partly along/ to e.
4. Solution is for a unit width strip across a very long footing, so it has to be adjusted for
round, square, or finite-length footings (i.e., it needs a shape factor).
5. The shear resistance from plane ae to the ground surface has been neglected, thus requiring
some kind of adjustment (i.e., a depth factor).
6. Other factors will be needed if qu\t is inclined from the vertical (i.e., inclination factors).

These derivations are only to illustrate the problems in defining the ultimate bearing ca-
pacity of a soil and are not intended for design use. Equations given in the following section
should be used for any design. For a historical perspective on bearing-capacity efforts see
Jumikis (1962), who presents a survey of a number of early proposals, which were primarily
in German.

4-3 BEARING-CAPACITY EQUATIONS
There is currently no method of obtaining the ultimate bearing capacity of a foundation other
than as an estimate. Vesic (1973) tabulated 15 theoretical solutions since 1940—and omitted
at least one of the more popular methods in current use. There have been several additional
proposals since that time.
There has been little experimental verification of any of the methods except by using model
footings. Using models of B = 25 to 75 mm X L = 25 to 200 mm is popular because the
"ultimate" load can be developed on a small prepared box of soil in the laboratory using com-
monly available compression machines on the order of 400 kN capacity. Full-size footings
as small as 1 m X 1 m can develop ultimate loads of 3000 to 4000 kN so that very expensive
site preparation and equipment availability are necessary to develop and measure loads of
this magnitude.
Models—particularly on sand—do not produce reliable test results compared to full-scale
prototypes because of scale effects. That is, the model reaction involves only a statistically
small quantity of soil grains compared with that involved with the full-scale element. For
example, sand requires confinement to develop resistance. The confined zone beneath a 25 X
50 mm model is almost nil compared with the confined zone beneath a small, say I m X
2 m, footing. It is also evident from both Fig. 1-1 and Fig. 4-2 that the depth of influence
is considerably different in the two cases. In spite of this major defect in testing, the use of
models is widespread and the literature regularly reports on the results of a new test program.
Centrifuge testing is used by some laboratories that can afford the expensive equipment.
In this type of test the model footing is placed on a simulation of the foundation soil and spun
in a centrifuge. Almost any practical multiple (or fraction) of the gravitational force can be
modeled by adjusting the spin rate of the centrifuge. For a number of practical reasons—
primarily soil simulation—this test has not received a wide following.


The Terzaghi Bearing-Capacity Equation
One of the early sets of bearing-capacity equations was proposed by Terzaghi (1943) as
shown in Table 4-1. These equations are similar to Eq. (k) derived in the previous section,
but Terzaghi used shape factors noted when the limitations of the equation were discussed.
Terzaghi's equations were produced from a slightly modified bearing-capacity theory devel-

oped by Prandtl (ca. 1920) from using the theory of plasticity to analyze the punching of
a rigid base into a softer (soil) material. Similar to Eq. (Jk), the basic equation was for the
case in which a unit width from a long strip produced a plane strain case, all shape factors
St = 1.00, but the Af; factors were computed differently. Terzaghi used a = <f> in Figs. 4-2
and 4-3 whereas most other theories use the a = 45 4- </>/2 shown. We see in Table 4-1 that
Terzaghi only used shape factors with the cohesion (sc) and base (sy) terms. The Terzaghi
bearing-capacity equation is developed, as was Eq. (£), by summing vertical forces on the
wedge bac of Fig. 4-3. The difference in TV factors results from the assumption of the log
spiral arc ad and exit wedge cde of Fig 4-3. This makes a very substantial difference in how
Pp is computed, which in turn gives the different Ni values. The shear slip lines shown on
Fig. 4-3 qualitatively illustrate stress trajectories in the plastic zone beneath the footing as
the ultimate bearing pressure is developed.
Terzaghi's bearing-capacity equations were intended for "shallow" foundations where

so that the shear resistance along cd of Fig. A-3a could be neglected. Table 4-1 lists the
Terzaghi equation and the method for computing the several N1- factors and the two shape
factors si. Table 4-2 is a short table of TV factors produced from a computer program and
edited for illustration and for rapid use by the reader. Terzaghi never explained very well
how he obtained the KP7 used to compute the bearing-capacity factor N7 . He did, however,
give a small-scale curve of <fi versus N7 and three specific values of N7 at cf) = 0, 34, and
48° as shown on Table 4-2. The author took additional points from this curve and used a
computer to back-compute KP7 to obtain a table of best-fit values from which the tabulated
values of N7 shown in Table 4-2 could be computed from the equation for N7 shown in Table
4-1. Inspection of Table 4-4 indicates that the Meyerhof N7^M) values are fairly close except
for angles of (/> > 40°. Other approximations for N7 include the following:
N7 = 2(Nq + l)tan<£ Vesic (1973)
N7 = 1.1(A^ - 1) tan 1.30 Spangler and Handy (1982)
The N7 value has the widest suggested range of values of any of the bearing-capacity N
factors. A literature search reveals
38 < N7 < 192 for</> - 40°
In this textbook values from Tables 4-2 and 4-4 give a range from about 79 to 109.
Recently Kumbhojkar (1993) presented a series of values of N7 with the claim they are
better representations of the Terzaghi values than those of Table 4-2. An inspection of these

Fortunately the Ny term does not make a significant contribution to the computed bearing
capacity, so any of the values from Tables 4-2 or 4-4 can be used (or perhaps an average).
Bolton and Lau (1993) produced new Nq and N7 values for strip and circular footings
for both smooth and rough ground interfacings. Their Nq values for either smooth or rough
strips are little different from the Hansen values for rough strips. The Nq values for circular
footings range to more than two times the strip values. The N7 values for rough footings
compare well with the Vesic values in Table 4-4. Since the Table 4-4 values have shape s,-
and depth di factors to be applied, it appears that these "new" values offer little advantage
and are certainly more difficult to compute (see comparison with Terzaghi values in preceding
table).

Meyerhof 's Bearing-Capacity Equation
Meyerhof (1951, 1963) proposed a bearing-capacity equation similar to that of Terzaghi
but included a shape factor sq with the depth term Nq. He also included depth factors d,- and

inclination factors i,- [both noted in discussion of Eq. (/)] for cases where the footing load is
inclined from the vertical. These additions produce equations of the general form shown in
Table 4-1, with select TV factors computed in Table 4-4. Program BEARING is provided on
disk for other Af; values.
Meyerhof obtained his N factors by making trials of the zone abd' with arc ad' of Fig.
4-3£, which include an approximation for shear along line cd of Fig. 4-3a. The shape, depth,
and inclination factors in Table 4-3 are from Meyerhof (1963) and are somewhat different
from his 1951 values. The shape factors do not greatly differ from those given by Terzaghi
except for the addition of sq. Observing that the shear effect along line cd of Fig. 4-3a was
still being somewhat ignored, Meyerhof proposed depth factors d(.
He also proposed using the inclination factors of Table 4-3 to reduce the bearing capacity
when the load resultant was inclined from the vertical by the angle 6. When the iy factor is
used, it should be self-evident that it does not apply when 0 = 0°, since a base slip would
occur with this term—even if there is base cohesion for the ic term. Also, the i/ factors all =
1.0 if the angle d = 0.
Up to a depth of D « B in Fig. 4-3a, the Meyerhof qu\t is not greatly different from the
Terzaghi value. The difference becomes more pronounced at larger D/B ratios.

Hansen's Bearing-Capacity Method
Hansen (1970) proposed the general bearing-capacity case and N factor equations shown
in Table 4-1. This equation is readily seen to be a further extension of the earlier Meyer-
hof (1951) work. Hansen's shape, depth, and other factors making up the general bearing-
capacity equation are given in Table 4-5. These represent revisions and extensions from ear-
lier proposals in 1957 and 1961. The extensions include base factors for situations in which
the footing is tilted from the horizontal bt and for the possibility of a slope /3 of the ground
supporting the footing to give ground factors g;. Table 4-4 gives selected TV values for the
Hansen equations together with computation aids for the more difficult shape and depth fac-
tor terms. Use program BEARING for intermediate Nj factors, because interpolation is not
recommended, especially for <f> ^ 35°.
Any of the equations given in Table 4-5 not subscripted with a V may be used as appropriate
(limitations and restrictions are noted in the table). The equations shown in this table for
inclination factors I1- will be considered in additional detail in Sec. 4-6.
Note that when the base is tilted, V and H are perpendicular and parallel, respectively, to
the base, compared with when it is horizontal as shown in the sketch with Table 4-5.
For a footing on a slope both the Hansen and Vesic gt factors can be used to reduce (or
increase, depending on the direction of Hf) the bearing capacity using N factors as given in
Table 4-4. Section 4-9 considers an alternative method for obtaining the bearing capacity of
footings on a slope.
The Hansen equation implicitly allows any D/B and thus can be used for both shallow
(footings) and deep (piles, drilled caissons) bases. Inspection of the qNq term suggests a
great increase in qu\t with great depth. To place modest limits on this, Hansen used


These expressions give a discontinuity at D/B = 1; however, note the use of < and >. For
(f) = 0 (giving J^.) we have

D/B = 0 1 1.5* 2 5 10 20 100
</; = 0 0.40 0.42 0.44 0.55 0.59 0.61 0.62
•Actually computes 0.39

We can see that use of tan"1 D/B for D/B > 1 controls the increase in dc and dq that are in
line with observations that qu\t appears to approach a limiting value at some depth ratio D/B,
where this value of D is often termed the critical depth. This limitation on qu\t will be further
considered in Chap. 16 on piles.

Vesic's Bearing-Capacity Equations
The Vesic (1973, 1915b) procedure is essentially the same as the method of Hansen (1961)
with select changes. The Nc and Nq terms are those of Hansen but N7 is slightly different
(see Table 4-4). There are also differences in the //, Z?;, and gi terms as in Table 4-5c. The
Vesic equation is somewhat easier to use than Hansen's because Hansen uses the / terms in
computing shape factors si whereas Vesic does not (refer to Examples 4-6 and 4-7 following).

Which Equations to Use
There are few full-scale footing tests reported in the literature (where one usually goes to
find substantiating data). The reason is that, as previously noted, they are very expensive
to do and the cost is difficult to justify except as pure research (using a government grant)
or for a precise determination for an important project—usually on the basis of settlement
control. Few clients are willing to underwrite the costs of a full-scale footing load test when
the bearing capacity can be obtained—often using empirical SPT or CPT data directly—to a
sufficient precision for most projects.
Table 4-6 is a summary of eight load tests where the footings are somewhat larger than
models and the soil data are determined as accurately as possible. The soil parameters and
qu\t (in kg/cm2) are from MiIovie (1965). The several methods used in this text [and the Balla
(1961) method used in the first edition, which is a subroutine in supplemental computer pro-
gram B-31 noted on your diskette] have been recomputed using plane strain adjustments
where L/B > 1. Comparing the computed qu\t to the measured values indicates none of the
several theories/methods has a significant advantage over any other in terms of a best predic-
tion. The use of $p s instead of </>tr when L/B > 1 did improve the computed qu\t for all except
the Balla method.
Since the soil wedge beneath round and square bases is much closer to a triaxial than plane
strain state, the adjustment of cf)iT to cf>ps is recommended only when L/B > 2.

For:


The Terzaghi equations, being the first proposed, have been very widely used. Because of
their greater ease of use (one does not need to compute all the extra shape, depth, and other
factors) they are still used—probably more than they should be. They are only suitable for
a concentrically loaded footing on horizontal ground. They are not applicable for footings
carrying a horizontal shear and/or a moment or for tilted bases (see Example 4-7 following).
Both the Meyerhof and Hansen methods are widely used. The Vesic method has not been
much used [but is the suggested procedure in the API RP2A (1984) manual]. As previously
noted there is very little difference between the Hansen and Vesic methods, as illustrated by
the computed qu\t values shown in Table 4-6 (see also Example 4-7).
From these observations one may suggest the following equation use:

Use Best for

Terzaghi Very cohesive soils where D/B < 1 or for a quick
estimate of quit to compare with other methods. Do
not use for footings with moments and/or horizontal
forces or for tilted bases and/or sloping ground.
Hansen, Meyerhof, Vesic Any situation that applies, depending on user
preference or familiarity with a particular method.
Hansen, Vesic When base is tilted; when footing is on a slope or
when D/B > 1.

It is good practice to use at least two methods and compare the computed values of qu\t. If
the two values do not compare well, use a third method, a trivial exercise where the equations
have been programmed for computer use. Use either an arithmetic or weighted average2 value
for the qa provided for design (unless settlement is controlling).

4-4 ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS WHEN USING
THE BEARING-CAPACITY EQUATIONS
One should avoid using tables of Af factors that require interpolation over about 2°. It is a
trivial exercise to program the equations (or use program BEARING) to obtain N values
for any angle. For angles larger than 35° the factors change rapidly and by large amounts.
Interpolation can have a sizable error (or difference), so someone checking the work may not
be able to verify qu\t.
The methods used to develop the bearing-capacity equations do not satisfy moment equi-
librium but do satisfy X FH = X Fy = 0. This error is not serious since statics is obviously

2Weighting is as follows: If you have values of 2 and 4 but believe 2 is 1.5 times as good as the 4, a weighted
average gives
2(1.5) + 4 _ 7
W " 1 + 1.5 ~ 15 " 1 8
An arithmetic average is simply (2 + 4)/2 = 3.

satisfied at ultimate loading but, of course, the interaction model may not be the same. The
soil stress state is indeterminate at the design stress level qa, similar to the stress state in a
triaxial (or other) shear test. It is only at failure (quu) that the stress state is determined.
The bearing-capacity equations tend to be conservative most of the time, because the com-
mon practice is to use conservative estimates for the soil parameters. Additionally, after ob-
taining a conservative qu\t this is further reduced to the allowable soil pressure qa using a
safety factor. This means the probability is very high that qa is "safe."
When Terzaghi (1943) developed his bearing-capacity equations, he considered a general
shear failure in a dense soil and a local shear failure for a loose soil. For the local shear failure
he proposed reducing the cohesion and 4> as
c" = 0.67c
</>" = tan"l (0.67 tan <f>)
Terzaghi (and others) consider both smooth and rough base contact with the soil. It is doubtful
that one would place a footing on a loose soil, and concrete footings poured directly on the
soil will always be rough. Even metal storage tanks are not smooth, since the base is always
treated with paint or an asphalt seal to resist corrosion.
There is some evidence, from using small footings up to about 1 m for B, that the BN7
term does not increase the bearing capacity without bound, and for very large values of B
both Vesic (1969) and De Beer (1965) suggest that the limiting value of qu\t approaches that
of a deep foundation. The author suggests the following reduction factor:
/B\
ry = 1 -0.25log - B > 2m (6ft)
\ K /
where K = 2.0 for SI and 6.0 for fps. This equation gives the following results:

B = 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 5 10 20 100 m
ry = 1.0 0.97 0.95 0.93 0.92 0.90 0.82 0.75 0.57

One can use this reduction factor with any of the bearing-capacity methods to give
0.5yBNySydyry
This equation is particularly applicable for large bases at small D/B ratios where the BNy
term is predominating.
General observations about the bearing-capacity equations may be made as follows:

1. The cohesion term predominates in cohesive soil.
2. The depth term (qNq) predominates in cohesionless soils. Only a small D increases qu\t
substantially.
3. The base width term 0.5yBNy provides some increase in bearing capacity for both cohe-
sive and cohesionless soils. In cases where B < 3 to 4 m this term could be neglected with
little error.
4. No one would place a footing on the surface of a cohesionless soil mass.


5. It is highly unlikely that one would place a footing on a cohesionless soil with a Dr (Table
3-4) less than 0.5. If the soil is loose, it would be compacted in some manner to a higher
density prior to placing footings in it.
6. Where the soil beneath the footing is not homogeneous or is stratified, some judgment must
be applied to determine the bearing capacity. In the case of stratification, later sections will
consider several cases.
7. When a base must be designed for a particular load, except for the Terzaghi method, one
must use an iterative procedure since the shape, depth, and inclination factors depend on
B. A computer program such as B-31 is most useful for this type problem. It should be set
to increment the base by 0.010-m or 0.25-ft (3-in.) steps as this is a common multiple of
base dimensions.
8. Inspection of Table 4-1 indicates that the Terzaghi equation is much easier to use than the
other methods (see also Example 4-1) so that it has great appeal for many practitioners,
particularly for bases with only vertical loads and D/B < 1. Its form is also widely used
for deep foundations but with adjusted N factors.
9. Vesic (1973) recommends that depth factors dt not be used for shallow foundations (D/B <
1) because of uncertainties in quality of the overburden. However, he did give the values
shown in Table 4-5 despite this recommendation.

4-5 BEARING-CAPACITY EXAMPLES
The following examples illustrate the application of the bearing-capacity equations to some
typical problems.

Example 4-1. Compute the allowable bearing pressure using the Terzaghi equation for the footing
and soil parameters shown in Fig. E4-1. Use a safety factor of 3 to obtain qa. Compare this with the
value obtained from using Eq. (/). The soil data are obtained from a series of undrained U triaxial
tests. Is the soil saturated?

Figure E4-1

Solution.

1. The soil is not saturated, since a U test gives a <j> angle. A CU test might give similar data for a
saturated soil.
2. Find the bearing capacity. Note that this value is usually what a geotechnical consultant would
have to recommend (B not known but D is). From Table 4-2 obtain

Since 5 is likely to range from 1.5 to 3 m and at 3 m ry = 0.95,
qa = 205 + 11.5(1.5) = 22OkPa (rounding)
qa = 205 + 11.5(3)(0.95) = 24OkPa

qa = 60 + 4.3B (SF = 3)
For a reasonable size footing Eq.(/) gives qa = 60 kPa. For this soil with cf> = 30°, B = 1.5 m,
and SF = 3.0, we get

qa = 100+135 = 110 kPa
We can see Eq. (/) is so conservative as to be nearly useless.

Example 4-2. A footing load test made by H. Muhs in Berlin [reported by Hansen (1970)] produced
the following data:


D = 0.5 m B = 0.5 m L = 2.0 m
y' = 9.31 kN/m3 ^w1 3 I = 42.7° Cohesion c = 0
Pu h = 1863 kN (measured) #ult = ^ = * 8 6 3 = 1863 kPa (computed)
£>L 0.5 X 2

Required. Compute the ultimate bearing capacity by both Hansen and Meyerhof equations and
compare these values with the measured value.

Solution.

a. Since c = 0, any factors with subscript c do not need computing. All gt and bt factors are 1.00;
with these factors identified, the Hansen equation simplifies to

#ult = y'DNqSqdq + Q.5j 'BN7S7 dy
LIB = ^ = 4 -> ^p8 = 1.5(42.5) - 17 = 46.75°
Use <£ = 47°
From a table of <f> in 1° increments (table not shown) obtain
^ = 187 N7 = 299
Using linear interpolation of Table 4-4 gives 208.2 and 347.2. Using Table A-5a one obtains [get
the 2 tan 0(1 — sin </>)2 part of dq term from Table 4-4] the following:

sq(H) = 1 + — sin^ = 1.18 s7(H) = 1 - 0.4— = 0.9

dq = 1+ 2tan0(l - sin</>)2^ = 1 + 0 . 1 5 5 ^
D D
= 1+0.155(^1)= 1.155 d7 = 1.0
With these values we obtain
qult = 9.31(0.5)(187)(1.18)(1.155) + 0.5(9.31)(0.5)(299)(0.9)(l)
= 1812 kPa vs. 1863 kPa measured

b. By the Meyerhof equations of Table 4-1 and 4-3, and <£ps = 47°, we can proceed as follows:
Stepl. Obtain A^ = 187


Step 2. Substitute into the Meyerhof equation (ignoring any c subscripts):

quit = y'DNqsqdq + 0.5yBNySydy
= 9.31(0.5)(187)(l. 16)(1.25) + 0.5(9.31)(0.5)(414)(1.16)(1.25)
= 1262+ 1397 = 2659 kPa

Example 4-3. A series of large-scale footing bearing-capacity tests were performed on soft
Bangkok clay [Brand et al. (1972)]. One of the tests consisted of a 1.05-m-square footing at a
depth D = 1.5 m. At a 1-in. settlement the load was approximately 14.1 tons from interpretation
of the given load-settlement curve. Unconfined compression and vane shear tests gave U strength
values as follows:
qu = 3.0 ton/m2 su = 3.0 ton/m2 su, vane = 2.4 ton/m2
These data were obtained by the author's interpretation of data presented in several plots and in the
zone from 1 to 2 m below footing. Plasticity data were WL = 80 and wp = 35 percent. The units
of this problem are those of the test as reported in the cited source. These and other load-settlement
data are in Prob. 4-17.

Required. Compute the ultimate bearing capacity by the Hansen equations and compare with the
load-test value of 14.1 tons.

Solution. Obtain N, s't, and d\ factors. Since <fi = 0° for a U test, we have Nc = 5.14 and Nq = 1.0.
From Fig. 3-26« and Ip = 45, obtain a reduction factor of 0.8 (there are not enough data to use Fig.
3-266).
sM,des = AsM!vane = 0.8(2.4) = 1.92 ton/m2
s'c = o.2j = 0.2 j = 0.2

d'c = 0.4Ian-1 % = 0.4 tan"1 -^- = 0.38 (D > B)
B 1.05
Neglect qNq, since there was probably operating space in the footing excavation. Thus,

tfuit = 5.14J11(I + s'c + d'c) Table 4-1 for <j> = 0 case
qult = 5.14(1.92)(1 + 0.2 + 0.38) = 15.6 ton/m2
From load test, Actual = n s 2 = 12.8 ton/m2
If we use the unconfined compression tests and take su = qu/2, we obtain

4uit = p ^ ( 1 5 - 6 ) = 12.2 ton/m2

////

Example 4-4.

Given. A series of unconfined compression tests in the zone of interest (from SPT samples) from a
boring-log give an average qu = 200 kPa.


Required. Estimate the allowable bearing capacity for square footings located at somewhat uncer-
tain depths and B dimensions unknown using both the Meyerhof and Terzaghi bearing-capacity
equations. Use safety factor SF = 3.0.

Solution. (The reader should note this is the most common procedure for obtaining the allowable
bearing capacity for cohesive soils with limited data.)

a. By Meyerhof equations,

c = %• (for both equations) s

c = 1.2

qult = 1.2cTVc + qNq
qa=«f = 1.2^(5.14)1 + I = 1.03^ + 0.3?
b. By Terzaghi equations, we can take sc = 1.3 for <f> = 0.
qa = ^f = f (5.7)(1.3)i + § = 1.24^+0.35
It is common to neglect 0.3g and note that either 1.03 or 1.24 is sufficiently close to 1.0 (and is
conservative) to take the allowable bearing pressure as
qa = qu = 200 kPa

The use of qa = qu for the allowable bearing capacity is nearly universal when SPT samples are
used for qu. Since these samples are in a very disturbed state, the true SF may well be on the order
of 4 or 5 instead of close to 3.0 as used above. This method of obtaining qa is not recommended
when qu is less than about 75 kPa or 1.5 ksf. In these cases su should be determined on samples of
better quality than those from an SPT.

HSCUSSION OF EXAMPLES. Examples 4-1 and 4-4 illustrate the simplicity of the Terza-
ghi bearing-capacity method. They also illustrate that the approximate Eq. (/) is much too
conservative for use in design.
Examples 4-2 and 4-3 illustrate how to use the equations and how to check load test values.
Example 4-4 also illustrates the common practice of using the simple version of
tfuit = cNc = 3qu; qa = qu
s[ote that for a "deep" foundation (say D/B = 15) in a cohesive soil su = c for either a round
>r square base, and using the Hansen or Vesic equations, we have

d'c = O^tan"1 ^ = 0.4(1.47) - 0.59
4 = 0.2(f)=0.2
ind for the equation in Table 4-1 for 0 = 0 we have


The value of qu\t = 9c is used worldwide with local values (from load tests) ranging from
about 7.5 to 11. The Terzaghi equation gives 7.41c but Meyerhof's method is not valid since
it gives a value of 25 c.

4-6 FOOTINGS WITH ECCENTRIC
OR INCLINED LOADINGS
A footing may be eccentrically loaded from a concentric column with an axial load and mo-
ments about one or both axes as in Fig. 4-4. The eccentricity may result also from a column
that is initially not centrally located or becomes off-center when a part of the footing is cut
away during remodeling and/or installing new equipment. Obviously the footing cannot be
cut if an analysis indicates the recomputed soil pressure might result in a bearing failure.

Footings with Eccentricity
Research and observation [Meyerhof (1953,1963) and Hansen (1970)] indicate that effective
footing dimensions obtained (refer to Fig. 4-4) as
L' = L-Iex B' = B- 2ey
should be used in bearing-capacity analyses to obtain an effective footing area defined as
Af = B'L'
and the center of pressure when using a rectangular pressure distribution of q' is the center
of area BL' at point A'\ i.e., from Fig A-Aa:
Iex + L' = L
ex + c = LlI
Substitute for L and obtain c = L'fl. If there is no eccentricity about either axis, use the
actual footing dimension for that B' or L'.
The effective area of a round base can be computed by locating the eccentricity ex on any
axis by swinging arcs with centers shown to produce an area abed, which is then reduced
to an equivalent rectangular base of dimensions B' X U as shown on Fig. A-Ab. You should
locate the dimension B' so that the left edge (line c'd') is at least at the left face of the column
located at point O.
For design (considered in Chap. 8) the minimum dimensions (to satisfy ACI 318-) of a
rectangular footing with a central column of dimensions wx X wy are required to be
#min = ^Zy + Wy B' = 2ey + Wy
Lmin = 4ex + Wx L' = Iex + Wx
Final dimensions may be larger than Bm[n or Lm{n based on obtaining the required allowable
bearing capacity.
The ultimate bearing capacity for footings with eccentricity, using either the Meyerhof or
Hansen/Vesic equations, is found in either of two ways:

Method 1. Use either the Hansen or Vesic bearing-capacity equation given in Table 4-1 with
the following adjustments:


(b) Round base
Figure 4-4 Method of computing effective footing dimensions when footing is eccentrically loaded for both
rectangular and round bases.
a. Use B' in the yBNy term.
b. Use B' and L' in computing the shape factors.
c. Use actual B and L for all depth factors.

The computed ultimate bearing capacity qu\t is then reduced to an allowable value qa with
an appropriate safety factor SF as
qa = W S F (and Pa = qaB'L')
Method 2. Use the Meyerhof general bearing-capacity equation given in Table 4-1 and a
reduction factor Re used as
^uIt, des — ^uIt, comp * Re
Since Meyerhof (1953) suggested this method, it should be used only with the Meyerhof
equation to compute the bearing capacity. The original Meyerhof method gave reduction
curves; however, the following equations are suitable for obtaining the reduction factor:
Re = 1 - 2e/B (cohesive soil)
Re = 1 - Je/B (cohesionless soil and for 0 < e/B < 0.3)
It should be evident from Fig. 4-4 that if e/B = 0.5, the point A' falls at the edge of the base
and an unstable foundation results. In practice the e/B ratio is seldom greater than 0.2 and is

(a) Rectangular base

using


usually limited to e < B/6. In these reduction factor equations the dimensions B and L are
referenced to the axis about which the base moment occurs. Normally, greatest base efficiency
is obtained by using the larger or length dimension L to resist overturning. For round bases
use B as the diameter, and for octagonal shapes use B as the effective base diameter.
Alternatively, one may directly use the Meyerhof equation with B' and Il used to compute
the shape and depth factors and Br used in the 0.5yB'Ny term. This method is preferred by
the author.

Example 4-5. A square footing is 1.8 X 1.8 m with a 0.4 X 0.4 m square column. It is loaded with
an axial load of 1800 kN and Mx = 450 kN • m; My = 360 kN • m. Undrained triaxial tests (soil
not saturated) give <f> = 36° and c = 20 kPa. The footing depth D = 1.8 m; the soil unit weight
y = 18.00 kN/m3; the water table is at a depth of 6.1 m from the ground surface.

Required. What is the allowable soil pressure, if SF = 3.0, using the Hansen bearing-capacity
equation with B', L'\ Meyerhof's equation; and the reduction factor Rel

Solution. See Fig. E4-5.
ey = 450/1800 = 0.25 m ex = 360/1800 = 0.20 m
Both values of e are < B/6 = 1.8/6 = 0.30 m. Also

#min = 4(0.25) + 0.4 = 1.4 < 1.8 m given
Lmin = 4(0.20) + 0.4 = 1.2 < 1.8 m given

Now find

B' = B - 2ey = 1.8 - 2(0.25) = 1.3 m (B' < L)
L' = L-Iex = 1.8 - 2(0.20) = 1.4 m (L' > B')
By Hansen's equation. From Table 4-4 at </> = 36° and rounding to integers, we obtain

Nc = 51 Nq = 38 Ny = 40
NJNc = 0.746 2tan<Kl - sin<£)2 = 0.247
Compute D/B = 1.8/1.8 = 1.0

Now compute

5c = 1 + (Nq/NC)(B'/U) = 1 + 0.746(1.3/1.4) = 1.69
dc = 1 + 0AD/B = 1 + 0.4(1.8/1.8) = 1.40
sq = 1+ (£'/L')sin</> = 1 + (1.3/1.4) sin 36° = 1.55
dq = 1 + 2tan<£(l - sin<t>)2D/B = 1 + 0.247(1.0) = 1.25
sy = 1 - 0 . 4 ^ = 1 - 0 . 4 ^ = 0.62 > 0.60 (O.K.)
dy = LO
All/, = gi = bt = 1.0 (not 0.0)
The Hansen equation is given in Table 4-1 as


Figure E4-5

Inserting values computed above with terms of value 1.0 not shown (except dy) and using B' = 1.3,
we obtain

to = 20(51)(1.69)(1.4) + 1.8(18.0)(38)(1.55)(1.25)
+ 0.5(18.0)(1.3)(40)(0.62)(1.0)
= 2413 + 2385 + 290 = 5088 kPa
For SF = 3.0 the allowable soil pressure qa is

Usually backfilled


The actual soil pressure is

1800 1800 O O O , D
*"*= fi^=L3^T4=989kPa
Note that the allowable pressure qa is very large, and the actual soil pressure gact is also large. With
this large actual soil pressure, settlement may be the limiting factor. Some geotechnical consultants
routinely limit the maximum allowable soil pressure to around 500 kPa in recommendations to
clients for design whether settlement is a factor or not. Small footings with large column loads are
visually not very confidence-inspiring during construction, and with such a large load involved this
is certainly not the location to be excessively conservative.
By Meyerhof 's method and Re. This method uses actual base dimensions B X L:
Kp = tan2 (45 + </>/2) = tan2 (45 + 36/2) = 3.85
J^P = 1.96
From Table 4-3,
Nc = 51 Nq = 38 (same as Hansen values) Ny = 44.4 -» 44
Also

dq = dy = 1 +0.1(1.96)(1.0) = 1.20
Now direct substitution into the Meyerhof equation of Table 4-1 for the vertical load case gives
tfuit = 20(5I)(1.77)(1.39) + 1.8(18.0)(38)(1.39)(1.20)
+ 0.5(18.0)(1.8)(44)(1.39)(1.20)
= 2510 + 2054 + 1189 = 5752 kPa
There will be two reduction factors since there is two-way eccentricity. Use the equation for cohe-
sionless soils since the cohesion is small (only 20 kPa):

(P \0.5 ,
ReB = l - (!2 = l - Vo.25/1.8 = 1 - 0.37 = 0.63
ie \0-5 /
ReL = 1 " m = 1 " Vo.2/1.8 = 0.67
\ LJ I
The reduced quli = 5152(ReBReL) = 5752(0.63 X 0.67) = 2428 kPa. The allowable (SF = 3)
soil pressure = 2428/3 = 809 -* 810 kPa. The actual soil pressure = 1800/(BL) = 1800/(1.8 X
1.8) = 555 kPa.
Meyerhof's reduction factors were based on using small model footings (B on the order of 50
mm), but a series of tests using a 0.5 X 2 m concrete base, reported by Muhs and Weiss (1969),
indicated that the Meyerhof reduction method is not unreasonable.

Comments, The Hansen method gives high soil pressures but indicates the base is satisfactory.
The Meyerhof method also indicates the base is satisfactory but with a very different qa. Now the


question is, what does one do? The author would most probably limit the soil pressure to qa = 500
kPa (which is less than either Meyerhof or Hansen) and back-compute a base as follows:
NewB'L' = 1800/500 = 3.6 m2
Original ratio of B'/L' = 1.3/1.4 = 0.929
0.929L'2 = 3.6-* L' = 1.97 m then B' = 1.83 m
From these find
B = 1.83 + 2(0.25) = 2.33 and L = 1.97 + 2(0.2) = 2.37
Thus, make the base square with dimensions 2.40 X 2.40 m.

Footings with Inclined Loads
Inclined loads are produced when the footing is loaded with both a vertical V and a horizontal
component(s) Hi of loading (refer to Table 4-5 and its figure). This loading is common for
many industrial process footings where horizontal wind loads are in combination with the
gravity loads. The retaining wall base design of Chap. 12 is a classic case of a foundation
with both a horizontal (the lateral earth pressure) and vertical loading. Eccentricity results
from the vertical load not being initially located at BfI and from the lateral earth pressure
effects.
Rolling equipment (as in steel mills) and a number of other types of industrial founda-
tions are subjected to horizontal loads from material going through the equipment mounted
on the foundation or from pulls or pushes applied to the foundation from servicing, re-
pair/replacement, or normal operations. In any case the load inclination results in a bearing-
capacity reduction over that of a foundation subjected to a vertical load only.
The inclination factors of Tables 4-3 and 4-5 can be used with the Meyerhof, Hansen,
or Vesic bearing-capacity equations. The Terzaghi equations have no direct provision for a
reduction in cases where the load is inclined.
The Meyerhof inclination factors //M are reasonably self-explanatory. The Hansen values
are shown with the exponent of a\ for iq and a: 2 for iy. The a\ terms are used because Hansen
(1970) gives a \ = 5, however. In the late 1950s Hansen had suggested using the exponent of
2 for iq and iy = (iq)2. In the interim Vesic had concluded that the exponent should depend
somewhat on the L/B (or B/L) ratio, giving the m exponents in Table 4-5c, with a lower
limiting value of m = 2 and an upper limit not much larger than 2. The Vesic values were
based in part on published exponents ranging from 2 < ic < 5 to 3 < iq = iy < 5.
The author suggests that the Hansen (1970) exponents of 5 are too large (using as a guide
both the Vesic and the earlier Hansen values). Instead, the following less conservative expo-
nents should be used in the Hansen equations:
For iq use exponent = 2 to 3
For iy use exponent = 3 to 4
Using the Inclination Factors
In the general case of inclined loading there is a horizontal component parallel to each base
dimension defined as
H = HB parallel to the B dimension


For HB = 0.0; iCfB, iq,B, iy,B are all 1.0
H = Hi parallel to the L dimension
For HL = 0.0; iC)L, iq>L, iy>L are all 1.0
These Hi values are used to compute inclination factors for the Hansen equation as follows.

1. Compute the inclination factors using the equations given in Table 4-5 and using either
the exponent given in that table or the one suggested in the previous paragraph.
2. Use the inclination factors just computed to compute Hansen shape factors as
s'cB = 0.2Bic>B/L s'cL = 0.2LicjB (0 = 0 case)
Sc-B = h0 + IT

Limitation: syj > 0.6 (if less than 0.6 use 0.60)

These are used in the following modifications of the "edited" Hansen bearing capacity equa-

Use the smaller value of qu\t computed by either of Eqs. (4-2).
The Vesic equation for bearing capacity with inclined loads takes into account the load
direction (HB, HL) in computing the m exponents for the inclination factors U of Table 4-5.
The i factors are not used in computing the s factors, and Vesic always used the least "actual"
lateral dimension as B' in the N7 term of the general bearing-capacity equation.

Passive Earth Pressure and Bearing Capacity
With a horizontal load component a base must be stable against both sliding and bearing
capacity. For sliding, the general equation can be written using partial safety factors SF/
(usually SF, = SF) as
V\IUL8+ CgB'U Pp (A
HB or L = ^ + ^FT (4-3)
where all terms except Pp are defined in Table 4-5 or on its figure. The passive pressure Pp
is defined in Chap. 11. If the passive pressure term is included, the user must decide whether

Remember that all dy = 1.0.


the full depth from ground surface to base of footing Df can be relied upon or if only the
base depth (footing thickness) Dc should be used to resist sliding. If you elect to use the
passive pressure as a component of sliding resistance, the base must be in intimate contact
with the soil around the base perimeter. Also, if you use the passive pressure in this manner,
you should compute the bearing capacity based on all d{ = 1.0 (all depth factors = 1.0).

+ 0.5(9.43)(2.0)(300)(0.60)(1.0)(0.361)
= 1549.9 + 612.76 = 2162.7 -> 215OkPa
Using the smaller computed value, we find the Hansen method seems to give qu\t = 1700 kPa »
106OkPa of load test.
(b) Vesic's method.


Substitute into the following equation (cohesion term = 0.0 and is not shown):
<7uit = qNqsqdqiq + \y'B'NySydyiy
= 0.5(9.43)(187)(1.27)(l. 16)(0.585) + 0.5(9.43)(0.5)(404)(0.9)(l)(0.374)
= 759.9 + 320.6 = 1080.5 -> 1080 kPa
This result compares with the load test pressure qu\t = 1060 ( = V) kPa. Refer also to Probs. 4-6
and 4-7.
You should hot conclude from this example that either the Hansen or Vesic equation is better to
use. For one thing, a 1° change in ^ will change both results significantly. For important projects
one should compute the bearing capacity by at least two methods to verify your result and to make
a design recommendation for the allowable soil pressure qa — guit/SF. In many cases the allowable
soil pressure is based on settlement considerations rather than on #uit/SF.

Example 4-7.

Given. A 2 X 2 m square footing has the ground slope of /3 = 0 for the given direction of H8, but
we would use /3 « —80° (could use —90°) if HB were reversed along with passive pressure Pp to
resist sliding and base geometry shown in Fig. E4-7.

Figure E4-7

Required. Are the footing dimensions adequate for the given loads if we use a safety (or stability)
factor SF = 3?

Solution. We may use any of Hansen's, Meyerhof 's, or Vesic's equations.
Hansen's method. Initially let us use Hansen's equations (to illustrate further the interrelationship
between the U and Sj factors).
Assumptions: 8 = <f> ca = c D = 0.3 m (smallest value)


First check sliding safety (and neglect the passive pressure Pp for D = 0.3 m on right side)
^max = AfCa + V tan 0 = (4)(25) + 600 tan 25 = 379.8 kN
Sliding stability (or SF) = FmjH = 379.8/200 = 1.90 (probably O.K.)
From Table 4-4 (or computer program) obtain the Hansen bearing capacity and other factors (for
0 = 25°) as
Nc = 20.7 Nq = 10.7 N7 = 6.8 Nq/Nc = 0.514
2 tan 0(1 -sine/))2 = 0.311
Compute D/B = DlB' = D/L = 0.3/2 = 0.15.
Next compute depth factors d[\
dy = 1.00
dc = 1 + 0AD/B = 1 + 0.4(0.3/2) = 1.06
dq = 1 + 2tan0(1 ~ sin0)2(D/£) = 1 + 0.311(0.15) = 1.046-» 1.05
Compute the inclination factors Z1- so we can compute the shape factors:

V + AfCa cot 0 = 600 + (2 X 2)(25)tan25 = 600 + 214.4 = 814.4

We will use exponents a\ = 3 and « 2 = 4 (instead of 5 for both—see text):
1 ~ V 
+ A,ca

Bc«<,\ = n - 0 . 5 ( 2 0 0 ) / 8 1 4 . 4 ] 3 = 0.675
^- ^ f1 - ( V 7 : : / 4 5 0 ° t ? 1 4 = ^1 - <°-7 - 10/450)(200)/S14.4]^
L V + ^ / c a COt0 J
= [1 - 0.68(200)/814.4]4 = 0.481
iytL = 1.00 (since HL = 0.0)
We can now compute iCtB as
^B = ig ~ lrz\ = °-675 - (! " 0.675)/(10.7 - 1) = 0.641
Using the just-computed / factors, we can compute shape factors Si1B as follows. With Hi ~ 0.0 and
a square base it is really not necessary to use double subscripts for the several shape and inclination
factors, but we will do it here to improve clarity:
ScB = 1 + ^ • 

3 ^ = l + 0.514[2(0.641)]/2 - 1.329

sq>B = 1 + s i n 0 ( ^ - ^ ] = 1 + sin25°[2(0.675)/2.0] = 1.285
\ L J
s = l - 0.4 [*Lh*.\ = i - o.4[(2 X 0.481)/(2 X I)] = 0.808 > 0.60
V LIJ,L )
Next we will compute the bt factors:
77° = io° = 0.175 radians


We can now substitute into the Hansen equation, noting that with a horizontal ground surface all
gt = 1 (not 0):
<7uit = cNcsCtBdc>BiC)BbCtB+~qNqsqtBdqtBiqtBbq>B +
\yB'NySyyBdytBiytBby,B
Directly substituting, we have
qult = 25(20.7)(1.329)(1.06)(0.641)(0.93) +
0.3(17.5)(10.7)(1.285)(1.05)(0.675)(0.849) +
±(17.5)(2.0)(6.8)(0.808)(1.0)(0.481)(0.802)
= 434.6 + 43.4 + 37.1 = 515.1 kPa
For a stability number, or SF, of 3.0,

qa = tfuit/3 = 515.1/3 = 171.7-> 17OkPa (rounding)
fallow = AfXqa = (BX L)qa = (2 X 2 X 170) = 680 kPa > 600 (O.K.)
Vesic method. In using this method note that, with Hi = 0.0 and a square footing, it is only nec-
essary to investigate the B direction without double subscripts for the shape, depth, and inclination
terms. We may write
Nc = 20.7; Nq = 10.7 as before but N7 = 10.9
Nq/Nc = 0.514 2tan0(1 - sin0)2 = 0.311
The Vesic shape factors are

s< = l + W ' 77 = l + °-5 1 4 (2 /2 ) = 1-514

sq = 1 + ^ t a n 0 = 1 + (2/2)tan25° = 1.466

Sy = 1 - 0.4^7 = 1 - 0.4(1.0) = 0.60
Li
All d[ factors are the same as Hansen's, or
dc = 1.06 dq = 1.05 dy = 1.00
For the Vesic // factors, we compute m as


The bt factors are

OR
bc = 1 — - . . —T = 1.0 (since ground slope j8 = 0)
5.14 tan q>
bq = by = (1 - 77 tan <£)2 = (1 - 0.175 tan 25)2 = 0.843
The Vesic equation is
#uit = cNcscdcicbc + qNqsqdqiqbq + \yBNySydyiyby
Directly substituting (B = 2.0 m, y = 17.5 kN/m3, and D = 0.3 m), we have
quh = 25(20.7)(1.514)(1.06)(0.619)(1.0)+
0.3(17.5)(10.7)(1.466)(1.05)(0.655)(0.843)+
i(17.5)(2.0)(10.9)(0.60)(1.0)(0.494)(0.843)
= 514.1 + 47.7 + 47.7 = 609.5 kPa
qa = tfuit/3 = 609.5/3 = 203.2 -» 20OkPa
There is little difference between the Hansen (170 kPa) and the Vesic (200 kPa) equations. Never-
theless, let us do a confidence check using the Meyerhof equation/method.
Meyerhof method. Note Meyerhof does not have ground gt or tilted base factors &,-.

</> = 25° > 10° O.K. D/B' = 0.3A0 = 0.15
JTP = tan(45° + <f>/2) = tan 57.5° = 1.57; Kp = 2.464
See Meyerhof's equation in Table 4-1 and factors in Table 4-3:

Sc = i . o , ^ = Sy = 1 + OAKpj = 1 + 0.1(2.464)(2/2) = 1.25

dc = 1 +0.2jK~p- ^ = 1 +0.2(1.57)(0.15) = 1.05

dq = dy = 1 + 0.1 JTp - ^- = 1 + 0.1(1.57X0.15) = 1.02
B'
Let us define the angle of resultant 6 as
6 = t3Ln~l(H/V) = tan"1 (200/600) = 18.4°
Use 6 to compute Meyerhof's inclination factors:
ic = iq = (i - 0°/9O°)2 = (1 - 18.4/90)2 = 0.633
iy = (1 - 0/(J))2 = (1 - 18.4/25)2 = 0.0696 -> 0.07
Using Meyerhof's equation for an inclined load from Table 4-1, we have
qu\t = cNcscdcics + qNqSqdqiq + \yNysydyiy
Making a direct substitution (Meyerhof's Ni factors are the same as Hansen's), we write
4uu = 25(20.7)(l)(1.05)(0.633) + 0.3(17.5)(10.7)(1.25)(1.02)(0.633)+
|(17.5)(2.0)(6.8)(1.25)(1.02)(0.07)
= 344.0 + 45.3 + 10.6 = 399.9 kPa
The allowable qa = qtilt/3 = 399.9/3 = 133.3-» 13OkPa.


Terzaghi equation. As an exercise let us also use the Terzaghi equation:
Nc = 25.1 Nq = 12J N7 = 9.7 (from Table 4-2 at 0 = 25°)
Also, sc = 1.3 Sy = 0.8 (square base).
<7uit = cNcsc + qNq + \yBNySy
= (25)(25.1)(IJ) + 0.3(17.5)(12.7) + ±(17.5)(2.0)(9.7)(0.8)
= 815.8 + 66.7 + 135.8 = 1018.3 -> 1018 kPa
qa = W 3 = 1018/3 = 3 3 9 ^ 34OkPa

Summary. We can summarize the results of the various methods as follows:

Hansen 17OkPa
Vesic 225
Meyerhof 130
Terzaghi 340

The question is, what to use for qal The Hansen-Vesic-Meyerhof average seems most promising
and is qa^ = (170 + 225 + 130)/3 = 175 kPa. The author would probably recommend using qa =
175 kPa. This is between the Hansen and Vesic values; Meyerhof's equations tend to be conservative
and in many cases may be overly so. Here the Terzaghi and Meyerhof equations are not appropriate,
because they were developed for horizontal bases vertically loaded. It is useful to make the Terzaghi
computation so that a comparison can be made, particularly since the computations are not difficult.4

4-7 EFFECT OF WATER TABLE ON BEARING CAPACITY
The effective unit weight of the soil is used in the bearing-capacity equations for computing
the ultimate capacity. This has already been defined for q in the qNq term. A careful inspection
of Fig. 4-3 indicates that the wedge term 0.5yBN7 also uses the effective unit weight for the
soil.
The water table is seldom above the base of the footing, as this would, at the very least,
cause construction problems. If it is, however, the q term requires adjusting so that the sur-
charge pressure is an effective value. This computation is a simple one involving computing
the pressure at the GWT using that depth and the wet unit weight H- pressure from the GWT
to the footing base using that depth X effective unit weight y'. If the water table is at the
ground surface, the effective pressure is approximately one-half that with the water table at
or below the footing level, since the effective unit weight y' is approximately one-half the
saturated unit weight.
When the water table is below the wedge zone [depth approximately 0.55 tan(45 + <£/2)],
the water table effects can be ignored for computing the bearing capacity. When the water
table lies within the wedge zone, some small difficulty may be obtained in computing the

4-7 EFFECT OF WATER TABLE ON BEARING CAPACITY
The effective unit weight of the soil is used in the bearing-capacity equations for computing
the ultimate capacity. This has already been defined for q in the qNq term. A careful inspection
of Fig. 4-3 indicates that the wedge term 0.5yBN7 also uses the effective unit weight for the
soil.
The water table is seldom above the base of the footing, as this would, at the very least,
cause construction problems. If it is, however, the q term requires adjusting so that the sur-
charge pressure is an effective value. This computation is a simple one involving computing

the water table effects can be ignored for computing the bearing capacity. When the water
table lies within the wedge zone, some small difficulty may be obtained in computing the

effective unit weight to use in the 0.5yBNy term. In many cases this term can be ignored for a
conservative solution since we saw in Example 4-1 that its contribution is not substantial (see
also following Example). In any case, if B is known, one can compute the average effective
weight ye of the soil in the wedge zone as
ye = (2H - dw)^y^t + ^(H - dwf (4-4)

where H = 0.5Btan(45° + <J>/2)
dw = depth to water table below base of footing
y Wet = wet unit weight of soil in depth dw
y' = submerged unit weight below water table = ysat — yw
Example 4-8. A square footing that is vertically and concentrically loaded is to be placed on a
cohesionless soil as shown in Fig. E4-8. The soil and other data are as shown.

Required. What is the allowable bearing capacity using the Hansen equation of Table 4-1 and a
SF = 2.0?

Solution. We should note that B would, in general, not be known but would depend on the column
load and the allowable soil pressure. We could, however, compute several values of qa and make a
plot of qa versus B. Here we will compute a single value of qa.
Step 1. Since the effective soil unit weight is required, let us find these values. Estimate that the
"wet" soil has wN = 10 percent and G8 = 2.68.

Vs =

 GJTIOT) = 2.68^807) = °'626m3
Vv = 1.0 -V5 = 1.0 - 0.626 = 0.374 m3
The saturated unit weight is the dry weight + weight of water in voids, or
ysat = 16.45 + 0.374(9.807) = 20.12kN/m3
From Fig. E4-8 we obtain dw = 0.85 m and H = 0.5£tan(45° + (f>/2) = 2.40 m. Substituting into
Eq. (4-4), we have

Figure E4-8


Step 2. Obtain bearing-capacity factors for the Hansen equation using Tables 4-1 and 4-4. Do not
compute </>ps, since footing is square. For <f> = 35° use program BEARING on your diskette and
obtain
Nq = 33 Ny = 34 2 tan <£••• = 0.255 (also in Table 4-4)
Sq = i + L sin</> = 1.57 S7 = 1 - 0.4^7 = 0.6

dq = 1 + 2tan-- —

^ = 1 + 0 . 2 5 5 ^ i = 1.11 dy = 1.10

From Table 4-1 and dropping any terms that are not used or are 1.0, we have
^uIt = yDNqsqdq + 0.5yeB'Nysydy
Substituting values (note y = soil above base), we see
qult = l.l(18.10)(33)(1.57)(l.ll) + 0.5(14.86)(2.5)(34)(0.6)(L0)
= 1145 + 379 = 1524 kPa
1524
qa = —z— = 762 kPa (a very large bearing pressure)

It is unlikely that this large a bearing pressure would be allowed—a possible maximum is 500 kPa
(about 10 ksf). We might simply neglect the yeBNy term to obtain qa = 570 kPa (still large). If the
latter term is neglected, the computations are considerably simplified; and doing so has little effect
on what would normally be recommended as qa (around 500 kPa in most cases).

4-8 BEARING CAPACITY FOR FOOTINGS
ON LAYERED SOILS
It may be necessary to place footings on stratified deposits where the thickness of the top
stratum from the base of the footing d\ is less than the H distance computed as in Fig. 4-2. In
this case the rupture zone will extend into the lower layer(s) depending on their thickness and
require some modification of qu\t. There are three general cases of the footing on a layered
soil as follows:
Case 1. Footing on layered clays (all </> = 0) as in Fig. 4-5a.
a. Top layer weaker than lower layer (c\ < ci)
b. Top layer stronger than lower layer (c\ > c<i)
Case 2. Footing on layered 0-c soils with a, b same as case 1.
Case 3. Footing on layered sand and clay soils as in Fig. 4-5b.
a. Sand overlying clay
b. Clay overlying sand
Experimental work to establish methods to obtain qu\t for these three cases seems to be
based mostly on models—often with B < 75 mm. Several analytical methods exist as well,
and apparently the first was that of Button (1953), who used a circular arc to search for an
approximate minimum, which was found (for the trial circles all in the top layer) to give
Nc = 5.5 < 2rr as was noted in Sec. 4-2.


Figure 4-5 Footings on layered soil.
The use of trial circular arcs can be readily programmed for a computer (see program B-I
on diskette) for two or three layers using su for the layers. Note that in most cases the layer su
will be determined form qu tests, so the circle method will give reasonably reliable results. It
is suggested that circular arcs be limited to cases where the strength ratio CR = ci/c\ of the
top two layers is on the order of
0.6 < CR < 1.3
Where CR is much out of this range there is a large difference in the shear strengths of the
two layers, and one might obtain Nc using a method given by Brown and Meyerhof (1969)
based on model tests as follows:

For CR < 1

Nc,s = ^^- + 5.14Q < 5.14 (for strip footing) (4-5)
B
For a circular base with B = diameter

Nc,r = ^TT- + 6.05Q < 6.05 (for round base) (4-6)
B

(a) Footing on layered clay soil. For very soft C1 failure may occur
along sliding block labc and not a circular arc and
reduce Nc to a value less than 5.14.

Layer 1

Layer 2


When CR > 0.7 reduce the foregoing Ncj by 10 percent.
For CR > 1 compute:
Nu =4.14+^- (strip) (4-7)

N2 s = 4.14+ H ^ (4-7«)
0 137?
TVi r - 5.05 + —-— (round base) (4-8)
d\
A,2r = 5.05 + ^ (4-8a)

In the case of CR > 1 we compute both N\j and A^,; depending on whether the base is rect-
angular or round and then compute an averaged value of Ncj as

Na = *' *' ' 2 (4-9)
N\ti + N2J
The preceding equations give the following typical values of Ncj9 which are used in the
bearing-capacity equations of Table 4-1 for Nc.

CR = 0.4 2.0
di IB Strip Round N1)S N2)S NC)S
0.3 2.50 3.32 5.81 7.81 6.66
0.7 3.10 4.52 4.85 5.71 5.13
1.0 3.55 5.42 4.64 5.24 4.92

When the top layer is very soft with a small d\/B ratio, one should give consideration either
to placing the footing deeper onto the stiff clay or to using some kind of soil improvement
method. Model tests indicate that when the top layer is very soft it tends to squeeze out from
beneath the base and when it is stiff it tends to "punch" into the lower softer layer [Meyerhof
and Brown (1967)]. This result suggests that one should check this case using the procedure
of Sec. 4-2 that gave the "lower-bound" solution—that is, if qu\{ > Ac\ + q of Eq. (c) the soil
may squeeze from beneath the footing.
Purushothamaraj et al. (1974) claim a solution for a two-layer system with 0-c soils and
give a number of charts for Nc factors; however, their values do not differ significantly from
Nc in Table 4-4. From this observation it is suggested for cjy-c soils to obtain modified 4> and
c values as follows:

1. Compute the depth H = 0.5#tan(45 + <f)/2) using <f> for the top layer.
2. If H > d\ compute the modified value of (/> for use as5

9 H

5This procedure can be extended to any number of layers as necessary, and "weighting" may be used.


3. Make a similar computation to obtain c'.
4. Use the bearing-capacity equation (your choice) from Table 4-1 for qu\t with cf)f and c'.
If the top layer is soft (low c and small (f>) you should check for any squeezing using Eq. (c)
of Sec. 4-2.
For bases on sand overlying clay or clay overlying sand, first check if the distance H will
penetrate into the lower stratum. If H > d\ (refer to Fig. 4-5) you might estimate quu as
follows:

1. Find qu\t based on top-stratum soil parameters using an equation from Table 4-1.
2. Assume a punching failure bounded by the base perimeter of dimensions BXL. Here
include the q contribution from d\, and compute q'ult of the lower stratum using the base
dimension B. You may increase q'ult by a fraction k of the shear resistance on the punch
perimeter (2B + 2L) X ksu if desired.
3. Compare qu\t to q'ult and use the smaller value.
In equation form the preceding steps give the controlling qfult as
„ pPvKs tan (f) pdxc
9uit = tfuit + 7 + ~T— - tfuit (4-10)
Af Af
where qu\t = bearing capacity of top layer from equations in Table 4-1
#ult = bearing capacity of lower layer computed as for qu\t but also using B =
footing dimension, q = yd\; c, 4> of lower layer
p = total perimeter for punching [may use 2(B + L) or TT X diameter]
Pv = total vertical pressure from footing base to lower soil computed as J0 l yh dh+
qd\
Ks = lateral earth pressure coefficient, which may range from tan2(45 ± 4>/2) or
useATo from Eq. (2-18a)
tan </> = coefficient of friction between PVKS and perimeter shear zone wall
pd\ c = cohesion on perimeter as a force
Af = area of footing (converts perimeter shear forces to a stress)
This equation is similar to that of Valsangkar and Meyerhof (1979) and applies to all soils.
Note that there will not be many cases of a two- (or three-) layer cohesive soil with clearly
delineated strata. Usually the clay gradually transitions from a hard, overconsolidated surface
layer to a softer one; however, exceptions may be found, primarily in glacial deposits. In these
cases it is a common practice to treat the situation as a single layer with a worst-case su value.
A layer of sand overlying clay or a layer of clay overlying sand is somewhat more common,
and the stratification is usually better defined than for the two-layer clay.
A possible alternative for 4>-c soils with a number of thin layers is to use average values
of c and <fi in the bearing-capacity equations of Table 4-1 obtained as

(a)


where C1 = cohesion in stratum of thickness H1; c may be 0
<f>i = angle of internal friction in stratum of thickness //,; cf) may be zero

Any Ht may be multiplied by a weighting factor (1.0 is used in these equations) if desired.
The effective shear depth of interest is limited to approximately 0.5/?tan(45° + cf)/2). One or
two iterations may be required to obtain the best average 0-c values, since B is not usually
fixed until the bearing capacity is established.
One can use a slope-stability program such as that written by Bowles (1974a) to obtain
the bearing capacity for layered soils. The program given in that reference has been modified
to allow the footing pressure as a surcharge (program B-22). An increase in shear strength
with depth could be approximated by addition of "soils" with the same <f) and y properties
but increased cohesion strength. The ultimate bearing capacity is that value of qo producing
F = I .
Example 4-9. A footing of B = 3 X L = 6 m is to be placed on a two-layer clay deposit as in
Fig. E4-9.

Substituting values into Hansen's equation, we obtain

= 77(6.05)(l + 0.1 + 0.24) + 1.83(17.26)(1)(1)
= 624.2 + 31.5 = 655.7 kPa
Squeezing is not likely as d\ is fairly large compared to H and we are not using an Nc value much
larger than that for a one-layer soil.

Example 4-10. You are given the soil footing geometry shown in Fig. E4-10. Note that, with the
GWT on clay, it would be preferable to keep the footing in sand if possible.

Figure E4-10

Required, What is ultimate bearing capacity and qa if SF = 2 for sand and 3 for clay?

Solution, We will use Hansen's method. For the sand layer, we have
Nq = 29.4 N7 = 28.7 (using Table 4-4)
sq = 1 + tan 34° = 1.67 sy = 0.6
dq = 1 +0.262 P ^ j = 1.2 dy = 1
Substituting into Hansen's equation and rounding the TV factors (and using su = c = qu/2 =
75 kPa), we may write

Also

Sand


For clay, we have

Nc = 5.14 (using Table 4-4)
^ = 0 . 2 ( | ) = 0 . 2 ^ ) =0.2 sq = dq = \

d'c = 0.4 tan"1 ^ = 0.4 tan"1 R-M = 0.32 ( ^ > l)
B \ Z ) \B J
q"^ = 5.14(75)(1 4- 0.2 + 0.32) + 2.1(17.25)(1)(1)
= 622 kPa
Note: This su is common for the strength parameter for clay.
Now obtain the punching contribution. For the perimeter shear force on a strip 1 m wide, we
write

Pv = qdi + \ yh dh (kN/m)
Jo
Pv = 1.5(17.25)(0.6) +17.25 %-
2 J0
= 15.5 + 3.1 = 18.6 kN/m
Estimate K5 = K0 = 1 - sin</> [from Eq. (2-18a)] = 1 - sin 34° = 0.44. By inserting values
into Eq. (4-10), the revised maximum footing pressure based on the clay soil and including punching
is
, _ „ , PPyK5tan34° pdxc
<7uit - <7uit + 1 + ~k—
But cohesion is zero in sand and the perimeter is 2(2 + 2) = 8 m, so
qU = ^ + 8(18.6)(0.44)tan34° = ^ ^ < ^ rf ^

The maximum footing pressure is controlled by the clay layer, giving qu\t = 634 kPa. The allowable
footing contact soil pressure is
q = ^- - 211 (say, 200 kPa)

FOOTINGS ON ANISOTROPIC SOIL. This situation primarily occurs in cohesive soils
where the undrained vertical shear strength sUiV is different (usually larger) from the hori-
zontal shear strength su>h. This is a frequent occurrence in cohesive field deposits but also is
found in cohesionless deposits. To account for this situation (<j> = 0), Davis and Christian
(1971) suggest the following:

When you measure both vertical and horizontal shear strength (c = su\ compute the bear-
ing capacity as


When you only have sUfV, compute the bearing capacity as
quh = O.S5su,vNc+~^

In these two equations take Nc = 5.14 (Hansen's value). You may include Hansen's $,-, J1-,
and other factors at your own discretion, but they were not included by Davis and Christian
(1971).

4-9 BEARING CAPACITY OF FOOTINGS ON SLOPES
A special problem that may be encountered occasionally is that of a footing located on or
adjacent to a slope (Fig. 4-6). From the figures it can be seen that the lack of soil on the slope
side of the footing will tend to reduce the stability of the footing.
The author developed Table 4-7 using program B-2 on your diskette to solve the footing
on or adjacent to a slope as follows:

1. Develop the exit point E for a footing as shown in Fig. 4-6. The angle of the exit is taken
as 45° - (f>/2 since the slope line is a principal plane.
2. Compute a reduced Nc based on the failure surface ade = LQ of Fig. 4-3 and the failure
surface adE = L\ of Fig. 4-6a to obtain
K = NM
3. Compute a reduced Nq based on the ratio of area ecfg (call it A0) of Fig. 4-3 to the equiv-
alent area Efg = A^ of Fig. 4-6a, or the alternative Efgh = A^ of Fig. 4-6b, to obtain the
following:

* ; - <

Figure 4-6 Footings on or adjacent to a slope.

(a)

(b)


Note that when the distance b of Fig. 4-6b is such that A\ > A0 we have Nq = Nq. This
distance appears to be about b/B > 1.5 (or possibly 2).
4. The overall slope stability should be checked for the effect of the footing load using your
favorite slope-stability program or program B-22. At least a few trial circles should touch
point c of Fig. 4-6a,b as well as other trial entrance points on top of and on the slope.

The ultimate bearing capacity may be computed by any of the equations of Table 4-1;
however, the author suggests using the Hansen equation modified to read as follows:
<7uit = cN'cscic + WqSqiq + ^y BN^s7I7
Obtain the N'c and Nq factors from Table 4-7 [or use the included computer program B-2 if
interpolation is not desired]. The di factors are not included in the foregoing equation since
the depth effect is included in the computations of ratios of areas. It will be conservative to
use shape factors sc = sq = 1 (but compute sy).
The N7 factor probably should be adjusted to N7 to account for the reduction in passive
pressure on the slope side of the wedge caf of Fig. 4-6 when the base is either within the
b/B < 2 zone on top of the slope or when b/B = 0. Saran et al. (1989) proposed an analytical
solution to account for this reduction; however, the results do not seem adequately conserva-
tive and additionally there are too many algebraic manipulations for there to be great confi-
dence in the end result. A simpler solution that compares reasonably well with test results
(on models) is as follows:

1. Assume no reduction of N7 for b/B > 2 of Fig. 4-6b. Use computer program B-2 for D/B
and b/B < 2, for interpolation is not very accurate, especially for larger </> angles.
2. Use the Hansen N7 factor and adjust as follows:
a. Compute the Coulomb passive pressure coefficients for the slope angle /3 using
/3 = ( - ) for one computation and (+) for the other. See Chap. 11 (and use program
FFACTOR on furnished diskette). Use the friction angle S = c/> for both computa-
tions. When you use /3 = (+ or O) you are computing the passive pressure coefficient
Kp = KmSiX on the base side away from the slope and when /3 = ( - ) you are comput-
ing Kp = Kmin.
b. Now using Kmax and Km{n compute an R ratio as
K == ^min/^max
c. Obtain the Hansen value of N7 from Table 4-4 (or compute it). Now divide by 2 (allow
for a contribution of \ from either side of the wedge caf of Fig. 4-6a or b). The side
away from the wedge will contribute the full \ of N7, but the contribution from the
slope side will be a fraction depending on the foregoing R ratio and the distance b/B.
d. Now set up the following:
"r-M[**SjO-«]
This equation is easily checked:
At b/2B = 0: N7 = N7/2 + N7R/2 (on slope)
At b/2B = 2: N7 = 2N7/2 = N7 (top of slope and out of slope influence)

One should not adjust fa to 0p s , as there are considerable uncertainties in the stress state
when there is loss of soil support on one side of the base, even for strip (or long) bases.
The use of these factors and method will be illustrated in Example 4-11, which is based
on (and compared with) load tests from the cited source.

Example 4-11.

Given, Data from a strip footing load test for a base located on the top of a slope [from Shields et
al. (1977)]. Other data are as follows:
Slope /3 = 26.5° (1 on 2) and "compact" sand
fa = 36° (estimated from the author's interpretation of the reference figure of <j> vs. a^ (the
confining pressure)
c = 0 (no cohesion)
y = 14.85 kN/m3 (effective value and not very dense)
Consider two test cases:
Case I: b/B = 0.75 D/B = 1.50
Case II: b/B = 1.50 D/B = 0.0

Required, Compare the author's suggested method with Shield's test curves. Also for Case II com-
pare the author's method with Hansen's method using the ground factor gt.

Solution,
Case I:
(a) By Shieldsy method.

quit = cNc + \yBNyq (but c = 0)

From curves, obtain

Nyq « 120 [Fig. 11 of Shields et al. (1977)]

and

flat = ^(14.85)5(120) = 8915
(b) By Table 4-7 and using Hansen 's Ny. We will not adjust fa to cf)ps for reasons stated earlier
in this section. For a strip base all St = 1.0. Also here, since Ht = 0, all U = 1.0; because the base
is horizontal, bt = 1; and we take gt = 1 since this method already accounts for the slope angle /3.
From side computations of Chap. 11 (using program FFACTOR) obtain the Coulomb earth pres-
sure coefficients (using cf) = 36°, 8 = 36°, vertical wall, a = 90°) as
#m a x = 128.2 (/3 = 26.5°) #m i n = 2.8 (fi = -26.5°)
R = KmjKmax = 2.8/128.2 = 0.022 1.000 -R = 0.978
N7 = 40.0 and (refer to step d given just before this Example)
N7 = f + f [o.O22+A(0.978)]
= 20 + 20 [o.O22 + 2^(0.978)1 = 20 + 20(0.388)

= 27.8 -» 28 (and is less than 40 as expected)


At b/B = 1.5 (which we will use for Case II), we compute
Ar; = 20 + 20(0.756) = 35 (rounded)
For Case I Bowles' method gives

tfuit = qN'q + \yBN'y (D/B = 1.5, so D = 1.5B)
Also N'q = 27 [rounded and using program B-2 (or Table 4-7)]
quh = 14.85(1.5^(27) + ±(14.85)(B)(28)
= 6015 + 207£ = SOHB < S91B kPa
This result compares reasonably well to (within 10 percent) the 8915 actually measured.
Case II Let D/B = 0.0 (base on surface; q = 0) and b/B = 1.5 from edge of slope. From Shields
et al. (1977) we obtain approximately
tfuit = ±(14.85)5(35) = 2605 kPa
By Bowles' method and noting N'q = 27 as before and N'y = 35, we obtain
gtot = l£MfQ&)(21) + i(14.85)(5)(35) = 259.95-> 2605 kPa
By Hansen's method only the ^yBNygy term applies (since c — q = 0), so
gy = (1 -0.5tanj8)5 = (1 - 0.5tan26.5°)5 = 0.238
Directly substituting, we find
quit = 0 + 0 + i(14.85)5(35)(l)(l)(0.238) = 61.8 kPa
Inspection of the Vesic computation for gy gives gy = 0.251 > 0.238.
These computations indicate that Bowles' method appears to give the best solution based on
the limited load-test data available. Both the Hansen and Vesic methods appear too conservative
but were all that was available at the time they were proposed. Keep in mind that most real slopes
exist in soils with both c and <j> and not just sand, as in the model test used here for confirmation of
methodology. In any case the use of a sand model has severely tested the several methods.

4-10 BEARING CAPACITY FROM SPT
The SPT is widely used to obtain the bearing capacity of soils directly. One of the earliest
published relationships was that of Terzaghi and Peck (1967). This has been widely used,
but an accumulation of field observations has shown these curves to be overly conservative.
Meyerhof (1956, 1974) published equations for computing the allowable bearing capacity
for a 25-mm settlement. These could be used to produce curves similar to those of Terzaghi
and Peck and thus were also very conservative. Considering the accumulation of field obser-
vations and the stated opinions of the authors and others, this author adjusted the Meyerhof
equations for an approximate 50 percent increase in allowable bearing capacity to obtain the
following:

(4-11)

(4-12)


where qa = allowable bearing pressure for AH0 = 25-mm or 1-in. settlement, kPa or ksf
Kd = 1 + 0.33§ < 1.33 [as suggested by Meyerhof (1965)]

F factors as follows:

N55 Nl70
SI Fps SI Fps

F1 0.05 2.5 0.04 2.0
F2 0.08 4 0.06 3.2
F3 0.3 1 _ c
F4 1.2 4 S a m e S a m e

These equations have been in existence for quite some time and are based primarily on Af
values from the early 1960s back and, thus, Er is likely on the order of 50 to 55 and not 7O+
as suggested in Sec. 3-7. Since lower Er produces higher blow counts N if the preceding
equations are standardized to N'1Q, we must use revised values for factors F\ and F2 as shown
in the table of F factors. Summarizing, use the left values under Af55 and the given F factors,
or standardize N to Nj0 and use the right columns of F factors in Eqs. (4-11), (4-12), and
(4-13). Figure 4-7 is a plot of Eqs. (4-11) and (4-12) based on = N55.
In these equations N is the statistical average value for the footing influence zone of about
0.5B above footing base to at least 2B below. If there are consistently low values of N below
this zone, settlements may be troublesome if TV is not reduced somewhat to reflect this event.
Figure E4-12 is a method of presenting qa versus N for design office use.
We note in these equations that footing width is a significant parameter. Obviously if the
depth of influence is on the order of 2B a larger footing width will affect the soil to a greater
depth and strains integrated over a greater depth will produce a larger settlement. This is taken
into account somewhat for mats, which were considered also by Meyerhof (and adjusted by
the author for a 50 percent increase) to obtain

qa = ^rKd (4-13)

In these equations the allowable soil pressure is for an assumed 25-mm settlement. In general
the allowable pressure for any settlement AZZ7 is
4 - ^ . <«4)
where AH0 = 25 mm for SI and 1 in. for Fps. AHj is the actual settlement that can be
tolerated, in millimeters or inches. On a large series of spread footings on sand D'Appolonia et
al. (1968) found that use of the Meyerhof equations (4-11) and (4-12) when N55 was corrected
using CM of Eq. (3-3) predicted settlements very well. The sand involved, however, was either
overconsolidated or compacted to a very dense state. This soil state should have produced
somewhat higher blow counts (or N-values) than for a less dense state.
Parry (1977) proposed computing the allowable bearing capacity of cohesionless soils as
qa = 307V55 (kPa) (D < B) (4-15)

The bearing capacity factors for use in the Terzaghi bearing-capacity equation of Table 4-1
can be estimated [see Schmertmann (1978)] as
O.SNq = O.SNy = qc (4-17)
where qc is averaged over the depth interval from about BfI above to IAB below the footing
base. This approximation should be applicable for D/B < 1.5. For cohesionless soils one may
use
Strip quXt = 28 - 0.0052(300 - qc)L5 (kg/cm2) (4-18)
Square quU = 48 - 0.009(300 - qc)15 (kg/cm2) (4-18a)

Equations (4-18) through (4-19a) are based on charts given by Schmertmann (1978) credited
to an unpublished reference by Awakti.
According to Meyerhof (1956) the allowable bearing capacity of sand can be computed
using Eqs. (4-11) and (4-12), making a substitution for qc as
N55 = I (4-20)
and with qc in units of kg/cm2. If qc is in units other than kg/cm2(= tsf) you must convert
to these units prior to using Eq. (4-20). Note also that making the foregoing conversion of
qc to N55 to use Eqs. (4-11) and (4-12) adjusts the original Meyerhof recommendations to a
50 percent increase of the allowable bearing capacity as similarly done for directly obtained
SPT N values.
It is evident that one can use the CPT correlations of Sec. 3-11 to obtain <f> or su so that the
bearing capacity equations of Table 4-1 can be used more directly.

4-12 BEARING CAPACITY FROM FIELD LOAD TESTS
Obviously the most reliable method of obtaining the ultimate bearing capacity at a site is
to perform a load test. This would directly give the bearing capacity if the load test is on a
full-size footing; however, this is not usually done since an enormous load would have to be
applied. Such a load could be developed from two piles driven into the ground with a very
large girder spanning between them so a hydraulic jack could be placed on the footing to
jack against the girder for the footing load. This is very costly as one consideration; another
factor is that the bearing capacity obtained is for that size only and if there is more than one
size then additional tests would be required. For the test just described the cost could be very
high.

4-12.1 Standard Method
The usual practice is to load-test small steel plates (although one could also pour small con-
crete footings, which would be troublesome to remove if that location were needed for other
purposes) of diameters from 0.3 to 0.75 m or squares of side 0.3 X 0.3 and perhaps 0.6 X 0.6
m. These sizes are usually too small to extrapolate to full-size footings, which may be 1.5 to
4 or 5 m2. Several factors cause the extrapolation to be questionable:

1. The significant influence depth of approximately AB is substantially different for the
model-versus-prototype footing. Any stratification below the H depth of Fig. 4-2 or Fig.
A-3b has minimal effect on the model but may be a major influence on the full-size footing.
2. The soil at greater depths has more overburden pressure acting to confine the soil so it is
effectively "stiffer" than the near-surface soils. This markedly affects the load-settlement
response used to define qu\t.
3. Previous discussion has noted that as B increases there is a tendency to a nonlinear increase
in qu\t. It develops that for small models of say, 0.3, 0.45, and 0.6 m, the plot of B versus
qu\t is nearly linear (as it is for using two sizes of, say, 2 m and 2.5 m). It takes a larger
range of sizes to develop the nonlinear curve for that soil deposit.


Figure 4-8 Plate-load testing. The method of performing this test is outlined in some detail in ASTM D 1194.

In spite of these major shortcomings, load tests are occasionally used. The procedure has
been standardized as ASTM D 1194, which is essentially as follows:

1. Decide on the type of load application. If it is to be a reaction against piles, they should
be driven or installed first to avoid excessive vibration and loosening of the soil in the
excavation where the load test will be performed.
2. Excavate a pit to the depth the test is to be performed. The test pit should be at least four
times as wide as the plate and to the depth the foundation is to be placed. If it is specified
that three sizes of plates are to be used for the test, the pit should be large enough so that
there is an available spacing between tests of 3D of the largest plate.
3. A load is placed on the plate, and settlements are recorded from a dial gauge accurate to
0.25 mm. Observations on a load increment should be taken until the rate of settlement is
beyond the capacity of the dial gauge. Load increments should be approximately one-fifth
of the estimated bearing capacity of the soil. Time intervals of loading should not be less
than 1 h and should be approximately of the same duration for all the load increments.
4. The test should continue until a total settlement of 25 mm is obtained, or until the capacity
of the testing apparatus is reached. After the load is released, the elastic rebound of the
soil should be recorded for a period of time at least equal to the time duration of a load
increment.

Figure 4-8 presents the essential features of the load test. Figure 4-9a is a typical semilog
plot of time versus settlement (as for the consolidation test) so that when the slope is approx-
imately horizontal the maximum settlement for that load can be obtained as a point on the
load-versus-settlement curve of Fig. 4-9b. Where the load-versus-settlement approaches the
vertical, one interpolates qu\t. Sometimes, however, qu\t is obtained as that value correspond-
ing to a specified displacement (as, say, 25 mm).
Extrapolating load-test results to full-size footings is not standard. For clay soils it is com-
mon to note that the BN7 term is zero, so that one might say that qu\t is independent of footing

In cohesionless (and (j>-c) soils all three terms of the bearing-capacity equation apply and,
noting that the N7 term includes the footing width, one might say
. „„, M +, ^AVr —^foundation
£>load test
where M includes the Nc and Nq terms and TV is the Ny term. By using several sizes of
plates this equation can be solved graphically for qu\t. Practically, for extrapolating plate-
load tests for sands (which are often in a configuration so that the Nq term is negligible), use
the following

/^foundation \ {A ^1 X
ttilt = 4plate[—B (4-21)
V Opiate /
The use of this equation is not recommended unless the BfOUndation/#piate is not much more
than about 3. When the ratio is 6 to 15 or more the extrapolation from a plate-load test is little
more than a guess that could be obtained at least as reliably using an SPT or CPT correlation.

4-12.2 Housel's Method for Bearing Capacity
from Plate-Load Tests
Housel (1929) and Williams (1929) both6 gave an equation for using at least two plate-load
tests to obtain an allowable load P8 for some settlement as
P5 = Aqx + pq2 (kPa or ksf) (4-22)

6Housel is generally given credit for this equation; however, when Williams presented it no credit was given, so
the equation may have been proposed simultaneously by both persons.

where A = area of plate used for the load test, m2 or ft2
p = perimeter of load-test plate, m or ft
q\ = bearing pressure of interior zone of plate, kPa or ksf
Qi = edge shear of plate, kN/m or k/ft

Equation (4-22) is used as follows:

1. Perform two or more load tests using plates with different A and /?. Plot curves of either
load P or bearing pressure q versus settlement A//.
2. At the desired settlement obtain from these plots the load Ps (= q • A if the plot is pressure
q versus settlement A//). One possible set of values is at \Pu\t, however, values at plate
settlements of 6, 10, or 15 mm might also be used.
3. Using Ps, plate area, and perimeter solve Eq. (4-22) for q\, #2- For more than two tests
make as many solutions as possible and average the results for q\, #2-

For example, consider these data:
Test# B,m A, m2 p,m P5, kN
1 0.45 0.452 = 0.2025 4 X .45 = 1.8 30.4
2 0.60 0.602 = 0.3600 4 X .60 = 2.4 45.1

which give

0.202541 + 1.8^2 = 30.4
0.3600#! +2.4^2 = 45.1
On solving, we obtain q\ = 50.83 kPa and q2 = II. 17 kN/m.
It is now necessary to solve by trial to find footing dimensions for a given design load. The
following illustrates the approach.
The allowable Pa for a base that is 3x3 m is
Pa = (3X3)50.83 + (4X3)11.17 = 591.5 kN
If the design load Pd ~ 591.5 kN, use this trial B. If the design load is less, use a smaller
B and make another trial computation, etc., until the computed footing load has converged
within reasonable limits. Remember that your selection of the Ps values has approximately
set the settlement for that base of dimension B.
This method is generally called Housel's method. It was widely used until the early 1950s
even though Terzaghi (1929) did not approve of it and did not even mention it in Terzaghi
(1943), where the Terzaghi bearing-capacity method was first introduced.

4-13 BEARING CAPACITY OF FOUNDATIONS WITH
UPLIFT OR TENSION FORCES
Footings in industrial applications—such as for the legs of elevated water tanks, anchor-
ages for the anchor cables of transmission towers, and bases for legs of power transmission


Figure 4-10 Footings for tension loads.

towers—and in a number of industrial equipment installations are subjected to uplift or ten-
sion forces. Uplift may be the principal mode of resistance or may be among several possible
load combinations. Drilled shafts, with or without enlarged bases, are most commonly used
to resist uplift because they are more economical to install. The analysis of these members
will be considered in Sec. 16-14.
Footings to develop tension resistance are idealized in Fig. 4-10. Balla (1961) considered
this problem. He assumed a failure surface (the dashed line ab in Fig. 4-10) as circular and
developed some highly complicated mathematical expressions that were verified on model
tests in a small glass jar and by some larger tests of others. The only footings he considered
were circular. Meyerhof and Adams (1968) also considered the problem and proposed the
conditions of Fig. 4-10, namely, that footings should be considered as either shallow or deep
since deep footings could develop only to some limiting pull-out force. Circular and rectan-
gular footings were considered and in both cohesive and cohesionless soils. They compared
the theory (following equations) with models as well as full-scale tests on circular footings
and found considerable scatter; however, with a factor of safety of 2 to 2.5 these equations
should be satisfactory.
The following equations are developed by neglecting the larger pull-out zone observed in
the tests (as ab of Fig. 4-10) and using an approximation of shear resistance along line ab1.
Shape factors are used together with a limiting depth ratio D/B or H/B to make the simplified
equations adequate for design use. In the general case we have for the ultimate tension
T11 = Perimeter resistance, supD + Base weight W
with adjustments for depth and shape (whether perimeter is round or rectangular). This equa-
tion gives (only for footings in sands) the following:

For shallow footings

Round: Tu = TTBSUD + sf7rBy — \KU tan <£ + W (4-23)
Rectangular: T11 = 2suD(B + L) + yD2(2sfB + L - B)KU tan <f> + W (4-24)

Rectangular: Tu = 2sM#(£ + L) 4- y(2D - H)(Is f B + L - B)HKn tan <f> + W (4-26)
where s/ = 1 + mH/B.

Obtain shape factor sy, ratios m and H/B [all /(</>)] from the following table—interpolate as
necessary:

Maximum sf 1.12 1.30 1.60 2.25 4.45 5.50 7.60
For example: <f> = 20° so obtain 5/ = 1.12, m = 0.05, and H/B = 2.5. Therefore, H = 2.5B, and total
footing depth to be a "deep" footing D > 2.5B. If B = 1 m, D of Fig. 4-10 must be greater
than 2.5 m, or else use "shallow footing" equations [Eqs. (4-23) or (4-24)].

The lateral earth pressure coefficient Kn can be taken as one of the following:
K11 = tan2 (45° + *)=*/> K11 = tanjW + | ) = JTP
Kn = tan2 (45° "t)=Ka Ku = 0.65 + 0.50 (0 in radians)
^M = K0 = 1 — sin <f>
With these several choices the user must make a judgment analysis for Ku. Using K0 or an
average of Kp, K0, and Ka may be reasonable.
The equations for a rectangular footing in tension are based on an assumption made by
Meyerhof that the shape factor is acting on the end parts in a zone of B/2 along L and the
interior part of (L - B) is similar to a long strip footing with s/ = 1. Most tension footings,
however, are round (common) or square.
For footings founded in very poor soils, Robinson and Taylor (1969) found that a satisfac-
tory design resistance for transmission tower anchorages could be obtained by using only the
weight term W in Eqs. (4-23) through (4-26) and with a safety factor slightly greater than one.
Compute the footing weight W based on the volume of the footing concrete plus the weight
of any soil that will be uplifted when the base is pulled up. If the footing is a poured concrete
shaft (with or without an enlarged base) in clay, use about 80 percent of the shaft length to


compute a perimeter area. The perimeter is based on TTB\ where Br is either the diameter of
the shaft or that of the base if it is larger or belled. This perimeter area is used with adhesion
defined as k • su between shaft perimeter zone and foundation soil. The use of 0. SD allows for
soil damage or tension cracks in the upper zone of the embedment depth. The tension force
is now computed as
Tu = W + TrB'(0.SD)k-su
In general, one reduces the ultimate tension resistance to the design value Ta as

la ~ SF
where the safety factor may range from, say, 1.2 to 4 or 5 depending on the importance of
the footing, reliability of the soil parameters, and the likelihood that quality backfill over the
footing will produce a reliable W term and a reasonably adequate shear zone along line ab'.

Example 4-13. A footing 1.2 X 1.2 X 0.6 m is placed at a depth of 1.80 m in a soil of y =
17.29 kN/m3;<£ = 20°; su = 2OkPa.
Required. Estimate the allowable uplift force for a SF = 2.5.

Solution. D/B = 1.8/1.2 = 1.5 < H/B = 2.5 for cj> = 20°; therefore, the footing is classed as
shallow and we will use Eq. (4-24) to calculate Tu.
Tu = 2suD(B + L) + yD2(2sfB + L- B)KUtan0 + W
Sf = I + ^ - = 1 +0.05(1.5) = 1.075 < 1.12 in table preceding this example
B
Several values of K11 are as follows:
(45° + —20° \

 = 2.04 = Kp

Ku= JK~P = 1.43
Ku = 0.65 + 0.50 = 0.82
Ku = K0 = \ - sin 20° = 0.658
Average Ku = (2.04 + 1.43 + 0.82 + 0.66)/4 = 1.24
W = Weight of concrete + Weight of soil uplifted
W = 1.2(1.2)(0.6)(23.6) + 1.2(1.2)(1.8 - 0.6)(17.29) = 50.3 kN
Substituting values into Eq. (4-23), we find
T14 = 2(20)( 1.8)(1.2 + 1.2) + 17.29(1.8)2[2(1.075)(l.2) + 1.2 - 1.2](1.24)tan20°
+ 50.3
= 172.8 + 65.2 + 50.3 = 288.3 kN

Ta = ^ = HSkN

The structural design of this anchor footing would be on the basis of Ta X some SF (or load factor).


4-14 BEARING CAPACITY BASED ON BUILDING
CODES (PRESUMPTIVE PRESSURE)
In many cities the local building code stipulates values of allowable soil pressure to use when
designing foundations. These values are usually based on years of experience, although in
some cases they are simply used from the building code of another city. Values such as these
are also found in engineering and building-construction handbooks. These arbitrary values of
soil pressure are often termed presumptive pressures. Most building codes now stipulate that
other soil pressures may be acceptable if laboratory testing and engineering considerations
can justify the use of alternative values. Presumptive pressures are based on a visual soil
classification.
Table 4-8 indicates representative values of building code pressures. These values are
primarily for illustrative purposes, since it is generally conceded that in all but minor con-
struction projects some soil exploration should be undertaken. Major drawbacks to the use of
presumptive soil pressures are that they do not reflect the depth of footing, size of footing,
location of water table, or potential settlements.

4-15 SAFETY FACTORS IN FOUNDATION DESIGN
Buildings are designed on the basis of determining the service loads and obtaining a suitable
ratio of material strength to these loads, termed either a safety or a load factor. None of the
quantities in this factor is precisely known, so that codes or experience are relied upon to
develop the ratio as, one hopes, a lower-bound value—the real value is this or something
larger. Engineering materials such as steel and concrete are manufactured with strict quality
control; nevertheless, in strength design for concrete the effective ultimate strength is taken as
85 percent of the unconfined compressive strength. The yield stress for steel and other metals
is a lower-bound value—in the case of steel on the order of 10 to 20 percent less than the
general range of measured yield strengths. Thus, a "safety factor" of sorts is already applied.
Code values used to develop live and other loads are a compromise between upper and
near-upper bound. Building self-weight, or dead load, is reasonably identified (at least after
the structure is designed). Either the service loads are multiplied by a suitable set of load
factors and compared with the "ultimate strength," or the structural material or the yield
strength is divided by a suitable safety or load factor7and compared with the loads. We note
in passing that in concrete strength design the load factors for dead and live loads represent
in a limited way the different degrees of uncertainty associated with each type of loading.
There are more uncertainties in determining the allowable strength of the soil than in the
superstructure elements. A number of these uncertainties can be deduced from discussions
in Chaps. 2 and 3. These may be summarized as follows:

Complexity of soil behavior
Lack of control over environmental changes after construction
Incomplete knowledge of subsurface conditions
Inability to develop a good mathematical model for the foundation
Inability to determine the soil parameters accurately

These uncertainties and resulting approximations have to be evaluated for each site and a
suitable safety factor directly (or indirectly) assigned that is not overly conservative but that
takes into account at least the following:

1. Magnitude of damages (loss of life, property damage, and lawsuits) if a failure results
2. Relative cost of increasing or decreasing SF
3. Relative change in probability of failure by changing SF
4. Reliability of soil data
5. Changes in soil properties from construction operations, and later from any other causes
6. Accuracy of currently used design/analysis methods

It is customary to use overall safety factors on the order of those shown in Table 4-9. Shear
should be interpreted as bearing capacity for footings. Although the SF values in Table 4-9

7At this writing (1995), the terms usually used are load factor for designing the superstructure elements and safety
factor for estimating the allowable soil pressure.

do not appear larger than for, say, steel design, the uncertainties in developing the allowable
shear stress (in most cases) produce larger real safety factors than shown. For example, as
shown in Example 4-4 using qa = qu, the apparent SF = 3 + . But qu is obtained from very
disturbed samples, so that the value may only be 50 to 60 percent of the in situ value resulting
in the true SF being much larger. Further, where settlement controls, the allowable bearing
capacity will be further reduced—which in turn further increases the real safety factor.
Some persons [Hansen (1967), Meyerhof (1970)] advocate consideration of partial safety
factors for the soil parameters, e.g., using a value of, say, 1.2 to 1.3 on 0 and 1.5 to 2.5 on
cohesion. The latter are larger, since cohesion is somewhat more state-dependent.
The design load is obtained from the most critical of several possible cases. Using the
load-term abbreviations of Table 4-10 and code-load factors Rt, the following might be in-
vestigated:

Design load = RDDL + R1LL + RSS + HS (SF = 3.0)

Live load (LL) Any load not permanently attached to the structure, but to
which the structure may be subjected
Snow load (S) Acts on roofs; value to be used generally stipulated by codes
Wind load (W) Acts on exposed parts of structure
Earthquake (E) A lateral force (usually) that acts on the structure
Hydrostatic (HS) Any loads due to water pressure; may be either (+) or (-)
Earth pressure (EP) Any loads due to earth pressures—commonly lateral but may
be in other directions


A number of other possible load combinations, including 0.5LL and DL, E and HS, etc. are
commonly investigated. It is usual to use smaller safety factors for transitory loads such as
wind and earthquake but this requirement is not absolute.
We should especially note that the geotechnical consultant will make a recommendation
for an allowable strength (bearing capacity, etc.) that has the safety factor already included.
The structural designer then factors this value or factors the loads to produce the design.
In general the structural designer should not arbitrarily assume the geotechnical consultant
used a specific value of SF as in Table 4-9. Rather the recommendation is what should be
used. If the designer has a high load intensity from some transitory load combination the
recommended bearing pressure should not be arbitrarily increased one-third, or whatever,
without first discussing this with the geotechnical consultant.

4-16 BEARING CAPACITY OF ROCK
With the exception of a few porous limestone and volcanic rocks and some shales, the strength
of bedrock in situ will be greater than the compressive strength of the foundation concrete.
This statement may not be true if the rock is in a badly fractured, loose state where consid-
erable relative slip between rock fragments can occur. The major problem is to identify the
rock soundness and on occasion take cores for unconfined compression testing of the intact
fragments. On very important projects and where it is economically feasible, one may make
in situ strength tests.
Settlement is more often of concern than is the bearing capacity, and most test effort is
undertaken to determine the in situ deformation modulus E and Poisson's ratio so that some
type of settlement analysis can be made. This comment is made since most rock loads are
from piles or drilled piers with the points embedded to some depth into the rock mass. Thus,
one must make an analysis based on a load on the interior of a semi-infinite elastic body.
The finite-element method FEM is sometimes used, but if the rock is fractured results are
speculative unless one has measured data that can be used to revise the model. Even if the rock
is not fractured the FEM seldom provides good results because uncertain elastic parameters
are used.
It is common to use building code values for the allowable bearing capacity of rock; how-
ever, geology, rock type, and quality (as RQD) are significant parameters, which should be
used together with the recommended code value. It is common to use large safety factors
in rock capacity. The SF should be somewhat dependent on RQD defined in Sec. 3-17; i.e.,
an RQD of 0.80 would not require as high an SF as for RQD = 0.40. It is common to use
SF from 6 to 10 with the higher values for RQD less than about 0.75 unless RQD is used
to reduce the ultimate bearing capacity (as shown following). Table 4-11 may be used as a
guide to estimate bearing capacity from code values or to obtain trial elastic parameters for
preliminary FEM analyses.
One may use bearing-capacity equations of the form given by Terzaghi in Table 4-1
to obtain the bearing capacity of rocks using the angle of internal friction and cohesion of
the rock from high-pressure triaxial tests. According to Stagg and Zienkiewicz (1968, p. 151)

*Depends heavily on confining pressure and how determined; E = tangent modulus at approximately 50 percent of ultimate
compression strength.

the bearing-capacity factors for sound rock are approximately
Nq = tan6 J45° + | J Nc = 5 tan4 J45° + | J N7 = Nq + 1 (4-27)
Use the Terzaghi shape factors of Table 4-1 with these bearing-capacity factors. The rock
angle of internal friction is seldom less than 40° (often 45° to 55°) and rock cohesion ranges
from about 3.5 to 17.5 MPa (500 to 2500 psi). It is evident from Eq. (4-27) that very high
values of ultimate bearing capacity can be computed. The upper limit on allowable bear-
ing capacity is, as previously stated, taken as /c' of the base concrete or not more than the
allowable bearing pressure of metal piles.
The angle of internal friction of rock is pressure-dependent, similar to soil. Also, inspection
of rock parameters from a number of sources indicates that, similar to sand, we could estimate
(f) = 45° for most rock except limestone or shale where values between 38° and 45° should
be used. Similarly we could in most cases estimate su = 5 MPa as a conservative value.
Finally we may reduce the ultimate bearing capacity based on RQD as
<7uit = <7uit(RQD)2
In many cases the allowable rock-bearing pressure is taken in the range of one-third to one-
tenth the unconfined compression strength obtained from intact rock samples and using RQD
as a guide, for example, as one-tenth for a small RQD. Others simply use an allowable bearing
pressure from the local building code (as in Table 4-8) based on rock type from a visual
inspection of the rock cores.
Few building foundations such as mats or spread bases are placed directly on rock. Most
situations involving rock-bearing capacity require large-diameter drilled shafts (termed
drilled piers as in Chap. 19), which are socketed 2 to 3 shaft diameters into the rock. Recent
load tests on this type of foundation [see Rowe and Armitage (1987)] indicate the allowable
bearing pressure is on the order of
qa = qu to 2.5qu
where qu = unconfined compression strength of intact rock core samples. This value is sub-
stantially larger than the values of one-third and one-tenth previously cited. The large increase


in allowable pressure can be at least partially attributed to the triaxial confining effect devel-
oping at the pier base from the embedment depth. The lower values previously suggested are
applicable for foundations located at the rock surface.
When rock coring produces no intact pieces of consequence (RQD —> 0) one should treat
as a soil mass and obtain the bearing capacity using equations from Table 4-1 and best esti-
mates of the soil parameters cf) and c.

Example 4-14. We have a drilled pier with a diam. = 1 m to be founded at a depth of 3.5 m into
a rock mass to get through the surface irregularities and the weathered rock zone as determined by
coring to a depth of 6.5 m into the rock. From the cores the average RQD = 0.50 (or 50 percent)
below the pier point.

Required, Estimate the allowable bearing capacity for the pier base. For the pier concrete we will
use /c' = 28 MPa (allowable fc is, of course, somewhat less).

Solution. Assume from inspection of the rock cores that </> = 45° and take c = 3.5 MPa (both
reasonably conservative—cohesion may be overly so).
The Terzaghi shape factors are sc = 1.3 and sy = 0.6. Assume the unit weight of the dense rock
7 rock = 25.15 kN/m3. Compute the following:
Nc = 5 tan4 45° + -~- J = 170

Nq = tan6 (45° + -~- J= 198
N7 = Nq + 1 = 199
We will omit the soil overburden pressure to the soil-rock interface. Substituting in, and dividing
by 1000 where necessary to convert to MPa, we have
tfuit = cNcsc + qNq + Q.5yBNySy
<i W17HM % + 3.5(25.15X198) 0.5(25.15)(l)(199)(0.6)
= (3.5X170)1.3 + ^ + —
= 773.5 + 17.4 + 1.5 = 792.4MPa
Use a SF = 3 and RQD = 0.5 to obtain the reduced allowable bearing pressure as
qa = ^fl = 792.4(0.25) = 6 6 M p a
This appears O.K., because 66 = 2.4 X /c'
Recommend qa = 30 MPa as this is approximately f'c.

Comments. Since /c' is seldom over 40 MPa for drilled piers we see bearing capacity of rock is
seldom a controlling factor. It may be more critical for steel HP piles, however—depending on
whether one uses the actual or projected area for bearing.
////

We might question in the previous example why unconfined or triaxial compression tests
were not performed to obtain the strength parameters. These could have been done since the
cores are available; however, the following are major considerations:


1. For either type of test, several rock samples with an L/d > 2 would have to be cut with
the ends accurately flat and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. This is costly.
2. Tests on intact rock samples where the RQD = 0.5 can give an incorrect strength for the
mass.
3. Testing an intact sample for qu would give c = qjl but no </> angle, so the Nc term of Eq.
(4-27) could not be obtained (tan6 45° = 1 is not a good estimate). A qu strength is too
low for intact rock.
4. Testing a triaxial sample requires access to high-pressure cell capabilities or else the re-
sults are little better than qu values. This still requires making an estimate of lateral cell
pressure to duplicate in situ confinement. Using an estimate for cell pressure makes it
difficult to justify the test expense.

As a final note, what can one do if the bearing pressure is inadequate? In this case we have
options. We can go deeper into the rock or we can utilize skin resistance of the shaft-to-rock
interface (considered in more detail in Chap. 19). We can abandon the site, or we can treat the
rock. Rock treatment usually involves drilling a number of small holes and pressure-injecting
cement grout to fill the cracks to provide mass continuity after the grout hardens. The latter
requires further coring to see if the joints have been adequately grouted.

5-1 THE SETTLEMENT PROBLEM
Foundation settlements must be estimated with great care for buildings, bridges, towers,
power plants, and similar high-cost structures. For structures such as fills, earth dams, levees,
braced sheeting, and retaining walls a greater margin of error in the settlements can usually
be tolerated.
Except for occasional happy coincidences, soil settlement computations are only best es-
timates of the deformation to expect when a load is applied. During settlement the soil tran-
sitions from the current body (or self-weight) stress state to a new one under the additional
applied load. The stress change Aq from this added load produces a time-dependent accu-
mulation of particle rolling, sliding, crushing, and elastic distortions in a limited influence
zone beneath the loaded area. The statistical accumulation of movements in the direction of
interest is the settlement. In the vertical direction the settlement will be defined as AH.
The principal components of AH are particle rolling and sliding, which produce a change
in the void ratio, and grain crushing, which alters the material slightly. Only a very small frac-
tion of A// is due to elastic deformation of the soil grains. As a consequence, if the applied
stress is removed, very little of the settlement AH is recovered. Even though AH has only
a very small elastic component, it is convenient to treat the soil as a pseudo-elastic material
with "elastic" parameters E59 G', /i,, and ks to estimate settlements. This would appear reason-
able because a stress change causes the settlement, and larger stress changes produce larger
settlements. Also experience indicates that this methodology provides satisfactory solutions.
There are two major problems with soil settlement analyses:

1. Obtaining reliable values of the "elastic" parameters. Problems of recovering "undis-
turbed" soil samples mean that laboratory values are often in error by 50 percent or more.
There is now a greater tendency to use in situ tests, but a major drawback is they tend
to obtain horizontal values. Anisotropy is a common occurrence, making vertical elastic

values (usually needed) different from horizontal ones. Often the difference is substantial.
Because of these problems, correlations are commonly used, particularly for preliminary
design studies. More than one set of elastic parameters must be obtained (or estimated) if
there is stratification in the zone of influence H.
2. Obtaining a reliable stress profile from the applied load. We have the problem of com-
puting both the correct numerical values and the effective depth H of the influence zone.
Theory of Elasticity equations are usually used for the stress computations, with the in-
fluence depth H below the loaded area taken from H = 0 to H -» o° (but more correctly
from 0 to about AB or 5B). Since the Theory of Elasticity usually assumes an isotropic,
homogeneous soil, agreement between computations and reality is often a happy coinci-
dence.

The values from these two problem areas are then used in an equation of the general form

AH = \ edH
Jo
where e = strain = Aq/Es\ but Aq = f(H, load), Es = f(H, soil variation), and H (as pre-
viously noted) is the estimated depth of stress change caused by the foundation load. The
principal focus in this chapter will be on obtaining Aq, Es and H.
It is not uncommon for the ratio of measured to computed AH to range as 0.5 <— ^mea* —>
2. Current methodology tends to minimize "estimation" somewhat so that most ratios are in
the 0.8 to 1.2 range. Note too that a small computed AH of, say, 10 mm, where the measured
value is 5 or 20 mm, has a large "error," but most practical structures can tolerate either the
predicted or measured value. What we do not want is an estimate of 25 mm and a subsequent
settlement of 100 mm. If we err in settlement computations it is preferable to have computed
values larger than the actual (or measured) ones—but we must be careful that the "large"
value is not so conservative that expensive (but unneeded) remedial action is required.
Settlements are usually classified as follows:

1. Immediate, or those that take place as the load is applied or within a time period of about
7 days.
2. Consolidation, or those that are time-dependent and take months to years to develop. The
Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy has been undergoing consolidation settlement for over 700
years. The lean is caused by the consolidation settlement being greater on one side. This,
however, is an extreme case with the principal settlements for most projects occurring in
3 to 10 years.

Immediate settlement analyses are used for all fine-grained soils including silts and clays
with a degree of saturation S ^ 90 percent and for all coarse-grained soils with a large coef-
ficient of permeability [say, above 10~3 m/s (see Table 2-3)].
Consolidation settlement analyses are used for all saturated, or nearly saturated, fine-
grained soils where the consolidation theory of Sec. 2-10 applies. For these soils we want
estimates of both settlement AH and how long a time it will take for most of the settlement
to occur.


Both types of settlement analyses are in the form of

AH = eH = V - ^ (i = 1 to n) (5-1)

where the reader may note that the left part of this equation is also Eq. (2-43<z). In practice
the summation form shown on the right may be used where the soil is subdivided into layers
of thickness Ht and stresses and properties of that layer used. The total settlement is the sum
obtained from all n layers. The reader should also note that Es used in this equation is the
constrained modulus defined from a consolidation test as \/mv or from a triaxial test using
Eq. (e) of Sec. 2-14, written as

ts~ m

v~ (1 + M )(1-2/1)

 {5la)
where ESyir = triaxial value [also used in Eq. (5-16)]. Note, however, that if the triaxial cell
confining pressure 0-3 approximates that developed in situ when the load is applied, the tri-
axial Es will approximate l/mv. In most cases the actual settlements will be somewhere be-
tween settlements computed using the equivalent of \/mv as from a consolidation test [see Eq.
(5- Ia)] and Es from a triaxial test. Unfortunately the use of Eq. (5- Ia) also requires estimating
a value of Poisson's ratio /JL.

5-2 STRESSES IN SOIL MASS DUE
TO FOOTING PRESSURE
As we see from Eq. (5-1), we need an estimate of the pressure increase Ag from the applied
load. Several methods can be used to estimate the increased pressure at some depth in the
strata below the loaded area. An early method (not much used at present) is to use a 2 : 1
slope as shown in Fig. 5-1. This had a great advantage of simplicity. Others have proposed
the slope angle be anywhere from 30° to 45°. If the stress zone is defined by a 2 : 1 slope, the

which simplifies for a square base (B X B) to

where terms are identified on Fig. 5-1. This 2 : 1 method compares reasonably well with more
theoretical methods [see Eq. (5-4)] from z\ = Bio about zi = 4B but should not be used in
the depth zone from z = 0 to B. The average stress increase in a stratum (H = Zi ~ Z\) is

5-3 THE BOUSSINESQ METHOD FOR qv
One of the most common methods for obtaining qv is the Boussinesq (ca. 1885) equation based
on the Theory of Elasticity. Boussinesq's equation considers a point load on the surface of a
semi-infinite, homogeneous, isotropic, weightless, elastic half-space to obtain
qv = 2 ^ 2 c o s 5 0 (5-3)
where symbols are identified on Fig. 5-2a. From this figure we can also write tan0 = r/z,
define a new term R2 = r2 + z2, and take cos5 6 — (z/R)5. With these terms inserted in Eq.

Figure 5-2 (a) Intensity of pressure q based on Boussinesq approach; (b) pressure at point of depth z below the
center of the circular area acted on by intensity of pressure qo.

lrThe vertical base load uses P, V, and Q in this textbook and in the published literature; similarly, stress increases
from the base load are qv, Aqv, p, and A/?.


(5-3) we obtain

* = 3S (5-4)

which is commonly written as
qv = ^ IAl + (r/z)2]5/2 = I A, (5-5)
Since the A^ term is a function only of the r/z ratio we may tabulate several values as follows:

±r/z 0.000 0.100 0.200 0.300 0.400 0.500 0.750 1.000 1.500 2.000
Ab OAIl 0.466 0.433 0.385 0.329 0.273 0.156 0.084 0.025 0.008

////
These values may be used to compute the vertical stress in the stratum as in the following
two examples.

Example 5-1. What is the vertical stress beneath a point load Q = 225 kN at depths of z = Om,
0.6 m, 1.2 m, and 3.0 m?
Solution. We may write qv = (Q/z2)Ab = OAllQ/z2 (directly beneath Q we have r/z = 0). Sub-
stituting z-values, we obtain the following:

Chart Methods
The purpose of foundations is to spread loads so that "point" loads with the accompanying
very high stresses at the contact point (z = 0 of Example 5-1) are avoided. Thus, direct
use of the Boussinesq equation is somewhat impractical until z is at a greater depth where
computations indicate the point and spread load stress effects converge. We can avoid this by
considering the contact pressure qo to be applied to a circular area as shown in Fig. 5-2Z? so
the load Q can be written as

This equation can be used to obtain the stress qv directly at depth z for a round footing of radius
Y (now r/z is a depth ratio measured along the base center). If we rearrange this equation, solve
for r/z, and take the positive root,

The interpretation of Eq. (c) is that the r/z ratio is also the relative size of a circular bearing
area such that, when loaded, it gives a unique pressure ratio qjqo on the soil element at a
depth z in the stratum. If values of the qv/qo ratio are put into the equation, corresponding

values of r/z may be obtained as follows:

qjqo = 0.0 0.100 0.200 0.300 0.400 0.500 0.600 0.700 0.800 0.900 1.00
±r/z = 0.0 0.270 0.400 0.518 0.637 0.766 0.918 1.110 1.387 1.908 °o

These values may be used to draw the Newmark (1942) chart in Fig. 5-3. The use of the
chart is based on a factor termed the influence value, determined from the number of units into
which the chart is subdivided. For example, if the series of rings is subdivided so that there are
400 units, often made approximate squares, the influence value is 1/400 = 0.0025. In making
a chart it is necessary that the sum of the units between two concentric circles multiplied by
the influence value be equal to the change in the qjqo of the two rings (i.e., if the change in
two rings is 0.1 qvlq0, then the influence value / multiplied by the number of units M should
equal 0.1). This concept enables one to construct a chart of any influence value. Figure 5-3 is

Influence value 0.005

lunit


subdivided into 200 units; therefore, the influence value is 1/200 = 0.005. Smaller influence
values increase the number of squares and the amount of work involved, since the sum of
the squares used in a problem is merely a mechanical integration of Eq. (a). It is doubtful if
much accuracy is gained using very small influence values, although the amount of work is
increased considerably.
The influence chart may be used to compute the pressure on an element of soil beneath a
footing, or from pattern of footings, and for any depth z below the footing. It is only necessary
to draw the footing pattern to a scale of z = length AB of the chart. Thus, if z = 5 m, the
length AB becomes 5 m; if z = 6 m, the length AB becomes 6 m; etc. Now if AB is 20
mm, scales of 1 : 250 and 1 : 300, respectively, will be used to draw the footing plans. These
footing plans will be placed on the influence chart with the point for which the stress Aq(< qv)
is desired at the center of the circles. The units (segments or partial segments) enclosed by
the footing or footings are counted, and the increase in stress at the depth z is computed as
Aq = qoMI (5-7)

where Aq = increased intensity of soil pressure due to foundation loading at depth z in
units of qo
qo = foundation contact pressure
M = number of units counted (partial units are estimated)
/ = influence factor of the particular chart used

The influence chart is difficult to use, primarily because the depth z results in using an odd
scale factor based on line AB in the figure. It has some value, however, in cases where access
to a computer is not practical and there are several footings with different contact pressures
or where the footing is irregular-shaped and Aq (or qv) is desired for some point.
For single circular footings, a vertical center pressure profile can be efficiently obtained
by using Eq. (5-6) on a personal computer. For square or rectangular footings the concept
of the pressure bulb as shown in Fig. 5-4 is useful. The pressure bulbs are isobars (lines of
constant pressure) obtained by constructing vertical pressure profiles (using similar to that
of Fig. 1-Ia) at selected points across the footing width B and interpolating points of equal
pressure intensity (0.9, 0.8, 0.1qo, etc.).

Numerical Methods for Solving the Boussinesq Equation
There are two readily available methods to obtain a vertical pressure profile using the Boussi-
nesq equation and a computer. The first method is that used in program SMBWVP on your
diskette (also applicable to the Westergaard equation of Sec. 5-5) as follows:

a. The square or rectangular base (for a round base convert to an equivalent square as
B = VTrr2 ) with a contact pressure of qo is divided into small square (or unit) areas
of side dimension a so a series of "point" loads of Q = qoa2 can be used. Use side di-
mensions a on the order of 0.3 X 0.3 m (1 X 1 ft). Using very small a dimensions does
not improve the result. The vertical pressure contributions from several bases can be
obtained. The pressure at a point beneath a base such as the center, mid-side, or corner
can be obtained from that footing as well as contributions from adjacent footings.


Figure 5-4 Pressure isobars (also called pressure bulbs) based on the Boussinesq equation for square and long
footings. Applicable only along line ab from center to edge of base.

b. Input the location where the vertical pressure is wanted. Usually the x, z coordinates of
this point are taken as the origin. Other bases (and this one if the point is under it) are
referenced to the point where the vertical pressure is to be computed by distance DIST
(see DTWAL of Fig. 11- 19a) to the/ar side of the base and a perpendicular distance DOP
[(+) to right side of DIST] to the base edge. Other bases that may contribute pressure are
similarly referenced but in most cases bases not directly over the point can be treated as
point loads. The pressures may be computed at any starting input depth Y0; this may be
at the ground surface or some point below. You can obtain a pressure profile using equally
spaced depth increments DY or the vertical pressure at a single depth (DY = O). For five

Square Continuous


depth increments input number of vertical points NVERT = 6; for 10 input NVERT =
11, etc.
c. The program computes the center x, y coordinates of each unit area making up a base. The
program recognizes the base dimensions in terms of the number of unit squares in each
direction NSQL, NSQW that is input for that base. In normal operation you would input
both DIST and DOP as (+) values along with the side dimensions of the square SIZE and
contact pressure qo (QO). The program then locates the x, z coordinates of the center of
the first square (farthest from point and to right) and so on. These would be used with a
point load of Q = qoa2 in Eq. (5-4) to obtain one pressure contribution. There would be
NSQW X NSQL total contributions for this footing.
A point load would use a single unit (NSQW = 1; NSQL = 1 ) area of a = 0.3 m.
For example, if we have a point load at a distance of z = 1.1m from the pressure point,
we would input NSQW = 1,NSQL = 1,DIST = 1.1+0.3/2 = 1.25, and DOP = 0 +
0.3/2 = 0.15 m. The program would locate the point load correctly on the DIST line at
Z= 1.1m and x = 0.15 — 0.3/2 = 0 using a single unit area (0.3 X 0.3 m). These values
of 1.1, 0.0, YO and pressure qo = QO = Qact/a2 would give the vertical pressure at the
point of interest; i.e.,if Q = 90 kN, input QO = 90/(0.3 X 0.3) = 1000 kPa.
For several contributing footings this process would be repeated as necessary to get the
total increase in vertical pressure Aq at this depth YO.
d. The depth is incremented if more vertical points are required to a new YO = YO + DY,
the process repeated, and so on.

The program has an option to output the pressure (and some checking data) for each depth
increment and to output the pressure profile in compact form. It also gives the average pres-
sure increase in the stratum (sum of pressures divided by number of points) for direct use in
settlement computations.
Another method that is applicable to square or rectangular bases (and round ones converted
to equivalent squares) is to use the Boussinesq equation integrated over a rectangle of dimen-
sions BXL. This is not a simple integration, but it was done by a number of investigators
in Europe in the 1920s, although the most readily available version is in Newmark (1935)
and commonly seen as in the charts by Fadum (1948). The equation given by Newmark—
applicable beneath the corner of an area B X L—is
1 \2MN JV V + 1 _! (2MN ^V^
* = *5F[-VTVT— + tan [-V^l (5-8)
D T
w h e r e M = - N = - (qv = q o f o r z = 0 )
V = M2 4- W2 + 1
Vx = (MN)2
When Vi > V the tan"1 term is (—) and it is necessary to add IT. In passing, note that sin"1
is an alternate form of Eq. (5-8) (with changes in V) that is sometimes seen. This equation
is in program B-3 (SMNMWEST) on your diskette and is generally more convenient to use
than Fadum's charts or Table 5-1, which usually requires interpolation for influence factors.
The vertical stress at any depth z can be obtained for any reasonable proximity to or beneath
the base as illustrated in Fig. 5-5 and the following examples.

Figure 5-5 Method of using Eq. (5-8) to obtain vertical stress at point indicated.

In general use, and as in the following examples, it is convenient to rewrite Eq. (5-8) as
Ag = qotnlo- (5-8fl)
where Ia is all terms to the right of qo in Eq. (5-8) as tabulated for selected values of M and
N in Table 5-1.
The Boussinesq method for obtaining the stress increase for foundation loads is very
widely used for all types of soil masses (layered, etc.) despite it being specifically devel-
oped for a semi-infinite, isotropic, homogeneous half-space. Computed stresses have been
found to be in reasonable agreement with those few measured values that have been obtained
to date.

Example 5-3. Find the stress beneath the center (point O) and corner of Fig. 5-5a for the following
data:
B x 5 = 2 m X 2 m g = 800 kN
At corner z = 2m
At center for z = 0,1,2, 3, and 4 m

Solution. It is possible to use Table 5-1; however, program SMNMWEST (B-3) on your diskette
is used here for convenience (Table 5-1 is used to check the programming).

(c) Point outside loaded area = dcfg.
For point O: use Obfh — Obce -
Oagh + Oade.

(d) For loaded area: kicdgm.
For point O: Obce + Oaqf+ Ofml
+ Olkj + Ojib - Oade.

{a) Square loaded area = O'ebd.
For point O: use 4 x Oabc.
For point O'\ use O'ebd.

(b) Rectangle with loaded area = O'gbd.
For point O: use Oabc + Ocde + OeO'f+ Ofga.
For point 0': use O'gbd.

Example 5-4. Find the stress at point O of Fig. 5-5c if the loaded area is square, with dg = dc =
4 m, ad = Im, and ed = 3 m for qo = 400 kPa and depth z = 2 m.

Solution. From the figure the stress /^ is the sum of Ob/7* — Obce — Oagh + Oade, and m = 1.

For MN Ia
Obfh 5/2 7/2 +0.243
Ofcce 1/2 7/2 -0.137

5-4 SPECIAL LOADING CASES
FOR BOUSSINESQ SOLUTIONS
On occasion the base may be loaded with a triangular or other type of load intensity. A number
of solutions exist in the literature for these cases but should generally be used with caution
if the integration is complicated. The integration to obtain Eq. (5-8) is substantial; however,
that equation has been adequately checked (and with numerical integration using program
SMBWVP on your program diskette) so it can be taken as correct. Pressure equations for
triangular loadings (both vertical and lateral) are commonly in error so that using numerical
procedures and superposition effects is generally recommended where possible. Equations
for the cases of Fig. 5-6 have been presented by Vitone and Valsangkar (1986) seem to be
correct since they give the same results as from numerical methods. For Fig. 5-6a we have

where R2B = B2 + z2

These equations can be checked by computing the stresses at A and C and summing. The
sum should equal that at any depth z for a rectangular uniformly loaded base. This check is
illustrated in Example 5-5.

Solution. We will use the Newmark Eq. (5-8) and check it using Eqs. (5-9) and (5-10). For the
Newmark method, draw the side view of the footing as shown in Fig. E5-5 and step the load inten-
sity, so we have a series of strips loaded uniformly with the intensity fraction shown. The first strip
is 1 ft X 8 ft, the second 2 ft X 8 ft, etc., so that we will have to subtract from strips after the first a
fraction of the previous strip load to obtain the net strip contribution to the point at depth z = 10 ft.
We will find the stresses at both A and C and use the sum as a check since it can be readily seen that

Example 5-5. Given the footing example in the ASCE Journal of Geotechnical Engineering Divi-
sion, vol. 110, No. 1, January 1984, p. 75 (which has an error), find the vertical pressure beneath
the corners A and C at z = 10 ft. This footing is L = 8 ft X B — 6 ft with a linearly varying load
from 0 at A to 1 ksf at C across the 6-ft width.

Area


Summing, we have at A and C = 0.055 56 + 0.069 13 = 0.124 69 ksf. A uniform load of 1 ksf gives Lqa = A#c = 0.1247 ksf based
on Table 5-1 at M = 0.6, N = 0.8. Using Eq. (5-9), we have RD = 14.14;/?| = 136; /?J = 164 and by substitution of values we obtain
A^ = 0.055 36 ksf for point A and 0.069 33 ksf for point C.

Example 5-6. Let us assume that we are to redo Example 5-5. We do not have access to the New-
mark methodology or Eq. (5-9) but do have access to Eq. (5-4). From the data given in Example
5-5 we have B = 6 ft; L = 8 ft; and depth z = 10 ft. We are to use Fps units consistent with both
the reference and Example 5-5.

Solution. Referring to Fig. 5-6a, we see the center of the resultant is at

x = \B = \ - 6 = 4.0 ft y = ^ = 5 = 4.0 ft z = 10 ft

RA = Jx1 + v2 + z2 = V42 + 42 + 102 = 11.489 ft (to corner A)
Rc = V22 + 42 + 102 = 10.954 ft (to corner C)
Q = BLq0H = (6)(8)(l)/2 = 24 kips

the sum is exactly equivalent to a uniform load of 1 ksf on the footing. Note that Ia = constant but
load intensity varies going from A to C and from C to A. A table will be convenient (again refer to
Fig. E5-5):

purist some of the differences shown in Table E5-6 are substantial, but may be adequate—even
conservative—for design purposes in an engineering office—and certainly the point load equation
[Eq. (5-4)] is the easiest of all methods to use.

i SIMPLE METHOD FOR ALL SPECIAL LOADING CASES. Example 5-6 illustrates that
/hen the load pattern is difficult (for example, a base covered with an uneven pile of material


producing a nonuniform load), the following procedure is adequate for design:

1. Locate the load resultant as best you can so critical footing locations such as corners, the
center, and so forth can be located using JC, y coordinates with respect to the load resultant.
2. For the case of depth z = 0, use the computed contact pressure as your best estimate. You
must do this since z — 0 computes a value of qv = 0 or undefined (o°) in Eq. (5-4).
3. For depth z > 0 compute the value R and use Eq. (5-4). For cases where R < z, Eq. (5-4)
will not give very good values but may be about the best you can do. In Example 5-6 note
that R is not much greater than z, but the answers compare quite well with the known
values.
4. Consider using Table E5-6 as a guide to increase proportionately your Boussinesq pres-
sures, as computed by Eq. (5-4), to approximate more closely the "exact" pressure values
obtained by the numerical method. For example you actually have an R = 2.11 m (which
corresponds exactly to the 4.0 ft depth on Table E5-6, so no interpolation is required), and
you have a computed gy,Comp = 9.13 kPa at point A. The "corrected" (or at least more
nearly correct) qv can be computed as follows:
_ gu.nm
qv — A </i;,comp
<lv,b

where qv,nm = vertical pressure from numerical method (most correct)
qv,b = vertical pressure from Boussinesq Eq. (5-4)

so in our case above, we have

qv = J j ^ X 9.13 = 1.54 x 9.13 = 14.13 kPa
Pressures at other depth points would be similarly scaled. You might note that at the depth
of 3.05 m (10 ft) the ratio is 0.0555/0.0572 = 0.970 at point A.

5-5 WESTERGAARD'S METHOD FOR COMPUTING
SOIL PRESSURES
When the soil mass consists of layered strata of fine and coarse materials, as beneath a road
pavement, or alternating layers of clay and sand, some authorities are of the opinion the
Westergaard (1938) equations give a better estimate of the stress qv.
The Westergaard equations, unlike those of Boussinesq, include Poisson's ratio /JL, and the
following is one of several forms given for a point load Q:
- Q J" << \%\
qv
 2TTZ2 [a + (r/z)2]3^1 K }
where a = (1 - 2/z,)/(2 - 2/JL) and other terms are the same as in the Boussinesq equation.
We can rewrite this equation as

(5-13«)


as done for the Boussinesq equation. For JJL = 0.30 we obtain the following values:

r/z 0.000 0.100 0.200 0.300 0.400 0.500 0.750 1.000 1.500 2.000
Aw 0.557 0.529 0.458 0.369 0.286 0.217 0.109 0.058 0.021 0.010

Comparing the Boussinesq values A\, from Eq. (5-5), we see that generally the Westergaard
stresses will be larger. This result depends somewhat on Poisson's ratio, however, since /JL =
0 and r/z = 0.0 gives Aw = 0.318 (versus Ab = 0.477); for/x = 0.25 and r/z = 0.0 obtain
Aw = 0.477.
Similarly as for the Boussinesq equation [Eq. (a) and using Fig. 5-2b] we can write

After integration we have the direct solution for round footings analogous to Eq. (5-6):

«-«•('- 7«^;) <5-14)
From some rearranging and using the (+) root,
r _ I a 7 ~
z " WO"?/?*)2 a
If this equation is solved for selected values of Poisson's ratio and incremental quantities
of q/qo, as was done with the Boussinesq equation, values to plot a Westergaard influence
chart may be computed. Since the Westergaard equation is not much used, construction of an
influence chart (done exactly as for the Boussinesq method but for a given value of /x) is left
as an exercise for the reader.
If use of the Westergaard equations is deemed preferable, this is an option programmed
into SMBWVP on your diskette. For programming, the integration of stresses for a rectangle
of B X L gives the following equation [used by Fadum (1948) for his stress charts] for the
corner of a rectangular area (and programmed in SMNMWEST) as

where M, Af are previously defined with Eq. (5-8) and a has been defined with Eq. (5-13).
The tan"1 term is in radians. This equation can be readily used to obtain a vertical stress
profile as for the Boussinesq equation of Eq. (5-8) for rectangular and round (converted to
equivalent square) footings. To check programming, use the following table of values:

M M N Ia

0.45 1.0 1.0 0.1845
0.45 1.0 0.5 0.1529

At z = 0 we have a discontinuity where we arbitrarily set Ag = qo for any base-on-ground
location.


5-6 IMMEDIATE SETTLEMENT COMPUTATIONS
The settlement of the corner of a rectangular base of dimensions B' X L' on the surface of
an elastic half-space can be computed from an equation from the Theory of Elasticity [e.g.,
Timoshenko and Goodier (1951)] as follows:
A / , ^ i _ ^ ( , + l^,2);f 05.1«

where qo = intensity of contact pressure in units of Es
B1 = least lateral dimension of contributing base area in units of AH
Ii = influence factors, which depend on L'/B\ thickness of stratum H, Poisson's
ratio /i, and base embedment depth D
ESf /Ji = elastic soil parameters—see Tables 2-7, 2-8, and 5-6
The influence factors (see Fig. 5-7 for identification of terms) h and I2 can be computed
using equations given by Steinbrenner (1934) as follows:
i [ , (i+ JM2+ I)JM2+ N2 _ (M+ VM2 + I)VI+A^2 ]
Ix = — M In , =— + In - = = = = = = — ya)
IT I M(I + VM2 + W2 + 1) M + VM2 + N2 + 1
I2 = —tan"1 ( M I (tan"1 in radians) (b)
2^ \N JM2 + N2 + i /
V
where M = -

The influence factor Ip is from the Fox (19482?) equations, which suggest that the set-
tlement is reduced when it is placed at some depth in the ground, depending on Poisson's
ratio and L/B. Figure 5-7 can be used to approximate Ip. YOU can also use Table 5-2, which
gives a select range of I\ and /2 values, to compute the composite Steinbrenner influence
factor ls as
Is = h + X~f^h (C)
1 - IL
Program FFACTOR (option 6) can be used to obtain both Ip and Is directly; you have only to
input appropriate base dimensions (actual L, B for Ip and B', Il for Is) and Poisson's ratio /JL.
Equation (5-16) can be written more compactly as follows:

^H = 4oB' * mlslp (5-16a)

where Is is defined in Eq. (c) and m = number of corners contributing to settlement AH. At
the footing center m = 4; at a side m = 2, and at a corner m = 1. Not all the rectangles have
to have the same L'/B' ratio, but for any footing, use a constant depth H.
This equation is strictly applicable to flexible bases on the half-space. The half-space may
consist of either cohesionless materials of any water content or unsaturated cohesive soils.
The soils may be either inorganic or organic; however, if organic, the amount of organic
material should be very small, because both E5 and /x are markedly affected by high organic
content. Also, in organic soils the foregoing equation has limited applicability since secondary
compression or "creep" is usually the predominating settlement component.
In practice, most foundations are flexible. Even very thick ones deflect when loaded by
the superstructure loads. Some theory indicates that if the base is rigid the settlement will be
uniform (but may tilt), and the settlement factor Is will be about 7 percent less than computed
by Eq. (c). On this basis if your base is "rigid" you should reduce the Is factor by about 7
percent (that is, Isr = 0.931IS).
Equation (5-16a) is very widely used to compute immediate settlements. These estimates,
however, have not agreed well with measured settlements. After analyzing a number of cases,
the author concluded that the equation is adequate but the method of using it was incorrect.
The equation should be used [see Bowles (1987)] as follows:

1. Make your best estimate of base contact pressure qo.
2. For round bases, convert to an equivalent square.
3. Determine the point where the settlement is to be computed and divide the base (as in the
Newmark stress method) so the point is at the corner or common corner of one or up to 4
contributing rectangles (see Fig. 5-7).

4. Note that the stratum depth actually causing settlement is not at H/B —> °°, but is at either
of the following:
a. Depth z — 5B where B = least total lateral dimension of base.
b. Depth to where a hard stratum is encountered. Take "hard" as that where E8 in the hard
layer is about XQE8 of the adjacent upper layer.
5. Compute the H/B' ratio. For a depth H = z = 5B and for the center of the base we have
H/B1 = 5B/0.5B = 10. For a corner, using the same H, obtain 5B/B = 5. This computa-
tion sets the depth H = z = depth to use for all of the contributing rectangles. Do not use,
say, H = 5B = 15 m for one rectangle and H = 5B = 10 m for two other contributing
rectangles—use 15 m in this case for all.
6. Enter Table 5-2, obtain I\ and /2, with your best estimate for /UL compute I8, and obtain If
from Fig. 5-7. Alternatively, use program FFACTOR to compute these factors.
7. Obtain the weighted average E8 in the depth z = H. The weighted average can be com-
puted (where, for n layers, H = 2 " Ht) as
H\ES\ H- H2E& + • • • H- HnE8n

Table 5-3 presents a number of cases reanalyzed by the author using the foregoing pro-
cedure. It can be seen that quite good settlement estimates can be made. Earlier estimates
were poor owing to two major factors: One was to use a value of E5 just beneath the base
and the other was to use a semi-infinite half-space so that I8 = 0.56 (but the /2 contribution
was usually neglected—i.e., /x = 0.5). A curve-fitting scheme to obtain I8 used by Gazetas
et al. (1985) appeared to have much promise for irregular-shaped bases; however, using the
method for some cases in Table 5-3 produced such poor settlement predictions compared with
the suggested method that these equations and computation details are not recommended for
use. Sufficient computations are given in Bowles (1987) to allow the reader to reproduce Es
and AH in this table.
This method for immediate settlements was also used to compute estimated loads for a
set of five spread footings [see Briaud and Gibbens (1994)] for purposes of comparison with
reported measured values for a settlement of AH = 25 mm. A substantial amount of data
was taken using the test methods described in Chap. 3, including the SPT, CPT, PMT, DMT,
and Iowa stepped blade. For this text the author elected to use only the CPT method with qc
obtained by enlarging the plots, estimating the "average" qc by eye for each 3 m (10 ft) of
depth, and computing a resulting value using

ZH1
It was reported that the sandy base soil was very lightly overconsolidated so the cone
constant was taken as 5.5 for all footings except the 1 X 1 m one where the size was such that
any soil disturbance would be in the zone of influence. Clearly one can play a numbers game
on the coefficient, however, with 3.5 regularly used for normally consolidated soils and from
6 to 30 for overconsolidated soils (refer to Table 5-6), any value from 4 to 7 would appear
to apply—5.5 is a reasonable average. With these data and using the program FFACTOR
on your diskette for the IF and I8 (which were all 0.505, because the bases were square and

needed Fps values in the original reference were converted to SI.

Example 5-7. Estimate the settlement of the raft (or mat) foundation for the "Savings Bank Build-
ing" given by Kay and Cavagnaro (1983) using the author's procedure. Given data are as follows:
qo = 134 kPa B X L = 33.5 X 39.5 m measured AH = about 18 mm
Soil is layered clays with one sand seam from ground surface to sandstone bedrock at
- 14 m; mat at - 3 m.
Es from 3 to 6 m = 42.5 MPa Es from 6 to 14 m = 60 MPa
Es for sandstone > 500 MPa

Solution. For clay, estimate JJL = 0.35 (reference used 0.2). Compute

Interpolating in Table 5-2, we obtain Ix = 0.0815; I2 = 0.086:

f = 3I5 =0.09; use/F =0.95

(The factor 1000 converts MPa to kPa and m to mm.)


This estimate is rather good when compared to the measured value of 18 mm. If this were made
for a semi-infinite elastic half-space (a common practice) we would obtain (using E5 just under
the mat)

AH = 134 [ 1 6 / 7 5 ( ^ ^ ( 4 X 0.56 X 0.95 X 1000)1 = 98.6 mm

which is seriously in error. You should study the reference and these computations to appreciate
the great difficulty in making settlement predictions and then later trying to verify them—even
approximately.

5-7 ROTATIONOFBASES
It is sometimes necessary to estimate the rotation of a base. This is more of a problem with
bases subjected to rocking moments producing vibrations (considered in more detail in Chap.
20), however, for static rotations as when a column applies an overturning moment it may be
necessary to make some kind of estimate of the rotation.
A search of the literature produced five different solutions—none of which agreed well
with any other—for flexible base rotation under moment. On this basis, and because theo-
retical solutions require full contact of base with the soil and with overturning often the full
base area is not in contact, the best estimate would be made using a finite difference solution.
The finite difference solution is recommended since the overturning moment can be modeled
using statics to increase the node forces on the pressed side and decrease the node forces
on the tension side. The average displacement profile across the base in the direction of the
overturning effort can be used to obtain the angle of rotation. This computer program is B-19
in the package of useful programs for Foundation Design noted on your diskette.
Alternatively, the footing rotation can be expressed (see Fig. 5-8) as
tan* = '-if WZ1* (5"17)
where M = overturning moment resisted by base dimension B. Influence values IQ that may
be used for a rigid base were given by Taylor (1967) as in Table 5-5. Values of IQ for a flexible
base are given by Tettinek and Matl (1953, see also Frolich in this reference p. 362). These
flexible values are intermediate to those of several other authorities. The rotation spring of

tThere are several "rigid" values; these are from equations given by Taylor (1967, Fig. 9, p. 227). They
compare reasonably well with those given by Poulos and Davis (1974, p. 169, Table 7.3).

Table 20-2 may also be used to compute base rotation. Most practical footings are intermedi-
ate between "rigid" and "flexible" and require engineering judgment for the computed value
of footing rotation 6.
Using a computer program such as B19 or the influence factors of Table 5-5 gives a nearly
linear displacement profile across the footing length L. This result is approximately correct
and will produce the constant pressure distribution of Fig. 4-4a since the soil will behave sim-
ilarly to the compression block zone used in concrete beam design using the USD method.
In that design the concrete strains are assumed linear but the compression stress block is
rectangular. One could actually produce this case using program B19 (FADMATFD) if the
nonlinear switch were activated and the correct (or nearly correct) value of maximum lin-
ear soil displacement XMAX were used. Enough concrete beam testing has been done to
determine that the maximum linear strain is approximately 0.003. Finding an XMAX that
would produce an analogous rectangular pressure profile under the pressed part of a footing
undergoing rotation would involve trial and error. Making several runs of program B19 with
a different XMAX for each trial would eventually produce a reasonable rectangular pressure
profile, but this is seldom of more than academic interest. The only XMAX of interest in this
type of problem is one that gives

q = XMAX -ks^qa
When this is found the resulting average displacement profile can be used to estimate base
and/or superstructure tilt.

Example 5-8.

Given. A rectangular footing with a column moment of 90 kN • m and P = 500 kN. Footing is
3 X 2 X 0.5 m thick. The soil parameters are Es = 10000 kPa, ju, = 0.30. The concrete column is
0.42 X 0.42 m and has a length of 2.8 m, and Ec = 27.6 X 106 kPa. Estimate the footing rotation


and find the footing moment after rotation assuming the upper end of the column is fixed as shown
in Fig. E5-8.

Substitution of/, Ec, L, and 6 gives the released column moment of
M = ^27.6x10^(2.593x10-3X1.274x10-3) =

Since the rotation is equivalent to applying a moment of 130 kN • m opposite to the given M of
90 kN • m, the footing moment is reduced to zero and the base 6 < 0.073°. There is also a change
in the "far-end" column moment that is not considered here.

5-8 IMMEDIATE SETTLEMENTS: OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
We can interpret Eq. (5-16a) in terms of the Mechanics of Materials equation
Atf = ™ = <± = eH
AE E
as previously given (and using symbols consistent with this text) where
6 = qo/Es H = B(I- fJL2)mIJF
The major problems, of course, are to obtain the correct Es and H. It has already been noted
with reference to Table 5-3 that one should use the weighted average value of E5 in the
influence depth H. Obviously if H is fairly large and one obtains somehow only one value of
Es the resulting computation for AH may not be very reliable unless that one value happens
to be the "weighted average" on a chance basis.
It is evident that for the usual range of Poisson's ratio /JL of 0.2 to 0.4, this parameter
has little effect on AH (using the extreme range from 0 to 0.5 only produces a maximum
difference of 25 percent).
The influence depth H can be estimated reasonably well as noted with reference to Table
5-3 by taking the smaller of 5B or the depth to the hard layer, where the "hard" layer was
defined as that where the stress-strain modulus was > 10 times Es of the next adjacent layer.
One will have to use some judgment if the soil grades from stiff to stiffer so that a factor of
10 is not clearly defined.
Finally we note that the depth factor If can reduce computed settlements considerably for
fl/B-> 1.
Determination of the Stress-Strain Modulus Es
Several methods are available for determining (actually estimating) the stress-strain modulus:

1. Unconfined compression tests
2. Triaxial compression tests
3. In situ tests
a. SPT
b. CPT
c. Pressuremeter
d. Flat dilatometer
e. Iowa stepped blade
/ Plate-load tests

Unconfined compression tests tend to give conservative values of E5; i.e., the computed
value (usually the initial tangent modulus) is too small, resulting in computed values of AH
being large compared with any measured value. If the value of AH is excessively2 large, the
selection of foundation type may be adversely affected; that is, a recommendation for piles
or caissons might be made when, in fact, spread footings would be satisfactory.

2Termed overly conservative in engineering lexicon.

Previous Page


Triaxial tests tend to produce more usable values of E8 since any confining pressure "stiff-
ens" the soil so that a larger initial tangent modulus is obtained. Other factors such as whether
the triaxial test is a U, CU, or C^f0U tend to affect the E8 obtained (see Sec. 2-14). Generally
triaxial tests will also be conservative but not quite so much as unconfined compression tests.
This observation was somewhat confirmed by Crawford and Burn (1962), where E8 in situ
was estimated to be 4 to 13 times as large as that obtained from laboratory qu test plots and
about 1 to 1.5 times those obtained from triaxial U tests.
The in situ tests of SPT and CPT tend to use empirical correlations to obtain E8. Other
in situ tests such as the pressuremeter, the flat dilatometer, and the Iowa stepped blade tend
to obtain more direct measurements of Es. The value of stress-strain modulus Es obtained
from these tests is generally the horizontal value—but the vertical value is usually needed
for settlements. Most soils are anisotropic, so the horizontal Esh value may be considerably
different from the vertical value Esv? Overconsolidation may also alter the vertical and hor-
izontal values of stress-strain modulus.
Anisotropy, stress history, natural cementation, and overconsolidation are likely to be very
significant factors in determining E8, especially for cohesionless soils. In cohesionless soils
cementation is particularly significant; for individual soil grains the effect can be very small,
but the statistical accumulation for the mass can have a large effect. Cementation (also called
"aging") can be easily lost in recovered cohesionless samples. Drilling disturbances in co-
hesionless soils for the purpose of performing pressuremeter, dilatometer, or other tests may
sufficiently destroy the cementation/aging in the vicinity of the hole to reduce Es to little more
than an estimate.
Because the laboratory values of Es are expensive to obtain and are generally not very
good anyway owing to sampling disturbance, the standard penetration test (SPT) and cone
penetration test (CPT) have been widely used to obtain the stress-strain modulus Es result-
ing from empirical equations and/or correlations. Table 5-6 gives a number of equations for
possible use in several test methods. The value to use should be based on local experience
with that equation giving the best fit for that locality. Referring to Table 5-6, we can see that
a good estimate for the SPT is
E5 = C1(N + C2)
where values of C2 = 6 and 15 are shown and C\ ranges from 250 upward. This equation
can also be written (see again Table 5-6) as
E8 = C2 + C1N C2 = CiC2
For best results one should attempt to determine the C/ constants for the local area. The in-
crease for E8OCR using the multiplier VOCR seems to be reasonably valid (and substantially
used), although again local materials/practice might produce a slightly better multiplier.
For the CPT test the stress-strain modulus in Table 5-6 is of the general form
E8 = C3 + C4qc
where C3 ranges from O upward and Q may be one of the values also shown in Table 5-6.
Values of C3 = 0 and C4 = 2.5 to 3.0 for normally consolidated sands seem rather widely
used.

3 Always used as E

s in this text unless specifically noted otherwise.


A significant factor for the CPT is that there may be some critical depth below which the
cone resistance qc is nearly constant. This has a theoretical basis in that, below this depth, a
local bearing failure develops in a small zone around the tip of the cone. Obviously the soil
stiffens with depth (but not beyond bound). Depth increases may not be very large owing to
"local" failure around the cone tip. Thus, the use of an equation of the general form
E5 = C3 + Cretan"1 [^j
may be necessary to maintain reasonable values for E5 at the several depth increments z
through the test zone depth of D.
For this reason values of Es obtained using N values from the SPT may be more reliable
than those from the CPT. We also note that the cone test is essentially a measure of ultimate
bearing capacity on the cone tip (which has an area of only 10 cm2). This phenomenon is
illustrated on Figs. 3-14, 3-17, and in the cone data of Table P3-11, where nearly constant qc
values are shown at large D/B ratios. This observation means that one may not obtain very
good estimates of Es at depths beyond the critical depth (usually in the form of a depth ratio
such as 15 to 100 D/B)4 of the cone unless the overburden pressure over the depth of interest
is somehow included, perhaps by using a variable C5 ranging from 0 to 100 as follows:
C4 = (C5+fP'°) or C4 = C5+ log p'o
\ Po )
where p'o = the effective overburden pressure at the depth D (or D/B) of interest as previ-
ously defined in Chap. 2
n = exponent with a value usually ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 (but other values might
be used)
The Effect of the Overconsolidation Ratio (OCR) on Es
Table 5-6 gives the commonly used multiplier VOCR used to increase the normally con-
solidated value of stress-strain modulus Es>nc. By using the square root of OCR the effect is
certainly not so great as using OCR as the multiplier. When the soil is overconsolidated the
following occur:

1. The soil £"5,OCR should be larger than ESync. However, we are usually concerned with the
vertical value, so that the "OCR" value may not be much larger than the normally consol-
idated vertical value of Zs5.
2. If in situ tests are used, the horizontal value of Esh is obtained. For an overconsolidated
soil this value may be very much larger than the vertical value, but this estimate depends
heavily on how much soil disturbance (or lateral expansion) occurred when the hole was
drilled and/or test device inserted.
3. In overconsolidated soils if the soil is excavated (as for a large and/or deep basement) and
expands from loss of overburden, the resulting Es is smaller than before and may be very
much smaller, perhaps requiring a new test(s).

4Noting that the cone diameter B (= 35.6 mm) is not great, only a shallow depth D will produce a large D/B ratio
for a cone test.

4. It is not easy to determine if a cohesionless deposit is overconsolidated or what the OCR
might be. Cementation may be less difficult to discover, particularly if during drilling
or excavation sand "lumps" are present. Carefully done consolidation tests will aid in
obtaining the OCR of cohesive deposits as noted in Chap. 2.

In general, with an OCR > 1 you should carefully ascertain the site conditions that will
prevail at the time settlement becomes the design concern. This evaluation is, of course, true
for any site, but particularly so if OCR > 1.

5-9 SIZE EFFECTS ON SETTLEMENTS

5-9.1 Effects on Settlements
A major problem in foundation design is to proportion the footings and/or contact pressure so
that settlements between adjacent footings are nearly equal. Figure 5-9 illustrates the problem

Notes:
1. For qc generally use (2.5 to 3)qc for normally consolidated sand and about 4 to 6 qc for overconsolidated sand.
2. Can use Eqs, (a) and (b) above for all clay. They are particularly applicable for OCR > 1. Probably should use both Eqs. (a) and (c), and if
results differ significantly either use an average or compute another Es using a different equation.
3. For sands try to use more than one equation or else use one of the equations and compare the computed Es to published table (see Table 2-8)
values.
4. For silts use any of the above equations, but if the equations are given for sand use smaller coefficients.
5. For sand, using E5 = 250 or 500(N +15) may give a modulus that is too small (but conservative). Suggest when you use equations of this
form you compute E8 by one or more additional equations and average the results.
6. Note: Using VOCR is the same as (OCR)1^, so that exponent n = 0.5. You can use other values for the exponent from about 0.3 to 0.5.
However, since all the equations for E5 are approximations the use of n = 0.5 is sufficiently accurate unless you have good-quality field or
laboratory test values.


(and why plate load tests have little real value). It is evident that if the depth of influence is
H = 5B, a 0.3-m square plate has an influence depth of 5 X 0.3 = 1.5 m, whereas a 2-m
prototype would have a depth of 5 X 2 = 10 m. Considerable changes in the soil can occur
in that amount of depth increase.
To address this problem theoretically, let us rewrite Eq. (5.16a) [taking (1 - /JL2)/ES = E^]
as
AZZ1 = qolB[mIsl IFlE^ (a)
AZZ2 = q^2mU2lF2E[2 (b)

where qOi = base contact pressure (usually using the allowable bearing pressure qa)
B- = base widths as defined with Eq. (5-16a)
ISi = settlement influence factors based on H/B\ t and L'/B'
m = number of Z51- contributions, 1, 4, etc.
IFi = factors based on the DfB1 ratio
E'si = average stress-strain modulus over the effective depths H (= 5Z? or actual H
to hard stratum). In general, E'sl < E'sl for B'2 > B[ but the increase will not
usually be linear.

Dividing Eq. (b) by Eq. (a) we obtain
AZZ2 = qo2B±mIs2l_F2K2 (5 m
AZZ1 qo\B[mIsXIFXE'sl K }
This equation is as theoretically correct as the basic settlement equations. What has been done
in the past is this:

1. For clay soils assume constant E'si, IFi, and mlsi so that we have
^l = M^i (c)
which simplifies for constant contact pressure qo(= qo\ = qoi) to
AH2 = AH1(B^B1O (d)
This equation has been very widely used for clay soils. It simply states in equation
form that the settlement of a footing of width B2 is the settlement of a footing of width

Figure 5-9 Influence of footing size on the depth of the stress zone and Es. Note that, with an underlying stratum
of different soil, the plate settlement does not reflect stresses in this material; thus, the settlement of the full-size
footing can be seriously underestimated.

Strata boundary

Probable
in sand

Soil:


B\(= AZJi) times the ratio of the footing widths B2/B1. Experience indicates the use of
this approximation has been reasonably satisfactory.
2. For sand soils the same assumptions of constant values except for B[ were made but this
procedure did not predict very well. Multipliers were sought, and one of the most popular
[Terzaghi and Peck (1967), p. 489] was

Usually B [ was a load test plate of size 1X1 ft or 0.3 X 0.3 m and Bl1 was the prototype foot-
ing of dimension B. The influence of this equation can be seen with the bearing-capacity
equation [Eq. (4-12)]. This equation did not provide very good estimates, so another pro-
posal changes the AZZ1 multiplier to

( f - GiJ
where A1- = base areas and values of 0.4 to 0.7 are often suggested for the exponent n (0.5
is most common).
It should be evident that there is little chance of producing a reasonable multiplier—
particularly if the BjjB\ ratio is very large, as for using a 0.3-m square plate to extrapolate to
a 2- to 3-m square base (or to a 20- or 30-m square mat). The reason is that sand requires con-
finement to develop strength (or E8). If we assume that 75 mm (or 3 in.) around the perimeter
of any size plate provides the "confinement" to the interior sand, then only one-fourth of a
0.3-m square plate is effective. Thus, the apparent E8 is too small at the surface compared to
the prototype, which may be of size 2 X 2 m and which, with the edge loss, is about 93 per-
cent effective. Therefore, the E's2/E'sl ratio would be in error and the anticipated settlements
of the large plate B'2 too large (but conservative). A literature survey by the author indicates
that for large B'2/B[ ratios the increased settlement AZJ2 should not exceed about 1.6(AZJi)
or the reduced allowable bearing capacity qai should not be less than about 0Aqa\. For small
footing ratios of about 1.1 to 3 the settlement ratios should be about 1.1 to 1.2 and the pressure
ratios about 0.9 to 0.8.
For these reasons, and because Eq. (5-18) is theoretically exact, its use is recommended.

5-9.2 Effects on Bearing Capacity
Another use of Eq. (5-18) is for bearing capacity. Here we take AZJi = AZ/2 so settlements
are equal and replace qo\ = qa\\ qO2 = qai- Rearranging terms we obtain

««• ~ ^ E ^ h i ( 5 "1 9 )
The analogy of Eq. (e)9 taking settlement directly proportional to qa, gives
B2 + B1 \

The effect of base width was included in Eq. (4-12), somewhat similarly to Eq. (J). Equation
(J) tends to be too conservative—particularly for extrapolating plate-load tests to prototype


bases—and is not much used at present. The author recommends using Eq. (5-19) for theo-
retical accuracy, and the additional parameters seldom produce great difficulty because qa is
usually obtained from SPT or CPT data and it is a trivial exercise to obtain the stress-strain
modulus additionally from tables such as Table 5-6.

Example 5-9. The geotechnical consultant on a foundation project has obtained the soil data and
profile as shown on Fig. E5-9. A best average of Af values (they were nearly constant as in Fig.
P3-10) gave MJ0 = 20 shown. Column loads including dead and live loads are estimated in the
range of 450 to 900 kN (100 to 200 kips).

Figure E5-9

Required. Recommend qa for this project so that AH is limited to not over 25 mm.

Solution.
Stepl. Find a tentative f u s i n g Eq. (4-12). Convert N10 to N55, giving N55 = 20(70/55) = 25.45.
Use N55 = 25.
From Eq. (4-12),

B, m 1 + 0.33f qa, kPa (rounded)
1.2 1.33 650 [probably no B < 1.2 m]
2.0 1.25 515
3.0 1.17 440

The actual soil pressure q for the given range of column loads and for B = 1.5 m is from

900
to ^ = ___ ^4 OOkPa

Both of these soil pressures are much less than qa in the foregoing table. Tentatively recommend
qa = 250 kPa. The maximum allowable soil pressure, as an approximate average of the three table
values, is about 500 kPa (actual average = 535) with a maximum settlement AH ~ 25 mm.

Medium dense sand


Step 2. Check settlement for qa = 250 kPa.
B2qa = Pav
/450 + 900 ^ u
B ^ \ ~o—ocrT = 1-6 m as the average width B
For B = 1.6 X 1.6 m we have Z/fl = 1
* ' = ^ = 0 . 8 and g = ^ = 10 (or § = 5 )
From Table 5-2 at H/B' = 10 and L/B = 1 we obtain
Z1 = 0.498 I2 = 0.016 For sand, estimate /Lt = 0.3
/, = /i + ^ ^ / 2 /, = 0.498 + ^(0.016) = 0.507

From Fig. 5-7 at D/B = 1.5/1.6 = 0.94 we obtain IF = 0.65 (using program FFACTOR we obtain
0.66). From Table 5-6 we estimate Es for a normally consolidated sand as
Es = 500(N + 15) = 500(25 + 15) = 20000 kPa (note use of N55)
Using Es = 2600 Af, we write
Es = 2600 N = 2600(25) = 65 000 kPa (also Af55)
and if Es = 7000 VN, we have
Es = 7000 W = 7000 V25 = 35 000 kPa
From Table 2-7 the value of 20 MPa appears reasonable (and conservative). Substituting values into
Eq. (5-16«) with qa = qo, we have
A// = qoBt]--^mIslF
and, noting m = 4 for the center settlement we have

AH = 250(0.8) 4 ^ 7 ^ - ( 4 X 0.507)(0.65)(1000) = 12 mm

The factor 1000 converts A// in m to mm. For Es = 65 000,
AH = nl^)= 3.7 mm
\65/
Here we can also ratio qa (maximum qa ~ 500 kPa for AH = 25 mm) to obtain
A^L = 3Wd ^ A H = 25(250/500) = 12.5 mm
25 mm qa>max
It would appear that in the range of B = 1.5 to 2.5 m the settlements will be well under 25 mm
and differential settlements (difference in settlements between adjacent footings of different size)
will be acceptable. An "averaged" Es could have been used but was not needed as the minimum
value gives acceptable AH and great computational refinement is not needed at this preliminary
stage of design.
Recommend: qa = 250 kPa (about 5 ksf)
AH = under 25 mm


Example 5-10.

Given. Spread footings on an overconsolidated (or very heavily compacted) dune sand [D'Appolonia
et al. (1968) and in Table 5-3].

Required. Estimate the probable footing settlements.

Solution. From careful reading of the reference we obtain the average B = 12.5 ft and L/B = 1.6;
also /n = 0.33 was given.
From the boring log of Fig. 6 and soil profile of Fig. 2 of the reference we can estimate H = AB.
Also take AT55 = 25 as the estimated weighted average in depth H = AB, noting that borings
stopped at approximately #55 = 40 before the full depth of AB. From the data given the precon-
solidation was from dunes to elevations of 650 and 700 from the base elevations of 607 ft. Using
y = 0.110 kef and an average depth of 6 ft below footing base we can estimate the OCR at between
7 and 15. We will take OCR = 9 as a reasonable "average." The footing load qo at the time settle-
ment measurements were taken was approximately 3.4 ksf (about 55 percent of the design load).
Finally, the D/B ratio was given as 0.5 on average.
With these data we can proceed with a solution.

For H/B' = 2(AB)/B = 8 and L/B = 1.6 we obtain from Table 5-2
/1 = 0.573 and I2 = 0.031
Also for D/B = 0.5 we obtain IF = 0.75 from Fig. 5-7. Then
1 - 2CO ITl
Is = 0.573 + \ _ Q 3 3 | J (0.031) = 0.589
For Es use Table 5-5 with OCR = 9
E8 = 10(N + 15)OCR1/2 (obtain 10 = 500/50 for ksf)
E5 = 10(25 + 15)(9)1/2 = 1200 ksf
/12 S\/1 — 0 ^2 X
A// = 3.4 f — J/ 1 2 0 Q J(4 X 0.589)(0.75)(12) = 0.335 in.

The "measured" values as shown in Table 5-3 ranged from 0.3 to 0.4 inches.

Example 5-11. What is the expected corner settlement of the footing of Ex. 5-9?

Solution. For qa = 250 kPa = qo\ /JL = 0.3; E5 = 20000 kPa, and using the "average" B =
1.6 x 1.6 m of step 2, we have
D/B = 1.5/1.6 = 0.94 and IF = 0.65 (as before)
H/B' = H/B = 8/1.6 = 5 (withL/5 = 1)
using program FFACTOR, obtain
04
Z1 = 0.437 and I2 = 0.031 /, = 0.437 + ^-(0.031) = 0.455

Substituting into Eq. (5-16«) using B' = B for the corner and noting with a corner there is only one
contribution (m = 1), we obtain


AH = 250(1.6) f - ^ ^ Vl x 0.455)(0.65)(1000) = 5.4 mm

Observe that the corner settlement is not equal to the center settlement divided by four (12/4 =
3 mm < 5.4 mm computed here).

5-10 ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF COMPUTING
ELASTIC SETTLEMENTS
Since the elastic settlement is simply
rH n
A# = edh = V e ^

any method that accurately gives the strains in the identified influence depth H would give
an accurate evaluation of the settlement A//. As can be seen in Table 5-3 there is at present
no better procedure than that proposed using Eq. (5.16a); however, in foundation engineering
local practice sometimes prevails over any "best" method. For this reason the following two
alternatives are given—not as any author recommendation—so that the reader has familiarity
with the procedures.
One method is that proposed by Schmertmann (1970) wherein the change in the Boussi-
nesq pressure bulb was interpreted as related to the strain. Since the pressure bulb changes
more rapidly from about 0.4 to 0.6/?, this depth is interpreted to have the largest strains.
Schmertmann then proposed using a triangular relative-strain diagram to model this strain
distribution with ordinates of 0, 0.6, and 0 at OB, 0.5B, and 2B, respectively. The area of
the diagram is related to the settlement, and for constant Es, which is the same assumption
used to develop the strain profile, one may directly compute the settlement as the area of the
triangle X strain to obtain

Atf = 0.6B^- = 0.6Be (5-20)

Schmertmann also incorporated two correction factors for embedment depth and time as fol-
lows:
For embedment C\ = 1-0.5—^—z
Vo-q
For time C2 = 1 + 0.2 log —
where q and qo have been previously defined and t is time > 0.1 in years. With these correc-
tion factors Eq. (5-20) now is written as
AH = dC2(0.6B)e (5-2Oa)
If Es is not constant, Schmertmann proposed to plot the strain profile and obtain influence
factors Iz at the center of each change in Es over a depth increment Az to obtain
AH = C1C2Aq^ 1 ^ (5-20Z?)


This calculation would obviously give a conservative AH if Es is constant or increases with
depth. If lower layers have a much smaller Es the solution could give AH that is under-
predicted. With these two correction factors and Es — 2qc (using cone data), Schmertmann
computed a number of cases from the literature (some of which are used by the author in
Table 5-3) and obtained only fair agreement between computed and measured values of A//.
Another procedure is to use the stress path method of Sec. 2-13. In this method one per-
forms a series of triaxial tests at in situ CX0UC conditions and plots 2q = a\ — a^ versus
the strain e for points along the vertical center line of the foundation at depths of, say,
B/A, B/2, B, 1.5B, 2By 3B, and ABy or similar
Fewer tests can be used, but confinement {Koa\) is a significant parameter that has a
considerable effect on the strain e, requiring that enough tests be made in the upper depth of
z = 0 to AB to provide a reliable strain profile so one can use

AH = ^e1H1
i
This method requires careful construction of sand samples or use of good-quality "undis-
turbed" clay samples. It may give good results for normally consolidated sands but not for
overconsolidated and/or cemented sands because sample reconstruction will be impossible.
According to Lambe and Whitman (1979, p. 218) the settlement can be rather well predicted,
but their example used eight triaxial tests in a medium to fine sand that apparently was not
preconsolidated (K0 = 0.4) to find the displacement beneath a round tank. D'Appolonia et
al. (1968) in the overconsolidated dune sand (of Example 5-9) used this procedure with two
series of footings with seven triaxial tests each at the minimum and maximum estimated
OCRs on the site with only fair correlation.
Since we start the triaxial tests from in situ K0 consolidated conditions it is evident that
the triaxial test stress Ao-1 has a 1 : 1 correspondence to the footing stress Aq at that depth.
The Boussinesq method is commonly used to estimate Aq. Unless the stress path procedure is
perceived to give substantially better settlement estimates, its cost will be far out of proportion
to results because of the large number of triaxial tests required.

Example 5-12. Compute the immediate elastic settlement for the soil-footing system shown in Fig.
E5-\2a.
Preliminary work. A series of triaxial (or direct shear) tests must be run to establish </>. With <f>
the K0 soil pressure can be computed so that the triaxial tests are performed at that value of cell
pressure a3. Plot the initial part of the stress-strain curve to a large scale as shown in Fig. E5-12&.
For cyclic tests plot the last cycle and shift the ordinate so the curve passes through the origin. For
this example take
$ = 350 yx = 17.3 y2 = i9.i kN/m3
K0 = 1 - s i n 35° = 0.426
Use a single value of <f> even though it has been previously noted that <j> varies with soil density.
Test 1: po = 2(17.3) = 34.6 kPa a3 = 0.426(34.6) = 14.7 kPa
Use cell pressure = 20 kPa (approx. 3 psi)
Test 2: po = 3(17.3) + 1.5(19.1) = 80.6 kPa (estimating density)
Use cell pressure = 40 kPa


Figure E5-12

It is not a simple matter to test reliably at very low cell pressures. Usually it is not easy to build sand
samples to specific densities. At low cell pressures the vacuum used to hold the sample in place
until the cell pressure can be applied can "preconsolidate" the sample some amount. Probably three
or four tests would be better for this foundation but two are sufficient to illustrate the procedure.

At D/B = 0.0, AtT1 = qv(\ - K0) = 233.3(1 - 0.426) = 133.9 kPa. From the stress-strain plot
(curve 1) in Fig. E5-12&, we obtain ex = 7 X 10~3. The corresponding secant modulus E5 =

We can now compute the settlement using the stress path method by using the strains and the
contributory depths (from a depth plot not shown) as
AH = 0.75 m X 7.0 + 1.5 m X (4.6 + 1.8 + 1.0) + 0.75 m X 0.6 = 16.8 mm
We note that m X 1000 X 10"3 cancels, so this computation directly gives the settlement in mm.
For the secant modulus of elasticity method we will numerically integrate the modulus of elas-
ticity using Eq. (5-22) of Sec. 5-12 to find the average E5 as
E5 = ^- p 9 - 1 3 + 2 6 -8 + 20.4 + 24.5 + 25.3 W = 23.29 X 103 kPa
A similar computation for Ao-1 gives 59.525 (using Aa\ to be compatible with Es):
A " = ^ = ^ l r = 15-3 X I t ) -
m = 15.3 m m
This small discrepancy between the two methods is principally due to using the secant instead of
the tangent modulus of elasticity. How this compares with a field AH will depend on how realistic
K0 is compared to field lateral restraint beneath the base. If we used Eq. (5-Ia) to modify Es>tr (and
strain) both AH values would be reduced approximately 1/1.6 = 0.62 (10.4 and 9.5 mm).

5-11 STRESSES AND DISPLACEMENTS IN LAYERED
AND ANISOTROPIC SOILS
There are numerous elastic solutions for special cases of stresses and displacements in layered
or anisotropic soils. Special cases are sometimes useful to obtain an indication of probable
(or possible) magnitude of error from using an idealized soil mass (isotropic, homogeneous,
etc.). Generally, the special cases in the literature [Poulos and Davis (1974) summarize a large
amount of curves, charts, and tables] are not found in nature, or by the time the necessary
interpolations from curves and tables are made, the problem would be solved.
The author proposes that one of the best uses of the finite-element method (FEM) is to
solve this type of problem. A computer program FEM2D is noted on your program diskette.
One solves this type of problem as follows:

1. Model a reasonable size of half-space, once for all, and use a data generator to develop
the data to define the JC, y coordinates of the nodes and the node numbers defining each
element and the soil for that element. The model should have provision for about five
different layers of soil (for fewer layers one simply uses the same soil properties for more
than one layer).
2. Solve the problem for a point load at one node where the footing is placed and for a "one"
soil mass. This is either in the ground or at the ground surface (or both) depending on
whether it is desired to obtain depth effects.
3. Re-solve the problem with the point load at the same location but with the correct soil
stratification.
4. From the Boussinesq pressure bulbs obtain the stress at the desired point beneath the
footing (now we are incorporating the shape and three-dimensional effect of the load into
the problem).
5. From steps 2 and 3 find the point load stress at the same point as obtained in step 4.


6. Compute the stress due to stratification at any depth z as a proportion to obtain

qfL = qh{i) (5"21)
where qt = Boussinesq value for a footing of same dimension and applicable correc-
tions for depth, etc., in a homogeneous soil mass at the depth of interest
q/L = stresses due to footing in layered soil at the depth of interest
q?» <12 = stresses from the FEM solutions for the layered (step 3) and homoge-
neous (step 2) cases at the same depth of interest.
This solution is at least as good as the soil parameters E5 and /JL used in the FEM. This
method allows using a simpler two-dimensional plane-strain or plane-stress solution rather
than a much more complex three-dimensional analysis. Deflections can be computed in an
analogous manner.
Example 5-13.
Given. A 3.7 m wide X 24.4 m O.D. foundation ring as shown in Fig. E5-13<2. This example is
taken from Bhushan and Boniadi (1988) and some units have been converted to SI but the field

log is retained in the manner obtained and presented by them. Appropriate conversions to SI will
be made as necessary. The measured settlement during preload was 10 to 17 mm and the average
given by the reference was 15.2 mm.

Required. Estimate the settlement under the preload stress of 252.8 kPa given by the reference.
The preload stress is somewhat larger than the working load stress but will only be temporary.

Solution. We will use a modification of the method given by Bowles (1987) and in the previous
edition of this textbook.
Assumptions.

1. Take effective H = 5B' = 9.144 m, giving H/B' = 5.
2. Since a ring closes on itself an L value has no significance so use an approximate square as
shown by dashed lines on the ring in Fig. E5-13<2. This gives BXB = 3.658 X 3.658 m (B' =
1.829 m). If the inside diameter of the ring were smaller than 17.1 m we might be justified in
using B = outside diameter but not here.
3. From an inspection of the "typical" cone penetration resistance qc profile of Fig. E5-13& estimate
an "average" qc = 150 tsf, which converts to
qc,si = 150(2)(47.88) = 14364kPa
Then estimate E5 = 3qc since the zone of interest from - 6 ft to - 36 ft (1.83 to 11 m) for a depth
of 5B includes both clay and sand layers. This process gives

4. D/B = 1.82A66 = 0.5 (given, not an assumption).
5. I will use Eq. (5-16a) with /JL = 0.3 and with the Fox embedment reduction factor IF.
With these data and using program FFACTOR for D/B = 0.5, /i = 0.3, and L/B = 1, obtain
IF = 0.77 and the Steinbrenner influence factor Is = 0.455. One could also have used Table 1 of
Bowles (1987) for I5 and Table 5-7 for If. Making a direct substitution into Eq. (5-16a), we have
Atf = qBt{X~^ ^mUw (5-16)

= 252.8(1.83)(14^^)(4)(0.455)(0.77)(1000) = 13.4 mm
This result compares to the average Aif = 15.2 mm (0.6 in., and in the range of displacements)
reported in the reference. The reader should redo this example using Es = 2qc and also inspect Fig.
E5-13Z? and see if the author made a selection for the average qc = 150 tsf that is reasonable.

5-12 CONSOLIDATION SETTLEMENTS
The settlements of fine-grained, saturated cohesive soils will be time-dependent, and con-
solidation theory is usually used, although elastic methods can be, and sometimes are, used.
Equation (2-44) or (2-45) is usually used for consolidation settlements, however, the alternate
form given by Eq. (2-43) as
Atf = mvkpH = eH
is also used. Some authorities routinely use this latter equation format for settlement com-
putations both for clay and fine-to-medium sand since mv = \/Es (the constrained modulus
of elasticity) where mv is determined in a consolidation test. The sample, being on the order
of only 20 to 25 mm thick, may give results that are not very representative; and in sands,
the SPT or CPT is generally preferable since a large number of values can be obtained at
relatively low cost compared with the effort in a consolidation test—even if the loads can be
changed rapidly.
In applying consolidation theory to compute settlements in clay we have three factors to
consider:

1. Whether the soil is normally consolidated or preconsolidated (OCR > 1)
2. Estimating the in situ void ratio eo and obtaining sufficient compression indexes to profile
the clay layer(s) adequately
3. Estimating the average stress increase Lq in the stratum of thickness H

Section 2-10 has adequately considered what to do for preconsolidated strata. That section
also detailed obtaining eo and the compression indexes. Here we are primarily concerned
with practical application of the theory.
The in situ void ratio eo can usually be determined reasonably well using w^ and G5
and/or volumetric-gravimetric data from the soil sample in the consolidation ring used for
the test. It is usual to use values at the midheight of the consolidating layer, so if the consolida-
tion test sample were at a different location, the void ratio at midheight can be computed from


rearranging Eq. (2-42) and defining Ae = eo - e and p2 = p'o + Ap'o to obtain
e = eo-CclogBk±^
Po
where eo = void ratio test depth z
Po = y'z = effective overburden pressure at depth z
Ap'o = y'(dz) = increase or decrease in p'o from depth z
dz = depth from test depth z to midheight of stratum and may be (+) if below or
( - ) if above

It can be seen that the void ratio is not linear (and probably the compression indexes are not
either), so one should not use a very large stratum thickness H over which Aq, eo, and Cc are
averaged at H/2.
The average pressure increase in the stratum of thickness H from the foundation load can
be obtained by simply averaging the top and bottom value from Boussinesq theory for H
values up to about 1 m. For greater thickness one should use a numerical integration process.
The trapezoidal-rule formula is well suited for this (and other numerical integration) where a
depth (or space) increment Ah = constant is taken with end values p\, pn and interior points
at Ah spacing. This gives the area A of the pressure profile as

A = HAp = A h l ^ ^ + p2 + P3 + • • • + Pn-X\ (5-22)

from which the average pressure increase Ap in stratum thickness H is

It is, of course, necessary to compute p'o at the midheight of the layer as well. Where the
layer(s) are over about 2-m thick, one should give consideration to obtaining additional values
of Cc and eo so that the layer can be subdivided into layers of thickness Ht and the total
settlement computed as
n
AH = ^ T AHt
i
These additional values can result in a large number of computations, and it may be worth-
while to program the steps so that the work is semiautomated.
One may question the validity of using the Boussinesq method when the actual case is one
or more layers of clay soils with different Cc (or one or more layers of soils where immediate
settlements occur) overlying one or more consolidating clay layers. Although the method is
certainly not exact, unless there is a significant difference, say by a factor of five times or more
in the stress-strain modulus of the two materials, more refined computation will improve the
computed stress increase very little [see Morgan and Gerrard (1971)].

Example 5-14.

Given. The consolidation test, soil profile, and other data shown in Fig. E5-14. Note that original
data are given in Fps units and not converted, as emphasis is on procedures.


Figure E5-14

Required, Estimate the settlement of an 8 X 8 ft footing carrying 375 kips at elevation 353 ft on
the "soft to very soft brown silty clay" (elevation 347 ft to 337 ft).

Solution. Note that the author of this book estimated p'c using as a guide both the first and second
reload cycles since the e versus log p curve does not have a distinct "sharp-curved" portion. It is
possible that a better estimate might have been made using either Method 3 or Method 4 of Sec.
2-10.3. The Casagrande method would not be any better than the "eye" method used by the author
of this book, since a sharply curving part of the curve is not clearly identified. Even the "virgin"
curve part of this e versus log/? plot is somewhat curved, and the slope for computing Cc is some
approximate. With these comments we shall continue with a solution.
Estimate the initial (or in situ) void ratio eo. The value at the first plotted point (0.985) is high
since the soil has expanded from loss of overburden pressure. Obtain the value of 0.96 at the end
of the first rebound cycle as a better estimate. We will check this estimated e0, since the soil is
approximately saturated, using an equation from Chap. 2. This equation requires the specific gravity
Gs (estimated 2.70) and the natural water content (35.6% from Fig. E5-14<2):

eo = ^ ~ « 0.356(2.70) '= 0.961 (coincidence ??)

Compute the slope of the rebound curve Cr as a best estimate of the slope, which the user should
lightly pencil in but is not shown here, to obtain the void ratio values and pressure change. A better

task is left as a reader exercise.

illustrate alternative).
Compute Cc as the slope of the curve beyond p'c\ extend dashed line shown on Fig. E5-14« across

_ 1.00 - 0.68 _ 0.32 _

As a check use equations from Table 2-5:
Cc = 0.009(wL - 10) = 0.009(78 - 10) = 0.612 (a)
Cc = 031(eo + 0.003wL + 0.004w^ - 0.34)
= 0.37[0.96 + 0.003(78) + 0.004(35.6) - 0.34] = 0.37 (b)

Eq. (a) is probably in error because the soil is preconsolidated. Eq. (b) differs from the plot
value because of plot interpretation, but it is not a bad estimate, because it somewhat accounts for
preconsolidation by taking into account the liquid and natural water contents as well as the initial
void ratio.
Now find the average increase in stratum pressure Ap from base load [contact pressure qo =
375/(8 X 8) = 5.859 ksf (rather high)]:

1. Use the 2 : 1 method [see Eqs. (5-2a, b)]. With the footing at elevation 353, the depth to the top
of the clay layer is 353 - 347 = 6.0 ft; to the bottom, the depth is 353 - 337 = 16 ft. Thus,
f16 375 I 375 I16

Inserting the limits, we have

1 / 375 375 \ , ^ 1 r
Ap=T0{-~24+l4)=1'12ksi
2. Using the Boussinesq pressure bulbs (Fig. 5-4) and computer program SMBWVP we can con-
struct the following table:

Elevation, ft DIB Aq/qo Fig. 5-4 A^ A^* (SMBWVP)
-6.0 6/8 = 0.75 0.50 2.93 2.87
8.5 1.06 0.33 1.93 1.82
11.0 1.375 0.23 1.35 1.22
13.5 1.68 0.16 0.94 0.86
-16.0 2.00 0.12 0.70 0.64

Compute the average stress increase Ap( = Ag) using Eq. 5-22 and the computer-generated val-
ues (but the pressure bulb values are reasonable considering the small text scale—and probably


about as accurate):

A = AqH = 2.5 P ' 8 7 * ° ' 6 4 + 1.82 + 1.22 + 0.86^ = 14.14

with H = 10 ft; Ap = 14.14/10 = 1.41 ksf (pressure bulbs = 1.51)

Next find the effective overburden pressure at midheight of the consolidating stratum (refer to
Fig. E5-14&) referenced to the ground surface, not the footing base:
p'o = 0.110(363.0 - 349.5) = 1.485
+ (0.110 - 0.624)(349.5 - 342.0) = 0.356

Total effective pressure p'o = 1.841 ksf
From the e versus log p plot we obtain (method previously noted)
p'c = 1.5 tsf = 3.00ksf OCR = 3.00/1.84 = 1.6
and
p'o + A/? = 1.84 + 1.41 = 3.25 ksf
Ap2 = 0.25 ksf p'o = p'c = 3.00 ksf
Ap1 = 1.41 - 0 . 2 5 = 1.16 ksf p'o = 1.84 ksf Cc = Cr
Inserting values into Eqs. (2-45«), we have

AHtotal = 0.095 ft (0.095 X 12 « 1.14 in.)
This settlement is probably a little too large, and it is quite possible that the soil below elevation
337 ft ("stiff silty clay...") would contribute additional consolidation settlement. The contact pres-
sure qo = 5.86 ksf is rather high, and the base should probably be rechecked for settlement using
dimensions of either 9 X 9 or 10 X 10 ft.

5-12.1 Proportioning Footings for Equal
Consolidation Settlement
We considered the problem of sizing footings for equal immediate settlements in developing
Eq. (5-18). For footings located over a consolidating clay layer, finding the dimensions of
B X Lto obtain equal settlements becomes a trial procedure, as illustrated in the following
example.

Example 5-15. Proportion a footing such that the consolidation settlement is not over 40 mm for
the given conditions of Fig. E5-15#.

Solution. Assume that the net increase in soil pressure due to the concrete displacement of the soil
is negligible. Since the settlement depends on the contact pressure and footing size and is nonlinear,


<

several trials will be required, and it will be most convenient to use the average stress increase in
the stratum A/?. The results of A// versus B will be plotted to find the required footing size.

p'o = (3.0 + 1.2)(17.29) + ^ ( 1 8 . 8 6 - 9.807) = 93 kPa
Take Cc = 0.009(wL - 10) = 0.009(50 - 10) = 0.36 (but soil may have OCR > 1).
Also:

eo = wGs = -^T- (2.65) = 0.784 assuming S = 100 percent

Use the Boussinesq method (Fig. 5-4), and obtain data in Table E5-15.

Computing the average stress A/? by the trapezoidal rule [Eq. (5-22)], we find

Soft clay


Plotting these three points to obtain Fig. E5-15Z?, we can interpolate to obtain fi = 4m. Although
it might appear that B = 2, 3, and 4 m might be better trials, the best choices are not known initially
and larger values will more rapidly bracket B with at least as good accuracy as the known settlement
data. Note the nearly linear plot, which somewhat justifies Eq. (d) of Sec. 5-9.1.

It should be evident at this point that it is impossible to proportion footings so that the
settlements will be exactly equal unless the footings are the same size and with the same
contact pressure. The following points are important:
1. If the footings are of different size, and with the same contact pressure, the larger base
will settle more.
2. The stress profile is based on a depth of approximately 5/?, so clearly there is a greater
depth undergoing strain (and AH) for larger bases.
3. If the layer H is the same depth beneath two footings of qo = same but with different B,
the larger B will settle more, as there is a larger concentration of Boussinesq settlement
(the H/B is smaller for the larger footing). For immediate settlements the influence factor
is smaller but B' is larger.

5-12.2 Secondary Compression Settlements
In addition to the primary compression of a base as illustrated in Example 5-14, secondary
compression (or creep) also occurs. This phenomenon is associated with both immediate and
consolidation-type settlements, although it is usually not of much significance with immediate
settlements.
At least a part of the settlement causing the Leaning Tower of Pisa to tilt is probably due
to secondary compression, with consolidation providing the remainder of the vertical (and
differential) movement.
As previously stated in Chap. 2, secondary compression is the continuing readjustment of
the soil grains into a closer (or more dense) state under the compressive load. It occurs after
the excess pore pressure has dissipated and may continue for many years.
Secondary compression may be the larger component of settlement in some soils, par-
ticularly in soils with a large organic content. It can be estimated using Eq. (2-49) of Sec.
2-10.6.5 The major problem is obtaining the secondary compression index Ca of Eq. (2-49).

5Stinnette (1992) made an extensive study of organic soils in Florida (USA) and provided an extensive literature
survey. Both Eq. (2-49) and the methods of Tan et al. (1991) were shown to provide reasonable results but several
other methods were also given.


High-quality consolidation tests, if continued for a sufficient time for the appropriate load
increment, may give the best value. These are often not done and an estimated value is used,
either from one of the equations given in Table 2-5 or from a lesser-quality consolidation test
(if any are done).

Example 5-16.

Given, The data of Example 5-14 and a laboratory value of t\oo ~ 100 minutes (from a plot of A//
versus log time, not shown).

Required. Compute an estimate of secondary consolidation.

Solution. We will use the value from Table 2-5 of
CjCc = 0.032
and from Example 5-14 we have Cc = 0.32, giving
Ca = 0.032Cc = 0.032(0.32) = 0.010
Now we need some preliminary computations:

1. flab = 100 min. There are 24 X 60 X 365 = 525 600 min in 1 year.
2. Use the following:

Afield = Afield
'lab #,2 a b
This ratio is obtained from using Eq. (2-38), cancelling Ti and cv and using the appropriate
subscripts. The ratio is needed to estimate when secondary compression begins.
3. For a lab sample of //iab = 0.75/2 inches (two-way drainage) and a field //field = 10 ft = 120
inches (one-way drainage from inspection of boring log), the time for 100 percent consolidation
before secondary compression starts (using t^ = 100 min)—at least in theory—is
'field = 100(120/0.375)2 = 10 240 000 min
= 10240000/525 600 = 19.5 years

Using Eq. (2-49), we have

AH5 =HsCalogf±
h
and using /2 = 30 yr (arbitrary), t\ = 19.5 yr, and the consolidating layer as 10 ft (given), we have
an estimated secondary compression of
AH5 = 10(0.010)log(30/l9.5) = 0.019 ft = 0.23 in.
which is almost negligible.
It is very likely that the secondary compression will be larger than this, as some will occur
during primary consolidation. Theoretically, at the end of 19.5 years there is no excess pore pressure
anywhere in the 10-ft layer; however, during this time period dissipation occurs from the top down,
with secondary compression beginning before 19.5 years have elapsed in the upper regions. No
easily developed theory that is practical to use is currently available to take this into account. It is
therefore quite possible that there could be as much as 1 inch of secondary compression, and it could
occur well before the time when it is supposed to start, at 19.5 years.


This example and discussion, together with the observation that the consolidation settlement
from Example 5-14 is 1.14 in., indicates that there should be more than one consolidation test done
in this layer—that is, use at least two 5-foot-thick layers with a test in each. It also would be most
prudent to obtain samples and perform one or more additional tests within the 5B depth region that
penetrates into the "stiff silty clay" underlying this soft clay layer.
////

5-13 RELIABILITY OF SETTLEMENT COMPUTATIONS
Settlements are generally made up of immediate, consolidation, and secondary compression
(or creep) components as
AH = AH( + AHC + AHS
In cohesionless soils and unsaturated clays the immediate settlement predominates with per-
haps some creep AHs. The consolidation settlement predominates for saturated cohesive soils
unless the soil is very organic, in which case the creep term may predominate.
Immediate settlement computations can vary widely but as shown in Table 5-3 can, with
some care, be used to predict the settlement AH, quite satisfactorily.
Consolidation theory tends to predict the amount of settlement AHC rather well if care
is taken to obtain representative soil parameters. In most cases the settlement prediction is
conservative (i.e., is overpredicted) but within acceptable limits. A study of recent Geotech-
nical Division Journals and papers given at the ASCE conventions (too numerous to cite
specifically) gives an overview that consolidation settlements are adequately predicted. The
predictions are better for inorganic, insensitive clays than for others. The prediction requires
much care if the e versus log p curve is curved throughout or the clay is very sensitive. Much
care is also required if the clay is highly organic, as the creep component will be substantial.
The time rate for consolidation settlement is not well-predicted because the coefficient of
permeability is a significant factor. In the laboratory a thin sample with any compression un-
dergoes a large void ratio change relative to in situ. Since the coefficient of consolidation cv
depends on the void ratio [cv = f(e)], the laboratory value tends to be too small, so the time
for consolidation is overpredicted; e.g., based on a laboratory test to obtain cv, the field pre-
diction for a site is 6 years using Eq. (2-38), whereas actual measurements give about 3 years
for most of the settlement to occur. While overpredicted times are usually acceptable, there
will be cases in which, if the consolidation occurs too rapidly, the superstructure members
will crack rather than "creep" into a deformed position.

5-14 STRUCTURESONFILLS
It is often advantageous, and sometimes necessary, to place the structure or parts of it on
filled-in areas. These sites may be sanitary landfills, rubble dumps from demolished build-
ings, or fills constructed according to engineering criteria. In the situations where sanitary
fills or rubble dumps are used, it is doubtful that a structure can be placed on this material
and not undergo detrimental settlement unless the fill has had time to decompose and fully
consolidate. For most cases of foundations on fills the loads will have to be carried through the
fill material utilizing piles or caissons of a noncorrosive material (usually concrete or treated
wood).


A well-constructed earth fill, using quality control with regard to both material and com-
paction, often produces a better foundation base than the original material underlying the fill.
Many persons have been reluctant to place a footing on or in fills because of two main factors:

1. Unpleasant results from placing footings on poorly placed fills. With no quality control it
is not unusual to get a fill with a hard crust over 0.5 to 1 or more meters of loose fill, as
a result of compacting only the last lift, or from placing a lift too thick to be compacted
with the available equipment.
2. Placing a footing in the fill with unpleasant results obtained not from the fill settlement but
from settlement of the underlying soil due to the weight of both the fill and the structure.

There are precautions one must take with a fill, in addition to exercising compaction con-
trol, such as eliminating soils of large volume change; providing adequate drainage; and, if
construction is to proceed relatively soon after the fill is placed, making sure that consolida-
tion settlements have been considered. Under consolidation processes the structure and fill
will subside from the weight of the fill alone; and this will take place whether the footings
are placed on the natural soil or in the fill. Excessive differential settlements may also result
from consolidation in the underlying soft strata if the fill varies considerably in thickness and
particularly if part of the structure is on an excavation or virgin soil and part is on fill. A poorly
constructed fill will also undergo settlements with time, and there is no theory available that
can be used to estimate the amount of or the length of time for the settlement to be completed.
The determination of the bearing capacity (and settlements) proceeds as with the virgin
soil. If the fill is placed before exploration takes place, the usual exploration methods of
Chap. 3 (standard penetration tests on recovered samples) are applicable. When the field
exploration has already been performed, the bearing capacity of the fill may be determined by
performing laboratory tests on specimens compacted to the proposed in situ density. Building
code values, coupled with successful experience on soils of similar properties and density,
may also be used as a guide.

5-15 STRUCTURAL TOLERANCE TO SETTLEMENT
AND DIFFERENTIAL SETTLEMENTS
Theoretical settlements can be computed for various points such as corner, center, or beneath
the lightest- and heaviest-loaded footings to obtain the total settlement and the differential
settlement between adjacent points. If the entire structure moves vertically some amount or
rotates as a plane rigid body, this movement will not generally cause structural or architec-
tural distress. For example, if a structure settles 20 mm on one side and 100 mm on the other
with a linear settlement variation between the two points, structural damage is not likely
to develop, although there are aesthetic and public confidence considerations. The building
will have settled 20 mm and tilted an amount f = (100 - 20)/L. Local settlements below
the tilt line between the two sides of the structure will be the cause of any building distress.
These local settlements below either the settlement or tilt line are the differential settlements
that the foundation designer must control, since they will determine the acceptability of the
structure. The initial settlements that occur during construction (or shortly after) can usually

be landscaped into concealment when the building is completed or later. A cracked wall or
warped roof is much more difficult to conceal.
Differential settlement can be computed as the difference in settlement between two adja-
cent points. It may be estimated as three-fourths of the computed maximum total settlement;
i.e., maximum total settlement = 40 mm; expected differential settlement, A/z = |(40) =
30 mm.
MacDonald and Skempton (1955) made a study of 98 buildings, mostly older structures of
load-bearing wall, steel, and reinforced concrete construction to provide the data of Table 5-7.
This study was substantiated by Grant et al. (1974) from a study of 95 additional buildings
of more recent construction (some were constructed after 1950). FeId (1965) cited a rather
large number of specific structures with given amounts of settlement and structural response,
which might be of interest in considering a specific problem. Combining all sources, one can
conclude [see Wahls (1981)] that

1. The values in Table 5-7 should be adequate most of the time. The values in brackets
are recommended for design; others are the range of settlements found for satisfactory
structural performance.
2. One must carefully look at the differential movement between two adjacent points in as-
sessing what constitutes an acceptable slope.
3. Residual stresses in the structure may be important, as it has been observed that there is a
range of tolerable differential settlements between similar buildings.
4. Construction materials that are more ductile—for example, steel—can tolerate larger
movements than either concrete or load-bearing masonry walls.
5. Time interval during which settlement occurs can be important—long time spans allow
the structure to adjust and better resist differential movement.

If computed differential settlements are kept within the values in parentheses in Table
5-7, statistically the structure should adequately resist that deformation. Values of acceptable
slopes between two adjacent points from the U.S.S.R. building code are in Table 5-8.
One might use the following, a composite from several sources, as a guide in estimat-
ing differential settlement. Define L = column spacing and S = differential displacement

5-16 GENERAL COMMENTS ON SETTLEMENTS
It is a rare event when footings all settle the amount computed by the designer. This is true for
footings on sand, on slopes, or on sand and clay where there is a combination of immediate
and long-term consolidation settlements.


Soil is too heterogeneous to make settlement predictions with any great accuracy. What is
hoped is to design site footings with a 95 to 98 percent reliability such that any given footing
settlement is within about ± 20 percent of some amount considered tolerable for that structure.
It is preferable that settlements all be within less than 20 percent.
Using simple statistics and assuming the work has been reasonably done, if there are 20
to 25 footings in an area, the average settlement will probably be within about ±20 percent
(taken as the standard deviation) of the computed value, but there will be at least one whose
settlement is about twice as large as the smallest settlement, thus establishing the extremes.
For this ±20 percent settlement range to occur it is necessary to use representative soil
properties from the given site. Statistics may be employed to obtain the most probable value.
There are a number of statistical procedures given in the literature, but most use symbols and
terminology not familiar to engineers, causing them to underutilize these methods. The statis-
tical methods of simple averaging or weighted averaging are easy to apply but are somewhat
time-consuming.
Finally, field construction methods may be significant in the settlement outcome. For ex-
ample, most footings require some soil excavation. If the soil is freestanding, the footing
perimeter is often excavated slightly larger so that mechanical excavation equipment can be
used, but the excavated pit walls serve as forms. If the soil is not free standing, excess perime-
ter excavation is required so that the footing forms can be set. In either case the soil beneath
the footing must be recompacted. Depending on the compactor and amount of compaction,
the soil state can be changed significantly (increase in density, apparent overconsolidation,
stiffness, etc.). These state changes can substantially reduce the settlements, particularly on
sand. On the other hand, if there is no compaction before the base is placed, the settlements
can greatly exceed the computed values.

CHAPTER
6
IMPROVING SITE SOILS
FOR FOUNDATION USE

6-1 INTRODUCTION
The centuries-old problem of land scarcity in the vicinity of existing urban areas often ne-
cessitates the use of sites with soils of marginal quality. In many cases these sites can be
utilized for the proposed project by using some kind of soil improvement. This chapter will
focus on several of the more widely used methods of improving soils for bearing capacity. An
extremely large number of methods have been used and/or reported in the literature—many
of which have been patented—and at an individual site one may use a mix of several methods
to achieve the desired result. Chapter 12 will consider methods for increasing lateral stability.
For a given site a first step is to make a literature review of at least some of the methods
reported. This together with a reasonable knowledge of geotechnical fundamentals allows the
engineer to use either an existing method, a mix of methods, or some method coupled with
modest ingenuity (unless limited by a governmental agency) to produce an adequate solution
for almost any site.
Of principal interest in this chapter is the identification of means to obtain a significant
increase in the bearing capacity of a soil. This can be achieved by altering the soil properties
of <£, cohesion c, or density p. Usually an increase in density (or unit weight y) is accompa-
nied by an increase in either cf> or c or both (assuming the soil is cohesive). Particle packing
(compaction) always increases the density, with a resulting decrease in void ratio, and re-
duces long-term settlements. Particle packing usually increases the stress-strain modulus so
that any "immediate" settlements are also reduced.
The rest of this section considers approaches to soil property modification.

Mechanical stabilization. In this method the grain size gradation of the site soil is al-
tered. Where the site soil is predominantly gravel (say, from 75 mm down to 1 mm) binder ma-
terial is added. Binder is defined as material passing either the No. 40 (0.425 mm) or No. 100


(0.150 mm) sieve. The binder is used to fill the voids and usually adds mass cohesion. Where
the soil is predominantly cohesive (No. 40 and smaller sieve size) granular soil is imported
and blended with the site soil.
In either case the amount of improvement is usually determined by trial, and experience
shows that the best improvement results when the binder (or filler) occupies between 75
and 90 percent of the voids of the coarse material. It usually requires much more granular
materials to stabilize cohesive deposits than binder for cohesionless deposits and as a result
other stabilizing methods are usually used for clayey soils.
Compaction. This method is usually the most economical means to achieve particle pack-
ing for both cohesionless and cohesive soils and usually uses some kind of rolling equipment.
Dynamic compaction is a special type of compaction consisting of dropping heavy weights
on the soil.
Preloading. This step is taken primarily to reduce future settlement but may also be used
to increase shear strength. It is usually used in combination with drainage.
Drainage. This method is undertaken to remove soil water and to speed up settlements
under preloading. It may also increase shear strength since su, in particular, depends on water
content. For example, consolidation without drainage may take several years to occur whereas
with drainage facilities installed the consolidation may occur in 6 to 12 months.
Densification using vibratory equipment. Densification is particularly useful in sand,
silty sand, and gravelly sand deposits with Dr less than about 50 to 60 percent. This method
uses some type of vibrating probe, which is inserted into the soil mass and withdrawn. Quality
fill is added to the site to bring the soil surface to the required grade since the site soil usually
settles around and in the vicinity of the vibrating probe.
Use of in situ reinforcement. This approach is used with stone, sand, cement, or lime
columns. This treatment produces what is sometimes called composite ground. Sometimes
small amounts of short lengths of plastic fibers or fiberglass can be mixed with the soil for
strength improvement. The major precaution is to use a fiber material that has an adequate
durability in the hostile soil environment.
Grouting. Initially this was the name for injection of a viscous fluid to reduce the void
ratio (and k) or to cement rock cracks [see ASCE (1962)]. Currently this term is loosely used
to describe a number of processes to improve certain soil properties by injection of a viscous
fluid, sometimes mixed with a volume of soil. Most commonly, the viscous fluid is a mix of
water and cement or water and lime, and/or with additives such as fine sand, bentonite clay,
or fly ash.1 Bitumen and certain chemicals are also sometimes used. Additives are used either
to reduce costs or to enhance certain desired effects. Since the term grout is so loosely used
in construction, the context of usage is important to define the process.
Use of geotextiles. These function primarily as reinforcement but sometimes in other
beneficial modes.
Chemical stabilization. This means of stiffening soil is seldom employed because of
cost. The use of chemical stabilizers is also termed chemical grouting. The more commonly
used chemical agents are phosphoric acid, calcium chloride, and sodium silicate (or water

glass). Some laboratory tests indicate certain metallic powders (aluminum, iron) may produce
beneficial effects as well [Hoshiya and Mandal (1984)]. ASCE (1957,1966) cited usage of an
extremely large number of chemical grouting procedures (mostly patented, but most of the
patents have probably expired by now).
Strictly, soil-cement and lime-soil treatment (often together with fly ash and/or sand) is a
chemical stabilization treatment, but it is usually classified separately.

Several of the foregoing methods of soil improvement will be taken up in additional detail
in the following sections. The primary emphasis, however, is on improving soils for use in
building foundations. Additional background on the preceding methods may be obtained from
the three ASCE conferences on "Soil Improvement," the latest being published by ASCE as
Geotechnical Special Publication No. 12 (1987).
Appropriate references will be cited so the interested reader may obtain additional depth
for a particular application.

6-2 LIGHTWEIGHT AND STRUCTURAL FILLS
A method that allows construction of relatively light structures (such as residences and one-
or two-story structures with lightly loaded foundation slabs) on very soft base soil is to use
either a lightweight fill or a carefully placed structural fill onto which the foundation is placed.
Lightweight fills may use expanded shale, certain industrial slags, and fly ash. A reduction
in y from 18.5 to 16.5 kN/m3 in a fill 1 m thick allows a 2 kPa foundation load increase for
the same contact pressure of 18.5 kPa. These materials may be mixed with sand and/or gravel
to produce a fill of the desired density and durability.
There are two "soft soil" cases to consider:

1. The site soil has such an extremely low shear strength that any surface load produces a
shear failure (sinks into the mud). In this case it will be necessary to pretreat a surface
thickness on the order of 15O+ mm by sand (or a sand-gravel mixture) that is mixed with
the top soil to produce a final mix with some load-supporting capacity.
2. The site soil has sufficient shear strength that it can support small surface loads.

For either of these cases a support fill is first placed by spreading imported fill to a loose
depth between 0.5 and 1 m from hauling equipment as it is backed onto the site. Care is used
that the soil underlying the fill is not much rutted in this operation. That is, the imported fill
provides the necessary spreading of the hauler wheel loads to a pressure the underlying soil
can support.
Lightweight or small spreaders are then used to bring the fill to the desired depth with
minimal damage to the underlying soft base soil. Compaction is done with light- to medium-
weight rollers once the layer (usually called lift) thickness is sufficient that the equipment
weight does not cause the underlying soil to fail.
Construction of the building commences after the desired settlement has occurred under
the preload of the fill. Vertical drains and a sand blanket beneath the fill may be used to speed
consolidation. Fill thicknesses range from about 0.5 m to 1+ m.
Fills may be the most economical site improvement method available when used in con-
junction with careful monitoring of the field work for floor slab-type buildings.


This method was used for a housing site near San Francisco on bay mud with an su on
the order of 15 to 25 kPa [Garbe and Tsai (1972)]. With a compacted fill of about 0.6 m
the preload pressure on the underlying mud was on the order of 10 to 14 kPa. With the fill
in place about 12 months prior to erecting the houses (using slabs on grade—no basements
obviously), the soil consolidated sufficiently that the increase in su could carry the building
foundations and access roads.
Preloading, however, may not always produce a successful outcome. Duncan (1993—but
see also "discussion" in 1995) described another housing development in the San Francisco
Bay area where the outcome was rather uncertain. After about 12 years of preloading there
was an estimate that subsequent differential settlement over a 23-m distance could approach
100 mm. The developer was required to provide an escrow account should later settlements
require housing repairs.
Foundation loads from residential buildings are seldom over 15 to 20 kPa for wall footings
and perhaps one-tenth of this for slabs on grade. Service roads should be of asphalt to allow
deformation with minimal cracking and to allow repaving of bumps and potholes at minimum
cost. It would also be necessary to stipulate a maximum truck load to avoid rutting.

6-3 COMPACTION
Compaction is usually an economical method of improving the bearing capacity of site soils.
It may be accomplished by excavating to some depth, then carefully backfilling in controlled
lift thicknesses, each of which is compacted with the appropriate compaction equipment. The
backfill soil may be the excavated soil dried (or wetted) as necessary, possibly mixed with an
admixture such as cement or lime, with or without fly ash or sand filler; or it may be imported
soil from a nearby borrow pit. The standard compaction tests (ASTM, vol. 4.08) that may be
used to establish the field density are these:

ASTM D 698 ASTM D 1557 (Modified)

24.4-N (5.5-lb) rammer 44.5-N (10-lb) rammer
305-mm (12-in.) drop 457-mm (18-in.) drop
944 cm3 (1/30 ft3) mold*
3 layers of soil 5 layers of soil
25 blows/layer 15 blows/layer
*Mold diameter = 101.6 mm for Methods A and B or 152.4 mm for
Method C, which allows particles larger than 20 mm (3/4 in.).

The foregoing procedures are for ASTM test Methods A and B, which are for soil with
grains smaller than 10 mm ( | in. nominal). Refer to the ASTM test Method C if larger soil
particles are used.
The modified compaction test (D 1557) just listed is not used much in building construction
since there is seldom enough soil improvement to justify the additional compaction effort
and necessary quality control. Figure 6-1 presents typical compaction curves for several soils
obtained using Method A from both ASTM standards.
For fills that will later support any structure it is usual to perform compaction tests to
establish the required compacted density and optimum moisture content (OMC) for the field

soil. Field density tests (quality control) are then performed to ensure the desired unit weight
y is obtained. With compaction control, the fill is often of better quality than the underlying
soil. The underlying soil will undergo settlements of varying magnitude depending on its
characteristics and the depth of fill Dan which produces a settlement/consolidation pressure
of y Aiii-
Settlements will be nonuniform if the fill depth varies or if the site consists of both cut
and fill. Settlements may be of long duration unless special steps are taken to speed up the
process such as overfill (or preloading) to increase the settlement pressure and/or installation
of drainage to speed consolidation.
Compaction of cohesive soils can be accomplished using sheeps-foot or rubber-tired
rollers. Lifts are commonly 150 to 200 mm thick. It may be necessary either to aerate the soil
by disking to reduce the water content or to add water from mobile water tanks if the field
WJM is too low. Minimum compaction effort is required when the field w^ is near (or at) the
OMC.
Compaction of cohesionless soils can be accomplished using smooth wheel rollers, com-
monly with a vibratory device inside, so the compaction is a combination of confinement,
pressure, and vibration. Lift depths up to about 1.5 to 2 m can be compacted with this

equipment. Better results are obtained, however, for lift thicknesses of 0.6 to 1 m. Where
there is an ample supply of water and its use does not adversely affect the surrounding soil,
flooding (100 percent saturation) will substantially reduce the required compaction effort—
particularly if the in situ sand is slightly damp where surface tension impedes densification.
In confined spaces, it is necessary to use hand-powered equipment for compacting the
soil. This requirement reduces the lift thickness so that if density has been specified, lift
thicknesses should not exceed 75 to 100 mm. For lifts that are too thick, compacting by
hand—or any method—results in a dense upper crust overlying uncompacted soil which will
later settle under self-weight and/or applied load, regardless of the type of equipment used
or soil location.
Specific details of compaction methods and equipment necessary to compact various soils,
laboratory tests to establish compaction specifications, and field tests for verification are be-
yond the scope of the overview presented here. The interested reader may wish to consult

Although these references are somewhat dated, this soil improvement method was one of the
earliest that was heavily researched. There is little that can be added to the current knowledge
base.
The bottom of any footing trench or basement excavation should always be compacted
either using hand or full-size equipment. Although this precaution does not recover heave
(expansion due to loss of overburden) it does place the base soil loosened by the excavation
equipment into a dense state.

6-3,1 Consolidation Settlements of Compacted Fill
Early geotechnical engineers knew that a compacted fill would undergo some subsidence due
to self-weight producing grain readjustment and/or some squeezing (or creep). Any consoli-
dation settlements were supposed to be developed in the underlying soil supporting the fill.
It is now known that both the underlying soil and the compacted fill undergo consolidation.
The consolidation of the underlying soil is similar to that described in Sees. 2-10 and 5-12.
Fill settlements can range from about 60 mm to well over 500 mm depending on the depth
and the following factors:

1. Soil fabric (how much particle packing, type of particles, etc.); related to the compaction
effort.


2. The compaction water content, and later change in water content. Factors 1 and 2 are, of
course, related.
3. The fill height (or depth for a self-weight component) and any surcharge or applied vertical
stress as from a foundation.

The fill consolidation usually involves later mass saturation and may occur a number of
years after construction. After a long period of time the vertical movements may not always
be correctly attributed to consolidation settlement within the fill.
It appears that one might estimate the probable consolidation settlement in the fill by com-
pacting soil samples in the laboratory to the field density and field compaction water content.
These samples can then be put into a consolidation test device, saturated, and then tested
for swell and for both primary and secondary compression. It may be necessary to use back-
pressure to speed the saturation process if the consolidation device allows it. Some of this
methodology is described by Brandon et al. (1990) and Lawton et al. (1989).

6-3.2 Dynamic Compaction
A widely used method of compaction using a mobile crane to lift and drop a heavy tamper
onto the soil is called dynamic compaction (some persons call the procedure dynamic consoli-
dation). Although the dropping of a weight on the soil had probably been in use for centuries,
it was reintroduced to the profession and patented by L. Menard in France ca. 1970 [see
Menard and Broise (1975)]. Compaction can be achieved to a substantial depth depending
on weight (or mass) of the tamper, height of fall, and the type of soil.
Although the dynamic compaction tamper can have a mass up to 150,000 kg (or 150
tonnes), the usual mass is on the order of 10 to 20 tonnes and is dropped from heights ranging
up to 40 m (usually 10 to 20 m) onto a grid spacing so that the site requiring improvement
is adequately covered. Craters ranging from 0.5 to 2 m in depth are produced at the points of
impact.
After a selected part of the area to be compacted is covered by a pass (drop in each grid
point) it is graded with a bulldozer using imported fill as necessary to smooth the surface, the
next pass is made, and so on until the desired density is obtained. Density is usually specified
based on before and after penetration tests (either SPT or CPT). After the site improvement is
completed, the area is brought to grade and compacted with ordinary compaction equipment.
Most saturated soils that can be classified through silty and/or clay sands and gravels can
be considerably improved by this method. The amount of compaction tends to decrease with
an increase in silt or clay content. Saturated clays tend toward almost no improvement be-
cause the impact results in an instantaneously high pore pressure, an immediate loss of shear
strength, and remolding. Partially saturated clays may be improved, at least in the region
above the GWT.
In practice several trial grid sections are used to determine the optimum drop spacing, drop
weight (and/or height of fall), and number of drops.
For cohesionless soils Leonards et al. (1980) suggested the depth of compaction influence
Di is approximately

(6-1)


In cohesive soils Menard and Broise (1975) suggested
D1 = JWh (m) (6-2)

where W = mass of tamper in tonnes (1 tonne = 1000 kg)
h = height of fall, m

Both of these equations are in current use.
Mayne et al. (1984) give a review of a large number of sites where dynamic compaction
was used; Rollins and Rogers (1991) present a more recent example of the method for a
collapsible alluvial soil. See Greenwood and Thomson (1984) for additional dynamic com-
paction details if necessary.
It is evident that the improvement will range in quality from the point of impact and grade
into untreated soil at the depth D1-. The depth D1- should be on the order of IB of the least lateral
foundation dimension for smaller bases, but engineering judgment and available equipment
will determine the influence depth D1 for large bases such as mats that cover large foundation
areas. Grid spacings are commonly on the order of 1.5 to 4 meters.
Ordinarily, dynamic compaction/consolidation is only economical when
1. Site plan involves an area of some 5000 to 10 000 m2.
2. Depth of soil is too great to use excavation and replacement.
3. Impact vibrations that are on the order of 2 to 12 Hz will not cause damage to nearby
developments.

Where the water table is near the ground surface or there is a soft clay surface deposit, it may
be necessary first to lay a free-draining granular blanket on the order of 200 to 1000 mm thick
over the area to be dynamically compacted.

6-4 SOIL-CEMENT, LIME, AND FLY ASH
In many cases where slab-on-grade construction is to be used the most economical solution
to increase the bearing capacity may be to do one of two things.

1. Use soil-cement, with or without a sand or fly ash filler. In this procedure soil samples are
mixed with varying percentages of cement and/or sand and/or fly ash, cured in a manner
somewhat similar to concrete control test cylinders,2 and tested to obtain the unconfined
compression strength qu. That mix providing the required strength becomes the job mix.
The cement and/or other admixtures are either deposited on the soil and thoroughly mixed
at the necessary water content with discs and similar farm equipment or run through a
traveling soil processor where the chemicals and water are added, blended and redeposited
on the soil for grading and compaction. Depths to about 1.5 m can be treated in this manner;

2ASTM has a number of standards relating to "soil-cement".


greater depths usually require some alternative method. The required cement by weight
is seldom over 5 percent.
2. Use lime or a mix of lime and sand, with or without fly ash, in a manner similar to soil-
cement.

6-5 PRECOMPRESSION TO IMPROVE SITE SOILS
A relatively inexpensive, effective method to improve poor foundation soils in advance of
construction of permanent facilities is preloading. The preload may consist of soil, sand, or
gravel; and in the case of oil or water tanks, gradual filling of the tanks may be used for the
preload. Sometimes the preload may be accomplished by lowering the groundwater table.
It may also be accomplished by "ponding," that is, building a watertight containment that
is filled with water [but requires protection against vandalism and unauthorized recreation
(such as swimming)].
How or what to use to accomplish preloading will be determined by relative economics.
Aldrich (1965) [see also Johnson (1970)] conducted a survey among several organizations to
produce a report on preload practices that were current at that time.
Precompression (or preloading) accomplishes two major goals:
1. Temporary surcharge loads are used to eliminate settlements that would otherwise occur
after the structure is completed.
2. Preloading improves the shear strength of the subsoil by increasing the density, reducing
the void ratio, and decreasing the natural water content WN-
Preloading is most effective on normal to lightly overconsolidated silts, clays, and organic
deposits. If the deposits are thick and do not have alternating sand seams, the preloading may
necessitate using sand drains (see Sec. 6-6) to reduce the time necessary to effect consolida-
tion.
The amount of settlement eliminated by using preloading should be 1OO percent of primary
consolidation. As much secondary compression is removed as practical so that, in combina-
tion with the eliminated settlement, any remaining after project completion will be tolera-
ble. The primary consolidation can be computed by obtaining the stress increase using the
Boussinesq method of Chap. 5 for several points beneath the loaded area and using Eq. (2-
44). The secondary compression may be estimated using Eq. (2-49) repeated here, expanded,
and terms reidentified to obtain

AHS = ^-log^I^ (6-3)
1 + e0 U
where AHs = secondary compression settlement, in units of H
H = thickness of stratum in field, m
Ca — coefficient of secondary compression
tf = time of interest when AHS occurs, days or years
U = time at the end of primary consolidation or slightly later, days or years.
The total settlement for the preload is the sum of the primary and secondary settlements [the
sum of Eqs. (2-44) and (6-3)].


Shear strength tests before and after preloading are necessary to evaluate the improvement
in strength with preconsolidation. These are best run on undisturbed tube samples in either
unconfined or triaxial tests. The in situ vane may not give much indication of any shear
strength improvement, for the vane measures horizontal rather than vertical shear strengths.
Since the lateral improvement is likely to be on the order of Kcrv, with K usually less than 0.5,
preload improvement that may be sufficient for vertical loads may be too small to be detected
by the shear vane test with sufficient accuracy or reliability to be of value [Law (1979)].
Normally the preload surcharge would be greater than the estimated weight of the proposed
structure so that postconstruction settlements are negligible. There may be some rebound and
recompression as any preload is removed and before the building load is applied.
Preloading does not seem to be much used at present since a number of other procedures
can be used to improve the soil that are comparable in cost, allow more rapid access to the
site, and do not require disposal of the excess preload material.
In extremely soft cohesive and peaty deposits such as glacial lakes, river deltas, and peat
bogs a procedure called displacement preloading may be used where haulers back to the site
edge and dump the quality fill. The fill load induces a shear failure in the in situ soil, which
causes it to displace laterally away from the fill. The lateral displacement usually produces
viscous waves in the soil called mud waves. When there is enough fill accumulated it is
compacted and the process continued until the desired area is stabilized. This procedure is
of use for shoreline construction and has been used to produce causeways across lakes for
railroad tracks and roadways.

6-6 DRAINAGE USING SAND BLANKETS AND DRAINS
When either a fill or a soil preload is placed on a saturated cohesive deposit, the length of
the drainage path may be increased—perhaps to the top of the fill. Since the length of the
drainage path determines the time for consolidation, this should be as short as possible.
When the water table is very near the ground surface, either the site should be graded so it
slopes to one side or a series of shallow collection ditches should be cut. Next a layer of sand
(called a sand blanket) 100 to 150 mm thick is placed on top of the site and in the drainage
ditches, and then the preload. Water squeezed from the soil being consolidated then flows up
to the ditches or sand blanket and drains to the edge for disposal. This will greatly speed the
drainage process, since the coefficient of permeability is larger in sand.

6-6.1 Sand Drains
We can extend this concept further and install vertical columns of sand at selected intervals
in the existing soil. Under the hydraulic gradient produced by the fill (or preload) the water
flows from a higher to a lower energy potential. Since the water can move faster through the
sand than through the in situ soil, the sand columns (sand drains) become points of low energy
potential.
Maximum flow rate is obtained by incorporating a sand blanket with the sand drains. Sand
drains can be installed even where the consolidating stratum is some depth below the surface
to speed up the consolidating process. Here, however, it may not be desirable or necessary to
use a sand blanket.


Consolidation theory of Sec. 2-10 is the basis for both sand blankets and sand drains. The
time tc for consolidation is estimated from a rearrangement of Eq. (2-38) to obtain
TH2
tc=l-f- (6-4)
The dimensionless factor T depends on the percent consolidation U (see Table 2-4) and is
about 0.848 and 0.197 for 90 and 50 percent consolidation, respectively. The coefficient of
consolidation cv is usually back-computed from a consolidation test by solving Eq. (6-4) for
cv. The coefficient is also

cv = - ^ - (2-35)
ywmv
where all terms have been defined in Chap. 2. For radial drainage as in sand drains, the
coefficient of permeability (or hydraulic conductivity) k in Eq. (2-35) would be the horizontal
value, which is often four or five times as large as the vertical value.
The theory of radial drainage into sand drains, including allowance for "smear" effects on
the sides of the holes from soil on the auger flights that reduce inflow, has been presented
by Richart (1959) [see also Landau (1978)]. Since one is fortunate to determine the order of
magnitude of k (the exponent of 10), for practical purposes the time for consolidation of a
layer can be computed as follows:

1. Take H = \ the longest distance between sand drains, m.
2. Compute cv using Eq. (2-35) with k = horizontal coefficient of permeability (or your best
estimate of that value), m/day.
3. Use T from Table 2-4 for the appropriate percentage of consolidation. For 90 percent con-
solidation use T = 0.848.
4. Solve Eq. (6-4) for tc in the time unit of days.

The calculated time will be somewhat in error from factors such as vertical drainage within
the consolidating layer, presence of thin sand seams, one- or two-way vertical drainage, how
the distance H compares with the clay thickness, etc.
Sand drains are installed by several procedures in diameters ranging from 150 to 750 mm.
Landau (1966; describes several that are still current:

1. Mandrel-driven pipes. The pipe is driven with the mandrel closed. Sand is put in the pipe,
which then falls out the bottom as the pile is withdrawn, forming the drain. Air pressure
is often used to ensure continuity and densify the sand.
2. Driven pipes. The soil inside is then removed using high-pressure water jets. The rest of
the procedure is the same as method 1.
3. Rotary drill. A casing is used as required, then the boring is filled with sand. Any casing
used is pulled as the boring is filled. The sand may be rammed as necessary to increase
its density, producing some enlargement of the column over the drilled diameter.
4. Continuous-flight hollow auger. The sand may be introduced using air pressure through
the hollow stem to fill the cavity as the auger is withdrawn.

Figure 6-2 Two commonly used methods of constructing sand drains. [Landau (1966).]
Figure 6-2 illustrates methods 1 and 4.
Note that if we construct a pattern of sand drains using displacement-driven columns and
then later construct the interior drains (also using displacement columns) the site drainage
should be much more rapid since the excess pore pressure produced when installing the in-
terior drains can drain laterally into the existing drains as well as back into the just-installed
drains.
Soil drainage is related to settlement (volume change), and the larger the settlement under
preload, the less to be expected when the structure is built. Drainage is also related to the
change in the natural water content since a change in void space results in a permanent change
in water content for saturated soils. The change in water content is also a measure of the
improvement in the undrained shear strength su.

6-6.2 Wick Drains
Wick drains are now being widely used in lieu of sand columns for soil drainage. A wick
drain is a geotextile consisting of a grooved plastic or paper core covered by plastic or paper
membranes to produce a "wick" ranging from about 100 to 300 mm wide X 4 to 6 mm thick
and of the necessary length. The membrane cover provides a permeable soil barrier to reduce
core clogging. The core provides a ready conduit to the surface into a sand or textile filter
blanket or into horizontal trench drains.

The particular attraction of wick drains is economy since installation costs per meter are
typically one-quarter to one-fifth those of sand drains. They can be installed to depths up to
30 m using a conventional vibratory hammer (as used for pile driving) and a special wick
installation rig. According to Morrison (1982) wick drains have about 80 percent of the soil
consolidation market—probably about 80-85 percent in 1995. Several references and some
design theory on wick drains are cited by Koerner (1990). For current materials consult re-
cent issues of the "Geotechnical Fabrics Report" published monthly by the Industrial Fabrics
Association International (see footnote 5 on p. 368).
The same approximate equations for sand drains can be used for wick drains to establish
spacing and estimate time for consolidation to occur.
Wick drains provide no strengthening effect on the soil (unless they are laid horizontally)
except for that resulting from the reduced water content and for the void ratio reduction that
may result from any increase in effective stresses within the soil mass.
Note that the drainage process can be considerably speeded by installing mandrel-driven
pipe displacement sand drains interior to the peripheral wicks.

6-7 SAND COLUMNS TO INCREASE SOIL STIFFNESS
Outside the United States—particularly in the Asian and Pacific Rim regions—sand columns
are widely used to increase soil stiffness in both sand and clay deposits. Soil stiffness (or
improvement) is directly related to the increase in either the SPT blow count N or the CPT
cone resistance qc. That is, if the initial soil resistance (N or qc) is too low to give an adequate
bearing capacity, sand columns might be an economical solution, i.e., use the N after installing
the columns for computing the bearing capacity.
The use of sand columns is mostly a trial-experience combination process where their use
is appropriate. That is, a trial spacing is chosen and sand columns are inserted. Sand columns
are usually drilled at diameters D0 between 600 and 800 mm, but after construction the actual
column diameters Df range from 1.5 to 1.6DO. Column depths usually range from about 3 to
8 m but depend on site and purpose.
The before and after stiffness is measured along with the amount of sand needed to pro-
duce the required end product. That spacing and/or column density producing the required
degree of soil improvement is then specified for that site. Barksdale and Takefumi (1991) cite
some equations (see Fig. 6-3) that attempt to quantify some of this process, but the several
assumptions used make it necessary to always verify the improvement using either the SPT
or CPT. It is also necessary for contractor payment to measure the actual volume of sand used.
To quantify a project approximately one would make a best estimate of the current in situ
void ratio eo. Next one would make an estimate of the final void ratio ef based on available
information or by simply deciding the void ratio should be some value.
You should refer to the previously cited reference for the use of sand columns to strengthen
clay deposits.
Stone columns can also be used in sand deposits and they are constructed in a similar
manner. Their use is not recommended in sand, however, since the sand column can be con-
structed more economically. The reason is that the in situ sand can be used as the primary
source for the column material, which can then be supplemented with a smaller amount of
imported material, whereas the full volume of the stone column would have to be imported.


For the initial conditions:

V S
The initial volume is

= Vs+eoVs
= Vs(l+e0)
For the final conditions:

Noting that the total volume is now V0 - V5 + V'v + s
we can find the sand volume s per unit of depth by
proportion as follows:

The sand ratio as per unit treatment (sand column)
depth is:

A tentative column spacing distance s for square
grid (as shown in the figure) is 5 = W^

Solution. For this problem we have A = 3 x 3 = 9 m 2 and for a 1-m depth,
V o = 9 x l = 9 m 3
From V0 = Vs + eoVs = V5(I + e0) (see Fig. 6-3) we obtain
Vs = 9/1.8 = 5 m 3
The original Vv = V 0 - V5 = 9 — 5 = 4 m3. The theoretical volume of sand required per meter of
depth is
s = ^-(eo - ef) = ^ ( 0 . 8 - 0.5) = 5(0.3) = 1.5 m3
Still to be determined is the drill diameter, the depth of the sand column, and whether a final
void ratio ef = 0.5 is obtainable.

6-8 STONE COLUMNS
If, instead of using sand for the column, gravel or stones are used, the result is a stone column.
The vibratory devices or procedure no. 1 used to install sand drains and sand columns can
also be used to insert gravel or stone columns into the soil. The granular material commonly
ranges in gradation from about 6 to 40 mm (| to 1 \ inches).
Stone columns may be used in sand deposits but have particular application in soft, inor-
ganic, cohesive soils. They are generally inserted on a volume displacement basis, that is, a
600- to 800-mm diameter hole is excavated to the desired depth Lc. The depth may be on
the order of 5 to 8 m, and sometimes the hole requires casing to maintain the shaft diameter.
Stone is introduced into the cavity in small quantities and rammed (while simultaneously
withdrawing any casing). The rammed stone increases the drilled diameter of the stone col-
umn shaft, and it is necessary to record the hole depth Lc and volume of stone Vc used for the
column so that the final nominal shaft diameter can be approximately computed. The lateral
expansion of the column due to ramming will induce excess pore pressures in clay, but these
rapidly dissipate back into the much larger voids in the granular column. The net effect is to
produce a fairly rigid vertical stone mass (the stone column) surrounded by a perimeter zone
of somewhat stronger material which has a slightly reduced void ratio. This insertion method
also ensures intimate contact between soil and column.
The vibroflotation (see Fig. 6-6) method can be used to produce a stone column by sinking
the device, backfilling the cavity with stone, and then raising and lowering the vibroflot while
adding additional stone. The result is a densely compacted stone column of some depth with
a diameter on the order of 0.5 m to 0.75 m.
Similarly, a closed end pipe mandrel can be driven to the desired depth and a trip valve
opened to discharge the stone. Either a rammer packs the soil through the pipe as it is with-
drawn and with stone added as needed, or the mandrel is withdrawn until the valve can be
closed and this used to ram against the stone to expand and densify the column.


Stone columns are spaced from 1.2 m to about 3 m on center on a grid covering the site.
There is no theoretical procedure for predicting the combined improvement obtained, so it
is usual to assume that the foundation loads are carried only by the several stone columns
with no contribution from the intermediate ground. Work on pile caps by the author indicates
that this is reasonable when the stone columns are more than about 10 times as stiff as the
surrounding soil. Also a compacted layer of granular material should be placed over the site
prior to placing the footings.
An approximate formula for the allowable bearing pressure qa of stone columns is given
by Hughes et al. (1975)

qa = ^(4c + <r'r) (6-5)

where Kp = tan2(45° + 0/2)
cf)' = drained angle of internal friction of stone
c = either drained cohesion (suggested for small column spacings) or the un-
drained shear strength su when the column spacing is over about 2 m
a'r = effective radial stress as measured by a pressuremeter (but may use 2c if pres-
suremeter data are not available)
SF = safety factor—use about 1.5 to 2 since Eq. (6-5) is fairly conservative
The allowable load Pa on the stone column of average cross-sectional area Ac =
0.7854D^01 is
Pa = qaAc (6-5a)
where qa = allowable bearing pressure from Eq. (6-5)
We can also write the general case of the allowable column load Pa as
Pa = (csAs + AcCpNc) - — (6-5b)

where C5 = side cohesion in clay—generally use a "drained" value if available;
cs is the side resistance (yzK tan S) in sand
Cp = soil cohesion at base or point of stone column
As = average stone column perimeter area

To compute As, use the in-place volume of stone Vc and initial column depth Lc as follows:
ACLC = 0.7854Dc2olLc = Vc and £>col = J ^541«
A s = 7rDC0\Lc
Observe that, by using the volume of stone Vc, the diameter Dcoi computed here is the nominal
value. In Eq. (6-5a),
Nc = bearing capacity factor as used in Chap. 4, but use 9 for clay soils if
LC/DQOI > 3 (value between 5.14 and 9 for smaller L/D)


The allowable total foundation load is the sum of the several stone column contributions
beneath the foundation area (perhaps 1, 2, 4, 5, etc.).
Stone columns should extend through soft clay to firm strata to control settlements. If the
end-bearing term (AccpNc) of Eq. (6-5b) is included when the column base is on firm strata,
a lateral bulging failure along the shaft may result. The bulge failure can develop from using
a column load that is too large unless the confinement pressure from the soil surrounding the
column is adequate. The failure is avoided by load testing a stone column to failure to obtain
a Puit from which the design load is obtained as Puit/SF or by using a large SF in Eq. (6-5b)
or by not including the end-bearing term (now one can use a smaller SF).
Taking this factor into consideration gives a limiting column length Lc (in clay based on
ultimate resistance) of
Aiit ^ ?rDcolLccs + 9cpAc Ac = 0.7854D^1
Solving for L 0 we obtain

Lc * P"» " 7 ' 0 7 ^ (6-6)
7rDC0\Cs
where all terms have been previously identified.
Settlement is generally the principal concern with stone columns since their bearing ca-
pacity is usually quite adequate. No method is currently available to compute settlement on a
theoretical basis. Settlements are estimated on the basis of empirical methods, of which Fig.
6-4 is typical. From this figure we see that stone columns can reduce the settlement to nearly
zero depending on column area, spacing, and initial soil strength.
Note that any substantial improvement in settlement may require placing a granular sur-
charge over the treated area and rolling it prior to placing the foundation. A surcharge may be
necessary because the upper column depth to approximately 0.6 m is often somewhat loose
from the placing process and if not compacted may allow an unacceptable settlement.
Stone columns are not applicable to thick deposits of peat or highly organic silts or clays.

6-9 SOIL-CEMENT PILES/COLUMNS
The soil-cement pile (or column), SCP, is a relatively recent innovation for soil improvement
that uses a special (proprietary) soil drill bit. The drill bit advances into the soil, cutting and
grinding the soil and simultaneously injecting the cement (and any additives) slurry into the
cuttings. A shear (or fixed) blade somewhat larger than the hole diameter is located above the
drill head and is fixed into the sides of the boring to keep the soil between the drill and shear
blade held in place so that it can be well-mixed with the cement slurry (see Fig. 6-5a). When
the column depth is reached a soil-cement pile has been formed; the drill is withdrawn, with
the counterrotation further blending the soil cuttings with the injected cement slurry.
The process is extremely rapid and SCP diameters from 0.6 to 1 m can be readily produced
in lengths varying from about 1.5 to 10 m, but maximum depths to 35 m are possible. A typical
side view of an SCP is shown in Fig. 6-5b.
The design process is as follows:

1. Obtain representative samples of the soil to be improved, including unconfined compres-
sion qu and/or SPT blow counts N.


Example
Stone columns in soil with su — 25 kPa
Average column diam. = 1 m
Average column spacing = 2m center-to-center
AH of untreated ground estimated at 125 mm
Required: Estimate AH' of treated ground
Ac = OJSSA(I)2 = 0.7854
A .= 2 x 2 = 4
A/Ac = 4/0.7854 = 5.09 use 5.1
From figure interpolating into hatched zone
at su = 25 obtain
R = AH/AH' = 2 (or 50%)
AH' = 125/2 = 125(0.5) = 65 mm
Note generous rounding since method is
inexact.

2. Mix soil samples with different amounts of cement slurry and produce soil-cement cylin-
ders, which are cured as for any type of soil-cement project. Refer to ASTM D 1633 for
compressive strength tests and to D 2901 for cement content.
3. From cylinder compression tests determine the appropriate cement-slurry proportions
(water-cement ratio) and slurry injection per unit volume of pile.
4. When the SCPs have been installed and cured, obtain sufficient cores to ascertain the
unconfined compression core strength to verify quality.
Soil-cement piles may be used alone or, more commonly, in a closely spaced line to form a
wall to maintain an open excavation or basement space. If the spacing produces pile overlap
or the spacing is such that a jet-grout operation (of Sec. 6-10) can fill the space between any
two piles, a nearly water-tight wall can be formed. Basically a SCP wall [see Taki (1992)]
consists in obtaining the unconfined compression strength of the soil-cement cylinders qsc.
The unconfined shear strength is taken as
su,sc = 5#sc (same as for soil)
The allowable compressive strength for column design (without any reinforcement) is taken
as
/esc = ^ f (6-7)
using an SF = 3 (actually a little over 6, based on the unconfined compression strength). The
allowable side shear or skin resistance is computed as
Asc = IgA1 (6-la)
where Ai is as follows:

Clay soil Sandy soil Ai
qu < 20 kPa N55 < 5 0.25
> 20 kPa > 5 0.75

Point bearing capacity is computed as in Chap. 4 or Chap. 16. Settlements may be com-
puted based on methods given in Chap. 5 or in Chap. 16, and group stresses may be estimated
using the methods shown in Fig. 18-4.
Reinforcing bars can be inserted into the fresh SCP if it is necessary to attach a footing or
mat securely to the pile or pile group or if the pile(s) must resist bending.
The SCP is particularly suited to anchor floor slabs of dwellings and other buildings in
areas where there is a high GWT, possibility of wind shifting the structure or of wave action
eroding the soil from beneath the slab. It is also suited for use as an alternative to sand or
stone columns if drainage is not a consideration. It may also be used in intermediate locations
with sand or stone columns.

6-10 JET GROUTING
This procedure is now (1995) being used somewhat in the United States but it has been used
elsewhere since the early 1970s. There are several variations on this method. One procedure


consists in using a special drill bit with vertical and horizontal high-pressure water jets to
excavate through the soil. Cement based grout is then forced through the lateral jets to mix
with the small remaining amount of foundation material loosened during excavation. When
the grout sets the end result is a fairly hard, impervious column. Clearly this procedure is
somewhat similar to the soil-cement columns described earlier.
There are at least four procedures for producing jet-grouted columns, but the two principal
methods are
1. Breaking up the soil and mixing it in situ with the grout. A borehole of about the same
diameter as the grout rods is used and grout columns up to about 1 m in diameter can be
produced.
2. Breaking up and partially removing the in situ material—usually using boreholes much
larger than the grout rods—so that the resulting column is mostly grout. Grout columns
up to about 3 m in diameter can be produced by this method.
The grout columns (also called grout piles) have been used considerably in underpinning
structures to provide additional foundation support. The method is also used for general foun-
dation improvement, and very small diameter shafts are sometimes called root piles. Closely
spaced columns are sometimes used for excavation support (but would require the insertion
of reinforcing rods in the wet grout for bending resistance) and for groundwater control; how-
ever, the soil-cement columns previously described are probably better suited in most cases. A
more comprehensive description of this method is given in ASCE SP 12 [see ASCE (1987)].

6-11 FOUNDATION GROUTING AND CHEMICAL
STABILIZATION
In addition to the previously described uses of grouting, this term also describes the several
techniques of inserting some kind of stabilizing agent into the soil mass under pressure. The
pressure forces the agent into the soil voids in a limited space around the injection tube. The
agent reacts with the soil and/or itself to form a stable mass. The most common grout is a
mixture of cement3 and water, with or without fine sand.
In general, although grouting is one of the most expensive methods of treating a soil, it has
application in
1. Control of water problems by filling cracks and pores; that is, produce a reduction in per-
meability
2. Prevention of sand densification beneath adjacent structures due to pile driving
3. Reducing both pile driving and operating machinery vibrations by stiffening the soil
Generally this type of grouting can be used if the permeability of the deposit is greater
than 10~5 m/s. One of the principal precautions with grouting is that the injection pressure
should not cause the ground surface to heave. In using compaction grouting where a very stiff
displacement volume is injected into the ground under high pressure, however, lifting of the
ground surface as a grout lens forms is of minor consequence.

3Strictly, cement is a complex chemical agent.


Various chemicals can be used as grouting and/or stabilizing agents. Most chemical agents
are very expensive for use in foundation treatment. Many, however, have offsetting advan-
tages where low viscosity and setting time must be controlled. An in-depth discussion of the
advantages, disadvantages, and availability of chemical stabilizing agents other than those
previously described is beyond the scope of this text. The reader is referred to ASCE (1957,
1966) for very extensive bibliographies by the ASCE Committee on Grouting. A more cur-
rent status report is given by ASCE (1987, pp. 121-135). The following materials are widely
used as grout in soil stabilization for road and street work:
Lime
Cement
Fly ash (refer to Fly Ash: A Highway Construction Material, U.S. Department of Trans-
portation, June 1976)
Combinations of the above
They can also be used for building construction to improve the soil. Lime, for example, will
reduce the plasticity of most clays (by an ion exchange mechanism, usually Ca for Na), which
in return reduces volume-change potential (Sees. 7-1 and 7-9).

6-12 VIBRATORY METHODS TO INCREASE
SOIL DENSITY
The allowable bearing capacity of sands depends heavily on the soil conditions. This is re-
flected in the penetration number or cone resistance value as well as in the angle of internal
friction (/>. It is usually not practical to place a footing on loose sand because the allowable
bearing capacity (based on settlements) will be too low to be economical.
Additionally, in earthquake analyses the local building code may not allow construction
unless the relative density is above a certain value. Table 6-1 gives liquefaction-potential
relationships between magnitude of earthquake and relative density for a water table about
1.5 m below ground surface. This table can be used for the GWT up to about 3 m below
ground surface with slight error. The relative density is related to penetration testing as shown
in Table 3-4 after correcting the measured SPT N to Nj0 [see Eq. (3-3)].
The methods most commonly used to densify cohesionless deposits of sand and gravel with
not over 20 percent silt or 10 percent clay are vibroflotation and insertion and withdrawal of
a vibrating pile [termed Terra-Probing, see Janes (1973)].
Vibroflotation (patented by the Vibroflotation Foundation Co.) utilizes a cylindrical pen-
etrator 432 mm in diameter, 1.83 m long, and weighing about 17.8 kN. An eccentric mass
rotates inside the cylinder at about 1,800 rpm to develop a horizontal centrifugal vibration
force of about 90 kN. The device has water jets top and bottom with a flow rate of between
225 and 300 L/min at a pressure of 430 to 580 kPa. Figure 6-6 illustrates the general pro-
cedure for using vibroflotation to densify a granular soil mass. The device sinks at a rate
of between 1 and 2 m/min into the ground into the "quick" zone under the point caused by
a combination of excess water from the lower water jet and vibration. When the Vibroflot
reaches the desired depth, depending on footing size and stratum thickness, say 2 to 3B, and
after a few moments of operation, the top jet is turned on and the Vibroflot is withdrawn at
the rate of about 0.3 m/min. Sand is added to the crater formed at the top from densification
as the device is withdrawn, typically about 10 percent of the compacted volume. Compaction
volumes of 7500 to 15 000 m3 in an 8-hr work shift are common. The probe is inserted in a

grid on 1- to 3- or 5-m centers depending on densification desired, maximum densification
being in the immediate vicinity of the probe hole. Bearing capacities of 250 to 400 kPa can
be obtained using this method.
The Terra-Probe (patented by the L. B. Foster Co.) method involves mounting a vibratory
pile driver on a probe (pile) and vibrating it into and out of the soil to be densified. This
device can be used in all soils where the vibroflotation method is applicable. This device
is also applicable in underwater work, e.g., shoreline construction. The probe is inserted on
spacings of 1.2 to 5 m depending on the amount of densification required.
Whether densification is adequate is determined by comparing in situ Af or CPT data before
and after vibration. Generally it is necessary to field-test a grid to determine optimum spacing,
depth, and any other factors that might affect the efficiency of the process.

6-13 USE OF GEOTEXTILES TO IMPROVE SOIL
A geotextile (also geofabric) may be defined as a synthetic fabric that is sufficiently durable to
last a reasonable length of time in the hostile soil environment. A number of synthetic fabrics
made from polyester, nylon, polyethylene, and polypropylene are used to improve the soil in
some manner. The fabrics may be woven or knitted into sheets and used in either sheets or
strips or formed into geogrids4 to reinforce the soil mass. They may be made impermeable
for use as waste pond or sanitary landfill liners.
They may be permeable sheets or rods used to drain the soil. For drainage the geotextile
depends on having a much larger coefficient of permeability k than the surrounding soil so
that the geotextile attracts water by producing a hydraulic gradient between the textile and the
soil to be dewatered. For example, placing a permeable fabric against the back of a retaining
wall will reduce the lateral (hydrostatic) pressure against the wall as the water intersects the
fabric, drains down to drain pipes or holes in the wall, and exits. Permeable rods (wick drains)
can be inserted into the soil mass, on spacings somewhat similar to sand drains but much more
rapidly, to increase drainage. The water flows laterally to the drain and easily upward to the
ground surface since the k of the drain is several orders of magnitude larger than that of the
soil being drained. This type of drainage can be used in conjunction with surcharging (similar
to sand drains). Certain fabric sheets may be installed in the soil in lieu of sand blankets for
soil drainage.
Much of the present use of geotextiles is involved with soil protection or reinforcement.
The former involves control of erosion but may also entail isolating a soil mass from water. A
particular installation may include excavating 0.5 to 1.5 m of soil that is susceptible to volume
change, installing a plastic film, then carefully backfilling. Subsurface water migrating to the
surface is blocked by the film so that the upper soil does not become saturated and undergo
volume change. Obviously, careful site grading and protection against water entry from above
are also required. A similar installation in colder regions can be used to control frost heave. A
film of plastic may be used beneath 100 to 150 mm of coarse granular base beneath basement
slabs to control basement dampness.
Geotextiles can be used in strips (or sheets or geogrids) to reinforce a soil mass. This
usage is common for reinforced earth walls considered in Chap. 12 but may be carried out

Grids are similar to welded wire fabric except that usually the grid rods in one direction do not lie on top of the
rods in the orthogonal direction.


for embankments so that steeper slopes can be used or so that compaction can be made to the
edge of the slope, or to improve the bearing capacity of poor soil underlying the embankment.
Geotextiles and geogrids have potential application beneath footings and across culverts,
both to improve bearing capacity and to spread the loaded area. The interaction of the fabric
(dimensions large relative to soil grains) and soil effectively increases the angle of internal
friction (between fabric and soil) and cohesion (fabric tension). Current problems with us-
ing geotextile sheets/strips or geogrids to increase bearing capacity are in determining the
horizontal and vertical spacings of the reinforcement and in controlling settlement. Since
improvement is being made on poor ground, the reinforcement will carry substantial tensile
stresses. Geotextiles in tension tend to deform considerably (they stretch) under relatively
small stresses. Foundation reinforcements would, as a consequence, have to be relatively
thick in order to control vertical movement—and thickness is directly related to cost. Al-
ternatives such as piles or soil excavation and replacement with imported fill may be more
economical than excavation and replacement with existing soil and geotextile reinforcement.
At the present time, an abundance of theory is not available to compute the required
amount, type, or geometry of geotextile reinforcement.
For hazardous fill and similar lining applications strength is not the major consideration,
but great care must be exercised to ensure that sheet laps are sealed so that contaminated
leachate cannot escape. It is necessary to lap and seal sheets since liners may cover several
hectares (or acres) of ground and sheets are available in finite widths usually under about 5 m.
Geotextiles have not yet been in use for a long service period, but their use is spreading
very rapidly. There have been, to date, several international conferences on geotextile usage,
a textbook by Koerner (1990), occasional papers in the several applicable journals cited in
this text, the ASCE (1987) special publication, as well as a Geotextile Fabrics Report.5 There
are also regularly scheduled international conferences on geotextiles.

6-14 ALTERING GROUNDWATER CONDITIONS
From the concept of submerged unit weight it is evident that the intergranular pressure can be
increased by removing the buoyant effect of water. This can be accomplished by lowering the
water table. In many cases this may not be feasible or perhaps only as a temporary expediency.
Where it is possible, one obtains the immediate increase in intergranular pressure of ywzw,
where zw is the change in GWT elevation.
It is usually impossible to lower the GWT exactly within the limits of one's own property.
Thus, the increase in effective pressure also occurs beneath adjacent properties and can result
in damage to those owners. The result may be cracked pavements and/or buildings, and the
owners will certainly seek damages.
Note that it may be possible to raise the GWT. This process can also have an adverse effect
on adjacent properties and requires careful analysis before being undertaken.
Since any activity that alters the GWT location will have some kind of effect on the en-
vironment, it will usually be necessary to get permission from appropriate environmental
agencies. Otherwise litigation is almost certain to follow.

FACTORS TO CONSIDER
IN FOUNDATION DESIGN

7-1 FOOTING DEPTH AND SPACING
Footings should be carried below

1. The frost line
2. Zones of high volume change due to moisture fluctuations
3. Topsoil or organic material
4. Peat and muck
5. Unconsolidated material such as abandoned (or closed) garbage dumps and similar filled-
in areas.
Footings should be placed below the frost line because of possible frost heave of the build-
ings and because alternate freezing and thawing of the soil tends to maintain it in an uncon-
solidated or loose state. Footings should also be placed below any topsoil layer, for topsoil is
loose and usually contains organic matter.
However, aside from the consideration that the soil may be loose, interior footings may
be placed at convenient depths since the building warmth should control frost. Figure 7-
1 presents approximate maximum frost depths for various parts of the United States; local
building codes should be consulted for design values, which may be based on local experi-
ence and therefore would be more realistic. Recent weather extremes may be obtained from
weather records as a check that possible cold-weather cycles are not increasing the frost depth.
When footings are to be placed adjacent to an existing structure, as indicated in Fig.
7-2, the line from the base of the new footing to the bottom edge of the existing footing
should be 45° or less with the horizontal plane. From this requirement it follows that the dis-
tance m of Fig. 7 -2a should be greater than the difference in elevation of the two footings, z/.


Figure 7-1 Approximate frost-depth contours in meters for the United States, based on a survey by the author
of a selected group of cities.

This approximation should produce very conservative pressures in that zone where there is a
contribution from more than one footing.
Conversely, Fig. l-2b indicates that if the new footing is lower than the existing foot-
ing, there is a possibility that the soil may flow laterally from beneath the existing footing.
This may increase the amount of excavation somewhat but, more importantly, may result in
settlement cracks in the existing building. This problem is difficult to analyze; however, an
approximation of the safe depth z/ may be made for a <j>-c soil using Eqs. (2-54) and (2-55)
since &?> = 0 on the vertical face of the excavation. The vertical pressure a\ would include
the pressure from the existing footing. This analysis is as follows:
(Tx « yzf + q0
o-3 = 0 = (TiK - 2c JK [Using Eqs. (2-54) and (2-55)]
= yzfK + qoK-2cy[K
Solving for excavation depth z/ (and using a SF), we obtain
= 2c _ qo
f (SF)
7JK (SF)T
This equation indicates two factors for consideration:

1. If the soil is a sand (does not have cohesion) one cannot excavate to a depth greater than
that of the existing foundation.
2. The excavation depth of a <f)-c soil is limited by the preceding equation.

The K in these equations is a lateral pressure coefficient of Ka ^ K < Kp and considered
in some detail in Chap. 11.

Make m > z/.
Figure 7-2 Location considerations for spread footings.

Figure 7-3 illustrates how a problem can develop if the excavation for the foundation of
the new structure is too close to the existing building. In this case the qNq term of the bearing-
capacity equation is lost; for most foundations below the ground surface this is a major com-
ponent of the bearing capacity as shown in the illustrative bearing-capacity examples of
Chap. 4.
It is difficult to compute how close one may excavate to existing footings such as those of
Figs. 7-2 or 7-3 before the adjacent structure is distressed. The problem may be avoided by
constructing a wall (sheet pile or other material; Chap. 13 or 14) to retain the soil in essentially
the K0 state outside the excavation.
One of the major problems in making an excavation for new construction in urban ar-
eas is to do so without causing damage to adjacent properties from the construction work or
vibrations developed during construction. These may be either real or imagined and where
possible a photographer should obtain pre- and postconstruction photographs for the project
files.
Underground defects or utilities may affect the foundation depth, for example, limestone
caverns, old mine tunnels, soft material, sewer tunnels, telephone-cable conduits, and pos-

sible flaws created by pumping out soil fluids (oil, water). Bridging action may be adequate
for some cavities or across soft lenses but should be relied on only after a careful study of the
underground conditions.
In other cases, the solution may require a different type of foundation (such as piles or
caissons) or even an abandonment of the site.

7-2 DISPLACED SOIL EFFECTS
Soil is always displaced by installing a foundation. In the case of spread footings the displace-
ment is the volume of the footing pad and the negligible amount from the column resting on
the footing. In cases where a basement is involved, the basement floor slab usually rests di-
rectly on top of the footing pad. In other cases, a hole is excavated for the footing, the footing
and column are installed, and the remainder of the hole is backfilled to the ground surface
as illustrated in Fig. l-4a. When the footing is below ground, a concrete pedestal is used
to connect to steel columns to avoid corrosion; for concrete columns, the column is simply
attached to the footing with dowels at the footing level. Figure l-4b illustrates the condition
of footings beneath basements and walls. Figure IAc illustrates placing of a mat foundation.
The backfill soil should be carefully compacted over the footing (Fig. 1-Aa) if a floor slab
is to rest on the ground surface. Select free-draining backfill is carefully placed around the
basement walls as shown in Figs. l-4b and c, usually with a system of perimeter drainage to
control any hydrostatic pressure.

1. Is it a net pressure, i.e., pressure in excess of the existing overburden pressure that can be
safely carried at the foundation depth D (based on settlement limitations)?
2. Is it a gross pressure, i. e., the total pressure that can be carried at the foundation depth,
including the existing overburden pressure (and based on soil strength considerations)?

The bearing-capacity equations are based on gross soil pressure qu\u which is everything
above the foundation level. Settlements are caused only by net increases in pressure over the
existing overburden pressure. Therefore,

a. If the allowable pressure is based on the bearing-capacity equations of Chap. 4, the pres-
sure is a gross pressure.
b. If the allowable pressure is based on settlement considerations, it is a net pressure.

The computations then proceed according to whether the given conditions use gross or
net pressures. Whether the pressure is a gross (depends on soil strength) or a net (depends
on settlement limitations) value should be stated in the foundation report submitted to the
designer; however, it often is not.
Most designers tend to treat the bearing pressure provided by the soils engineer as an
accurate value that cannot be exceeded. In fact, from material presented in Chaps. 2, 3, and
4 relating to sampling, testing, and computation difficulties, the bearing pressure is hardly
an exact value at all. Thus, it makes little difference if we exceed by 2 to about 10 kPa (0.1
to 0.2 ksf) the given values unless these are under 50 kPa (1 ksf). In this case we probably
should not exceed the recommended values by over 2 kPa. We should be aware that if the
geotechnical consultant has recommended an allowable bearing pressure of 50 kPa or under,
the testing to obtain qa has been done with more than routine care; but the report to the client
should state whether qa is based on settlement or soil strength limitations.
By noting that bearing-capacity recommendations contain both approximations and em-
piricism, the computations for footing design in the following chapters can be greatly simpli-
fied. For example, the author tends to omit the additional small pressure contribution from the
footing volume of soil displaced by the footing concrete. Generally, by rounding the footing
dimension to the next larger multiple of 10 mm (or 3 in.) the recommended "allowable" soil
pressure is not exceeded. A further mitigating factor is the common practice in 0-c soils of
digging a slightly oversized hole for directly pouring the concrete without using forms since
the labor and material costs for forms greatly exceed the small amount of additional concrete
required.
Obviously, one should look at the individual problem before neglecting or exceeding al-
lowable values. One should not neglect the additional pressure from the concrete-displaced
soil if, say, the footing is 2 m thick or if a greater depth of backfill is replaced than removed.
On the other hand, an inspection of Fig. 1-Ab and c indicates that we can remove a greater
mass of soil and the net pressure can be increased without causing settlement if this mass is not
replaced. In the extreme case we can remove enough soil mass to equalize the building mass
and "float" the building onto the soil underlying the basement with little or no settlement.
This is called a floating foundation. The reason for stating "little or no settlement" is that
in the usual case of this much excavation, the soil underlying the basement will expand (or
heave) from loss of overburden pressure. Any mass placed on this expanded soil will result
in recovery of some of the expansion.


7-4 EROSION PROBLEMS FOR STRUCTURES ADJACENT
TO FLOWING WATER
Bridge piers, abutments, bases for retaining walls, and footings for other structures adjacent
to or located in flowing water must be located at a depth such that erosion or scour does not
undercut the soil and cause a failure. The scour depth will depend on the geological history of
the site (depth of prior erosion to bedrock and subsequent redeposition of sediments, stream
velocity, and area runoff).
Where the redeposition of sediments in the stream bed is on the order of 30 to 50 m,
a careful analysis of borings into the sediments to predict the depth of maximum scour is
necessary in order to provide a foundation that is economical.
It may be possible to use spread footings if they can be placed at sufficient depth, but
normally piles are required to support the foundation. An accurate prediction of scour depth
is necessary so as to use the shortest possible pile lengths. If careful records of driving re-
sistances are kept, one may predict the scour depth as being where the penetration (SPT or
CPT) resistance increases substantially [see Kuhn and Williams (1961)].
An NCHRP (1970) report lists some 13 equations proposed by several authorities includ-
ing those of Laursen and Toch (1956) and later proposals by Laursen (1962). This report
indicates that engineering judgment is used more than any other method for estimating scour
depth. The equations by different authorities for the same problem can compute scour depths
differing by as much as 1000 percent!
Scour occurs principally during floods, but some scour may occur at other times; in either
case a scoured-out pit (or depression) in the stream bed may result. Scour holes formed during
floods are usually refilled as high water falls. Scour is accelerated if the foundation creates
channel obstruction; thus, to reduce scour the foundation should create a minimum obstruction
to normal streamflow patterns.
Normally the approach to scour is as follows:

1. Determine the foundation type.
2. Estimate the probable depth of scour, effects, etc.
3. Estimate the cost of foundations for normal and various scour conditions.
4. Determine the cost versus risk, and revise the design accordingly.

Because scour has been attributed to several bridge foundation failures with some loss of
life, this phenomena has received some additional subsidized research, starting ca. 1989, to
find some means of better quantifying-—preferably by measuring—stream-bed scour during
high water periods. Lagasse et al. (1995) cite two reasonably low-cost measuring devices for
approximately measuring scour at bridge abutments and/or piers that are now available.
It should be self-evident that a device to measure stream-bed scour must be rugged to
survive high water velocity and debris impacts. The device also should have sufficient reli-
ability that the necessary information can be taken at the bridge deck level so that a diver is
not required for underwater verification. Since stream-bed scour depends on the amount and
shape of the channel obstruction, and this is known only after the structure has been built, it
is still necessary to utilize the foregoing four design steps. Direct measuring of actual scour
(for that highwater stage) is only possible after construction. Direct measurements are use-
ful, however, both for confidence and for remedial measures if the measured scour depth is
greater than the design scour depth.


7-5 CORROSION PROTECTION
In polluted ground areas such as old sanitary landfills, shorelines near sewer outfall lines from
older industrial plants, or backwater areas where water stands over dead vegetation, there can
be corrosion problems with metal foundation members as well as with concrete. Concrete is
normally resistant to corrosion; however, if sulfates are present, it may be necessary to use
sulfate-resistant concrete. It may occasionally be necessary to use air-entrained concrete for
foundation members.
Use of treated timber piling instead of metal piling may be required where the soil has a
pH much above 9.5 or below 4.0 (7 being neutral).
The only publications treating corrosion of steel piles are Monographs 58 (dated 1962) and
127 (dated 1972) published by the National Bureau of Standards,1 and Technical Manual 27
published by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, May 1969. AU of these publications are
probably out of print.
Initial concerns in these references were formulated into design recommendations to install
steel piles only in situations where they were completely submerged (this also applies to
timber piling). They were not suggested for use in sea water unless coated and not allowed
to undergo wet-dry cycles. These conditions are nearly impossible to meet in areas where
substantial elevation differences occur from tidal action. In these cases concrete piles were
recommended.
The problem is that time-dependent corrosion is now becoming a factor for steel piles
installed on the basis of the foregoing. They are approaching an age where corrosion accu-
mulation is to the point that many piles are becoming unsafe.

7-6 WATER TABLE FLUCTUATION
A lowered water table increases the effective pressure and may cause additional settlements.
A raised water table may create problems for the owner from the following:

1. Floating the structure (making it unstable or tilting it)
2. Reducing the effective pressure (causing excessive settlements)
3. Creating a wet basement if the basement walls are not watertight

These problems can usually be solved by introducing some type of drainage so that wa-
ter does not accumulate around the building walls or produce hydrostatic uplift beneath the
basement. The use of drain tile around the basement perimeter is common for residential
dwellings and some larger buildings. In other cases a sloping basement excavation that is
backfilled with granular material to the required horizontal level in combination with a well
(called a sump pit) at the low point that is fitted with a pump (a sump pump system) can be
used. The pump is preset to start pumping water as it rises to a critical level in the sump pit.
Where to pump the water may be a major concern as some municipalities do not allow this
kind of water to be emptied into sanitary sewers.

ington, DC.


A permanent lowering of the water table can sometimes be effected, but with the current
status of environmental concerns this will probably not be allowed.

7-7 FOUNDATIONS IN SAND AND SILT DEPOSITS
Foundations on sand and silt2 will require consideration of the following:
1. Bearing capacity.
2. Densification of loose deposits to control settlement.
3. Placing the footing at a sufficient depth that the soil beneath the footing is confined. If silt
or sand is not confined, it will roll out from the footing perimeter with a loss of density
and bearing capacity. Wind and water may erode sand or silt from beneath a footing that
is too near the ground surface.
4. Uncontaminated glacial silt deposits can have a large capillary rise because of the small
particle sizes. Sometimes these deposits can be stabilized by excavation to a depth of 0.6
to 1 m, followed by placement of a geotextile water barrier. The silt is then backfilled and
compacted to provide a suitable foundation. An overlying water barrier or other drainage
may also be necessary since downward-percolating water will be trapped by the lower
geotextile.

Foundations on silt or sand deposits may consist of spread footings, mats, or piles, depend-
ing on the density, thickness, and cost of densifying the deposit, and on the building loads.
Solid-section, large-volume piles may be used both to carry loads to greater depth in the de-
posit and as a means of compacting the deposit. Small-volume piles are normally used to
carry near-surface loads through loose sand deposits to firm underlying strata. In both sands
and silts the soil-cement pile, SCP, may be an economical alternative.
Spread footings are used if the deposit is dense enough to support the loads without exces-
sive settlements. Rapid or immediate settlements occur on noncohesive silt or sand deposits.
Much of the settlement resulting from construction loads and associated vibrations is built
out during erection—most of the remainder is landscaped.
It is poor practice to place foundations on sand deposits where the relative density is not at
least 60 percent or to a density of about 90 percent or more of the maximum density obtained
in a laboratory test. This dense state reduces the possibility of both load settlements and
settlement damage due to vibrations from passing equipment, earthquakes, or the like.
An inorganic (nearly pure) silt in a saturated condition cannot be compacted. The com-
paction effort produces a wave in front of the compactor and the entire mass may quiver (a
soil state sometimes called "bull liver"). When this type of deposit is encountered, the deposit
must be excavated and replaced with competent soil or else excavated and dried to a water
content that will allow compaction. Soil replacement is usually impossible so alternatives

2The principal difference between sand and silt is grain size. Sand sizes go down to about 0.05 mm, and silt begins
at about 0.05 mm and goes down to about 0.006 mm (see Table 2-2). Pure silt is inert (has no particle attraction),
but deposits seldom exist in nature that are not contaminated with clay particles or cementation agents from organic
materials. As a result of these contaminants, one can obtain plasticity indexes. Deposits with plasticity indexes are
usually treated as cohesive materials.


consist in drying the silt and encasing it in a geotextile to control water, mixing it with sand
and gravel sufficient to produce a stable condition when saturated, or using piles to carry the
load through the deposit to competent soil.
The allowable bearing capacity and estimated settlements for footings and mats on com-
petent sand and/or silt are computed using methods given in Chaps. 4 and 5.

7-8 FOUNDATIONS ON LOESS AND OTHER
COLLAPSIBLE SOILS
Collapsible soils are generally wind-blown (aeolian) deposits of silts, dune sands, and vol-
canic ash. Typically they are loose but stable, with contact points well-cemented with a water-
soluble bonding agent, so that certain conditions of load + wetting produce a collapse of the
soil structure with a resulting large settlement.
Loess is a special—but widely distributed—case of a silt deposit characterized by having
been deposited by wind. The grain distribution of loess deposits tends to be limited to ap-
proximately the range of 0.01 to 0.10 mm and is usually contaminated with clay and sand
particles (< 0.05 mm) and later by organic leachates. Nonsaturated, aged deposits are capa-
ble of standing on vertical cuts or banks due to interparticle cementation, but saturation can
produce slough-offs and/or a large vertical settlement, termed soil collapse. The collapse of
the soil structure may occur interior to any bank or vertical cut (i.e., is confined by K0 lateral
pressures) as noted by Feda et al (1995).
Loess is the predominating collapsible soil that engineers are confronted with. It is very
widespread, covering about 17 percent of the United States (see Fig. 7-5)—principally adja-
cent to the major rivers (Mississippi and Missouri). About 15 to 17 percent of Western Europe,
including parts of Belgium and France as well as portions of Germany, and Eastern Europe
(Slovakia, Romania, Hungary) are covered with loess deposits. The European deposits are
generally found adjacent to the major rivers, such as the Danube, the Rhine, and their larger
contributories. About 10 to 15 percent of the Russian Federation (south and southwest of
Moscow to the Caucasus mountains) and a part of Ukraine is covered by loessial deposits,
as well as large parts of China. Very little loess is found in Canada and none in Australia or
Africa (but both the latter have other wind-blown deposits), according to Flint (1971).
Figure 7-5 Location of major loess deposits in the United States. [Gibbs and Holland (I960).]


Loess appears to have been formed from the wind picking up inert pulverized silt-sized
rock particles produced by glacial action. These were carried to locales where either glacial
outwash or a flowing stream produced sufficient humidity in the air that the wind-borne soil
grains precipitated—usually on the eastern, or leeward sides of flowing water (at least in the
United States). It follows that nonglacial areas do not have loess deposits. Depths of loess
deposits range from less than 1 meter to more than 50 meters. Depths of 2 to 3 meters are
very common.
Loess and other collapsible deposits are characterized by a complete absence of gravel or
pebbles, with most of the material passing the No. 200 sieve (0.075 mm). The specific gravity
ranges from 2.60 to 2.80, but most values lie between 2.65 and 2.72. In situ dry densities range
from about 10 to 16.5 kN/m3.
Atterberg limits depend on the clay and/or organic contamination, and commonly wi
ranges from 25 to 55 and wp from 15 to 30 percent. Standard compaction tests (ASTM D
698) produce ydry on the order of 15.5 to 17.5 kN/m3 at optimum moisture contents from 12
to 20 percent according to Sheeler (1968).
Loess has a high in situ porosity, often more than 50 percent (or void ratio > 1.0), and is
thus highly susceptible to collapse upon saturation. Most in situ void ratios eo are in the range
from 0.67 to 1.50, according to Drannikov (1967).
The density of loess (and other collapsible soils) is one of the most significant parameters in
estimating collapse. Holtz and HiIf (1961) suggest that this be used together with the liquid
limit WL to estimate collapse potential. This suggestion in equation form from a chart and
somewhat linearized by the author is
ydry - 17.3 - 0.186(wL - 16) kN/m3 (7-1)
where WL is in percent. When the in situ density is less than that given by Eq. (7-1) the soil
is susceptible to collapse, with the severity of susceptibility increasing with a decrease in y.
It is not easy to predict the amount of collapse. One might use the following equation:

=

 hP ~ h

P x 1 Q 0 % ( 7 _ 2 )

hp

where Cp = estimated height change in percent
hp = length change from using an undisturbed tube sample subjected to the consol-
idation pressure anticipated in the field
h'p = length change from using an undisturbed, saturated tube sample subjected to
the same consolidation pressure as for hp. Both samples are of the same initial
length h.

Major problems in using Eq. (7-2) are obtaining undisturbed tube samples, cutting and
placing them into a device, and loading them to the required pressure (and with minimum
lateral restraint or side friction). In the field a major problem is associated with how deep is
the saturation zone that participates in the collapse.
Problem recognition is considered in some detail by Clemence and Finbarr (1981). One
procedure they gave suggests using a consolidation (or oedometer) test where the sample is
placed in the confining ring at the in situ water content and consolidated in increments to
about 200 kPa; then the ring is flooded with water and the load maintained for 24 hr. If there
is a large displacement, this is an indication of a structure collapse within the sample.


In general, after recognition of the collapse potential, one may use the site by doing one of
the following:
1. Compact (excavate and replace) the soil to ydry ^ 15.5 kN/m3.
2. Use an admixture during compaction. Admixtures may be lime, lime/fly ash, or Portland
cement.
3. Use some means to ensure that the collapsible soil does not get wet (often not practical).
4. Use piles through the collapsing soils to a more competent underlying stratum.

7-9 FOUNDATIONS ON UNSATURATED SOILS
SUBJECT TO VOLUME CHANGE WITH CHANGE
IN WATER CONTENT
Expansive soils undergo volume changes upon wetting and drying. For a volume change to
occur these soils must be initially unsaturated at some water content wo. When the water
content changes to a new value w\, the volume increases if w\ > wo or decreases if w\ < wo
unless wo is the shrinkage limit where wo = Ws-
These soils occur in an active zone, which starts at the ground surface and goes down to
the saturated part of the zone of capillary rise above the ground water table. Figure 7-6 is a
qualitative chart of variation of water content in the active zone.
Expansive soils are mostly found in arid and semiarid areas worldwide and contain large
amounts of lightly weathered clay minerals. Low rainfall has hindered the weathering of
more active clay minerals such as the smectite family to less active clay types such as illite
or kaolinite, and the rainfall has not been enough to leach the clay particles far enough into
the strata that the overburden pressure can control the swell.
In general, all clayey soils tend to shrink on drying and expand when the degree of satu-
ration S increases. Usually, the lower the shrinkage limit ws and the wider the range of the
plasticity index Ip, the more likely is volume change to occur (Table 7-1) and the greater the
amount of such change.
Volume change is particularly troublesome in large areas of the southwestern United
States, India, and Australia, and in parts of Africa and the Middle East that are subject to
long dry periods and periodic heavy rains of short duration. The dry periods tend to desiccate
the soil; then the sudden rainy season(s) cause large amounts of swelling near the ground
surface. There is not enough regular rainfall to leach and weather the troublesome clay min-
erals to greater depths; thus, they remain unaltered near the ground surface. During the rainy
season(s) they are rapidly wetted and quickly swell to form a water barrier to further water
entry, thus keeping the problem near the ground surface.
Soils in these areas are particularly troublesome to build on as they appear competent
during dry periods (with the possible exception of surface tension cracks). They would of
course remain competent if their water content is controlled in some manner, a difficult task.
What happens is that water vapor migrating from the ground water table, which may be at a
depth of many meters, condenses on the bottom sides of the floor slabs and footings. Anyone
can readily observe this phenomenon by turning over a flat rock in the field (even after a
prolonged dry spell) and noting the dampness on the underside.
Since a building is somewhat impermeable, similar to the flat rock in the field, the soil in
the interior zone eventually becomes wet to saturated from the condensation of upward-rising

water vapor. The soil will then swell unless the building provides sufficient weight to restrain
the swelling pressure, and buildings seldom provide the huge restraining pressures required
to control swelling.3
Cold storage buildings with an uninsulated thermal gradient may cause condensation of
the water vapor in the soil or create an upward flow of water vapor from the water table. Ice
lenses may form. These typically are more serious from either of two reasons: amplifying
swell or producing a semifluid zone when they melt if the temperature is sufficiently low.
With buildings, in addition to possible evaporation of soil water from the perimeter zone,
there is also the problem of soil in this region becoming dessicated from water absorption
through the roots of adjacent shrubbery and/or trees used in landscaping. Loss in soil moisture
by evaporation from heating the building or from beneath or adjacent to heating units such
as boilers can also create shrinkage volume changes.
Shrinkage tends to produce perimeter settlements (unless from heating units where the
interior may settle), which, in combination with any interior swell, develop larger differential

settlements than would be obtained from swelling action alone. By the way, the field rock
also has this problem (it is seldom wet from edge to edge) but is of no consequence. Figure
7-7 illustrates the typical case for buildings where the differential settlement is exaggerated
from interior swell and edge shrinkage.
In all of the shrinkage cases the amount of volume change is referenced to the initial
natural water content wo of the soil and the current natural water content w\. Volume changes
produced from shrinkage {w\ < wo) are usually smaller than volume changes from swell
(wi > wo).
Table 7-1 may be used as a guide in evaluating the potential for volume change of soils
based on easily determined index properties. In part, this table is a summary of data from
Holtz (1959) on several soils, which are correlated with some 50 soils from other areas, in-
cluding a large number of Indian black cotton soils by Dakshanamurthy and Raman (1973).
In terms of relative values a "low" volume change might be taken as not more than 5 percent
whereas "very high" could be interpreted as over 25 percent.

Figure 7-7 Idealized expansion soil problem for a building. The two end zones AB and CD are shrinkage regions of indeter-
minate length at the foundation edges. Soil is shown in contact with the slab ends but this may not always occur (i.e., there may
be a crack between the slab and the soil). The interior region BC represents swell (or heave) from upward-migrating moisture.
An estimate of the crack-producing tension stresses might be obtained by using either a solution for a beam on elastic foundation
(diskette program B-5) or for a plate (diskette program B-6). In this type of analysis, assume a zone (or interior slab region) of
length BC with ks > 0 and the two end zones (or a perimeter zone for slabs) AB, CD with ks = 0.

7-9.1 Volume-Change-Related Consolidation
Test (ASTM D 4546)
An approximation of the consolidation test (ASTM D 4546) can be used to estimate soil
heave or shrinkage. There are three different methods—A, B, and C—of performing this test.
Basically, this test uses standard consolidation (ASTM D 2435) equipment; a plot of e versus
log p is made, from which the necessary swell/shrinkage data are obtained. One may use
the consolidation ring sample from the compaction test outlined in the next section for the
Expansion Index. It is necessary to obtain the in situ void ratio eo and the void ratio ej after
swell or compression. Best results are obtained by dividing the active zone Zd of Fig. 7-6 into
several sublayers of thickness //;, determining the void ratio of each as ^1-, and performing
the test on a sample obtained from each sublayer. When this procedure is done, the following
equation is used:
Vc = ^- = t£ZlH • 100 (%) (7-3)
Hn 1 + eOi
where LH1 = change in height of laboratory sample of thickness HiL
efi = final void ratio of the laboratory sample
eoi = both initial void ratio of laboratory sample and the field void ratio

Using the laboratory percentage change from Eq. (7-3) to represent the field settlement ( - )
percent or swell (+) percent, we find the field settlement can be directly computed as

A// = ]T Q ^ W (in units ofH-) (7-4)

Volume change Vc is used as a percent (division by 100 converts Vc to a decimal).

7-9.2 Volume Change Related to the Expansion Index Ej
Anderson and Lade (1981) suggest using a parameter called the Expansion Index both to
recognize and to quantify soil volume change in a relative manner.
The expansion index Ei is obtained from using a standard compaction mold (dimensions
of 944 cm3) but cut and fitted in the midheight part with a removable 25-mm high ring. This
setup allows one to compact the soil using a method such as D 698 or D 1557. The soil used
is that passing the No. 4 (4.75-mm) sieve and the percent passing is defined as D4. After
compaction (and necessary weighing to determine compaction density and water content)
the top part of the mold is removed and soil is trimmed down to the 25-mm ring. The bottom
is also removed and the soil trimmed to the base of the 25-mm ring. Water content is obtained
from the trimmings, using two or three samples.
The 25-mm ring is then placed in a consolidation-type test configuration and put into a
device capable of providing substantial pressure to the sample. This is done to bring the
water content in the ring into a range of 49 to 51 percent. If the pressure device cannot apply
sufficient pressure to reduce the soil in the ring to a volume that yields the required water
content of 49 to 51 percent, the compaction part of the test is repeated using a higher initial
water content.


Once the ring sample has been compressed to a volume such that the water content is in the
49 to 51 percent range, it is fitted with a dial gauge or LVDT to measure expansion. It is then
loaded with a 6.9-kPa (1-psi) pressure and flooded with distilled water. The one-dimensional
expansion 8 H is determined either after 24 hr or after the rate of expansion (plotted on graph
paper) decreases to 0.005 mm/hr. An expansion index can now be computed as
E1 = 39.31(8H)D4 (7-5)
Here 8H = mm and D4 = decimal value of percent passing the No. 4 sieve. For layered soil
an Ei is computed for each layer, multiplied by a weighting factor, and summed. Weighting
factors from Anderson and Lade (1981) are as follows:

Depth, m Weight factor

0 < 0.3 0.4
0.3 < 0.6 0.3
0.6 < 0.9 0.2
0.9 < 1.2 0.1
>1.2m 0.0

The E\ can be used as shown in Table 7-1 to estimate volume change potential.

7-9,3 Volume Change Based on Soil Suction
To the present there have been seven international conferences on expansive soils. The sev-
enth conference4 was held in 1992. From these conferences it appears that soil suction holds
substantial promise for estimating a quantitative volume change. It does appear, however,
that the volume change equations tend to be more complicated with increasing conference
number. An additional major problem is that the equation authors tend to use different sym-
bols.
Once the major deterrent to using soil suction was the difficulty in obtaining the suction
stress. Now there are a number of procedures and equipment for obtaining the soil suction,
both in the laboratory and in the field. The following are available from commercial sources:
filter paper method (ASTM D 5298, in vol. 4.09), pressure plate apparatus, thermocouple
psychrometer; heat dissipation sensor, gypsum block, and fiberglass moisture cell.5 Equip-
ment (and some of their sources) for these procedures is briefly described by Lee and Wray
(1992).
Soil suction is currently defined in two ways:

1. In terms of pF, the equivalent capillary rise of water in cm
For example : 100 cm of H2O gives pF = 2.0
10 000 cm gives pF = 4.0

4Conference proceedings were published and are available (as of 1994) from Civil Engineering Department, Texas
Tech University, Lubbock, Texas 79409.
5Filter paper for that suction test can be obtained from a number of laboratory suppliers. Some of the equipment is
available from sources cited in the literature.


2. In an equation as follows:

h = (ua - uw) (in units of W1-) (7-6)
where h = soil suction (usually termed matric suction) and usually ( - )
ua = air pressure in soil pores—usually atmospheric
uw = pore water pressure in units consistent with ua
When the soil is saturated, S —» 100 percent and we have h -» 0.
When there is no moisture change or the soil is saturated, soil suction has no real signifi-
cance and the usual equations for bearing capacity and settlement can be used. When the soil
is saturated, either or both the qNq and the \yBNy terms in the bearing-capacity equation
will be reduced. For bearing capacity, unless there is some means to eliminate water changes
in the unsaturated region one should assume the soil is saturated, as this will be conservative.
Additional theoretical considerations may be obtained from the ASCE publication GT SP
No. 39, "Unsaturated Soils," or from the International Conferences on Expansive Soils—
especially the later ones from 4 to 7.
Of considerable interest is the volume change in situations where it is anticipated that the
soil above the groundwater table may undergo a change in the initial natural water content
wo that can range from 0 < (wo — Wf). The maximum possible for the final natural water
content Wf is a saturated state of 5 = 100 percent and the minimum is w/ -» 0.
Of additional interest is the depth in which this water content change occurs. At some
depth id (see Fig. 7-6) the saturated zone above any groundwater table is encountered. The
depth Zs represents the approximate depth of the active zone, in which water content varies
with the season. These water content changes may be drying or wetting from infiltration of
surface water during rainy periods.
A number of methods using soil suction as a significant parameter have been proposed to
estimate the volume change. Four of these are described by Snethen and Huang (1992), and
the two that seemed to provide the best predictions are given by the following:

Method 1. This method is given by Snethen and Huang (1992), who obtained it from
Mitchell and Avalle from the Fifth Conference on Expansive Soils in 1984. The equation6 is
n
AH = ^e1H1 (7-7)
i

where e = linear strain as AL/LO\LO = initial sample length; AL = change in length
during drying, usually until no further length change occurs (at about a water
content = w$)
Ht = thickness of sublayer / of depth zs made up of n layers

Equipment for performing the linear shrinkage test is available from several labora-
tory equipment suppliers. The linear strain required here can be obtained indirectly from the

terms to produce this form (which does not include a soil suction parameter).


standard shrinkage limit test (ASTM D 427 or D 4943) using equations given by Bowles
(1992). Using linear shrinkage equipment will produce a better estimate of linear strain than
back-computing it from a standard shrinkage limit test.
Method 2. This is Snethen and Johnson's method and the equation is as follows:7
^ = ^ , o g ^ _ ( 7 . 8 )
Ht 1 + eo hf + OLVf
where (in these equations)
Ct = suction compression index = a Gs/\0OB
a = slope of a curve of (1 + eo)/Gs versus water content wo occurring at void ratio
eo (see Fig. YLl-Ib)
B = obtained from the slope of a curve of log A versus corresponding water content

log ho = A — BWN, obtained from the curve slope

A typical set of plots and computations for log ho is shown on Fig. El-Ia.

Other Methods.
McKeen (1992) gives an equation of the following form:
n
AH = ^Ch -AA Hr f 'S units of H1 (7-9)
i

where Ch = suction compression index. It can be obtained from a plot of AV versus soil
suction pF, where pF ranges from about 5.5 at the shrinkage limit ws to field
values from about 2 to 2.5. Clearly volume change increases when the field
water content goes from pF = 5.5 down to pF = 2.0 to 2.5. The linear part
of the plot gives the slope defined as Ch = AV/ApF.
AA = some change in suction measured as change in pF.
H1 = thickness of fth layer, m or mm, and gives units of A//.
/ = lateral restraint factor as / = (1 + 2K0)/3 or similar.
s = coefficient of load effect defined as
s = 1.0 - 0.01P, Ps < 50% Cs = 0, at Ps = 100%)

Estimate the swell pressure Ps, or measure it, or use Eq. (7-10).
Fredlund and Rahardjo (1993, but suggested earlier by Fredlund in the Canadian Geotech-
nical Journal, vol. 1, 1979) suggest an equation in the general format of the consolidation
equation of Sec. 2-10. It is too complicated to include here, but the interested reader can
consult the 1993 reference and work back.

7Other forms of this equation are given in the reference, but this is the simplest.

Note that McKeen (1992, vol 2, pp. 79-81) discussed this example, and he raised the question
of whether the actual field-measured swell was ~ 200 mm or something less.

7-9.4 Volume Change Correlations Using Soil Index Properties
Correlations using index properties may give fair estimates of volume change. An estimate
of the overburden (or footing) pressure Ps necessary to restrain expansion to a tolerable (tol-
erable not precisely defined) quantity can be obtained from an equation by Komornik and
David (1969, p. 222) based on a statistical analysis of some 200 soils. This equation is
log Ps = 2.132 + 0.0208wL + 0.665prf - 0.0269W^ (kg/cm2) (7-10)
where WL, WN are liquid limit and natural moisture contents in percent and pd is the dry
density in g/cm3.
The percent swell can be used to compute an estimate of differential settlement. An equa-
tion used by Johnson and Snethen (1979), which compared reasonably well with measured
swell (or heave), is
log Sp = 0.0367wL - 0.0833wyv + 0.458 (percent) (7-11)
An equation presented by O'Neill and Ghazzaly (1977) is
Sp = 2.27 + 0.131 wL - 0.2IWN (percent) (7-12)
Both Eqs. (7-11) and (7-12) are based on statistics, and the water contents are to be used
as percentages. The free swell obtained from these equations may be reduced for confining
pressure av using an equation obtained by the author from interpretation of curves by Gogoll
(1970) for percent swell versus confining pressure. This equation is
S'p = S p ( l - A ^ T v ) (7-13)
where A = 0.0735 for SI and 0.52 for Fps units of kPa or ksf.
These equations can be expected to compute on the order of a ± 50 percent error, which
might not differ greatly from using consolidation or suction tests. Both of these equations
are given for percent swell so that some cross checking might be obtained as illustrated in
Example 7-2. Tables 5-6 and 5-7 should be used to see if the proposed structure can tolerate
the estimated (differential) heave.
Example 7-2.

Given. A soil with properties in Table 1 of Snethen (1980).

Required. Make an estimate of the probable swell in mm.


Solution. We will use average properties of the soil at the depth of interest, given in Snethen (1980)
as 8 ft (2.44 m) and as shown in the following table, edited from that reference. That is, add the
seven values of interest and divide by seven. Although this average includes soil properties below
the 8-ft depth used by Snethen, those properties are likely to somewhat affect the result and so will
be used here. The averaging procedure gives the following:

wL = 536/7 = 76.6%
wp = 168/7 = 24% ydry = 729.7/7 = 104.2 pcf
wN = 22.6% pd = 104.2/62.4 = 1.67 g/cm3
Total stratum thickness = 8 ft = 2.44 m
By Eq. (7-11) (water contents as percent), we can write
log Sp = 0.0367(76.6) - 0.0833(22.6) + 0.458
= 1.387
Sp = 101-387 = 24.4%
By Eq. (7-12) (water contents as percent), we have
Sp = 2.27 + 0.131(76.6) - 0.274(24) = 5.73%
Let us average the swell values as Sp = (24.4 + 5.73)/2 = 15.1%. Since this is a large swell
percent and the stratum is 2.44 m in depth make a pressure reduction using Eqs. (7-10) and (7-13).
Using Eq. (7-10), we have
log P5 = 2.132 + 0.0208(76.6) + 0.665(1.67) - 0.0269(22.6)
= 2.132 + 2.096 = 0.226 kg/cm2
Ps = io0 2 2 6 = 1.683 kg/cm2 -> 165 kPa
Using Eq. (7-13), we can write

S'p = Sp(l - 0.0735) JFS) = 15.1(1 - 0.0735 7l65) = 0.056Sp
= 0.056(15.1) = 0.84%
AH = 2.44(0.0084)(1000) = 20.5 mm
The actual swell measured at this site ranged from - 2 5 to 159 mm, but most values were in the
range of 6 to under 50 mm (the greatest number were around 20-25 mm). Note that the wL values are
quite large for a soil with the properties indicated in the table. It may be that the liquid limit machine
was out of adjustment (a fall of, say, 8 mm versus the 10-mm standard can easily change WL by 20
or more percent). I have encountered this problem in the Peoria, Illinois, area where a consultant


obtained w//s on the order of 60 percent, where they were actually only about 35 percent. Clearly,
in this case a smaller Wi would greatly affect direct computation of A//.

7-9.5 Designing Structures on Soils Susceptible
to Volume Change
Structures built on expansive soils require special construction techniques for their founda-
tions. When the problem is identified, one may address it in several ways:

1. Alter the soil. For example, the addition of lime, cement, or other admixture will reduce
or eliminate the volume change on wetting or drying.
2. Compact the soil well on the wet side of the optimum moisture content (OMC). This
process produces a lower than maximum dry density and if the water content does not
change until the structure is built there should be little swell. Remember, it is not the
water content but the change in water content that produces soil volume change. Soils
compacted well on the wet side of the OMC are usually nearly saturated [see Gromko
(1974), with large number of references]. Often, however, this compaction state may not
have sufficient strength for the design requirements.
3. Control the direction of expansion. By allowing the soil to expand into cavities built in the
foundation, the foundation movements may be reduced to tolerable amounts. A common
practice is to build "waffle" slabs (see Fig. 7-8) so that the ribs support the structure while
the waffle voids allow soil expansion [BRAB (1968), Dawson (1959)]. It may be possible
to build foundation walls to some depth into the ground using tiles placed such that the
soil can expand laterally into the tile cavities.
4. Control the soil water. The soil may be excavated to a depth such that the excavated over-
burden mass of soil will control heave, lay a plastic fabric within the excavation, and then
backfill. The rising water vapor is trapped by the geotextile, and any subsequent volume
change is controlled by the weight of overlying material and construction. The surface
moisture will also have to be controlled by paving, grading, etc.
5. Check whether a granular blanket of 0.3 to 1 m or more depth will control capillary water
and maintain a nearly constant water content in the clay [Gogoll (1970)].
6. Ignore the heave. By placing the footings at a sufficient depth and leaving an adequate
expansion zone between the ground surface and the building, swell can take place without
causing detrimental movement.
A common procedure is to use belled piers (Fig. 7-9) with the bell at sufficient depth in
the ground that the soil swell produces pull-out tension on the shaft or the whole system
heaves. Small-diameter pipes with end plates for bearing can also be used to isolate smaller
structures from expansive soil.
The pier or pile shaft should be as small as possible to minimize the perimeter of the
shaft so that soil expansion against the shaft does not produce tension or compression
friction/adhesion stresses from vertical movement sufficient to pull the shaft apart or crush
it. Adhesion on the pier shaft can be minimized by using a slightly oversized hole or
by surrounding the shaft with straw or other porous material such as sawdust to reduce
adhesion. The foundation system movements should be stabilized by the time any organic
material used has rotted.

left in place and form the ribs, which can then be reinforced. Then the concrete is poured. Waffle forms may be of
wood or corrugated cardboard.
7. Load the soil to sufficient pressure intensity to balance swell pressures. This method is
used in many fills where the fill weight balances the swell pressure. This technique can
also be used beneath buildings either by using spread footings of high pressure intensity or
by excavating several feet of the clay and backfilling with granular material. The backfill
in combination with foundation pressures may contain the swell. This method may not
be practical for one-story commercial buildings and residences because of the small soil
pressures developed from foundation loads.
Heave of expansive soils is difficult to predict, since the amount depends on the clay min-
eralogy, particle orientation, confining overburden pressure, and the difference between the
current and reference (initial) in situ water content.
Estimates of heave may be obtained from standard 1-D consolidation tests (ASTM D 2435)
in which the sample is compressed and then allowed to rebound. The slope of the rebound
curve is related to swell.

Waffle Zone


The ASTM D 4546 method using consolidation test equipment also can be used to obtain
swell estimates. It should be used instead of D 2435 where possible since the data obtained
is more directly related to swell. Basically we can obtain a swell curve by confining the
sample in the ring using a very small confining pressure of about 7 kPa (1 psi) and allowing
it to absorb water and swell. If we measure the volume change in these conditions, we have
a free swell test. If we apply sufficient consolidation pressure to prevent the sample from
expanding, we can measure the swell pressure required to maintain the zero volume change.
These data can be directly extrapolated to the expected heave or to the footing/overburden
pressure required to eliminate, or at least reduce, the swell movements.
The resulting estimates improve with sample quality and careful attention to test details.
The estimate also improves if the current natural water content wo, and the degree of sat-
uration for the laboratory volume change, are representative of the long-term in situ value.
The latter is a very important consideration since the laboratory sample is thin and has access
to sufficient free water to obtain S = 100 percent in a short time; this may never occur in
the field, at least through the full depth id of the zone (Fig. 7-6) with potential to expand or
shrink.

7-10 FOUNDATIONS ON CLAYS AND CLAYEY SILTS
Clays and clayey silts may range from very soft, normally consolidated, to very stiff, highly
overconsolidated deposits. Major problems are often associated with the very soft to soft, de-
posits from both bearing-capacity8 considerations and consolidation settlements. We should
note that "soft" implies that the soil is very wet to saturated. Consolidation settlements occur
in these deposits with high water contents as found along lake and ocean fronts, as well as
in beds of former lakes and old streams where channels have become relocated but the water
table remains high.
Silts with a large Ip and/or Wi may be called plastic silts. These silts exhibit nearly the
same characteristics as those of soft clays. The plasticity results from contamination of the

mass with clay minerals and/or organic material. Inorganic silts and silts with little clay con-
tent may be loose, but their behavior is more that of sand, and procedures for design and
densification are similar as previously noted in Sec. 7-7. Few pure silt deposits are found in
nature. Most deposits contain some clay particles (with the resulting plasticity/cohesion) or
quantities of fine to medium sand. In passing, note that as little as 5 percent clay can give a
silt "cohesion"; 10 to 25 percent clay particles may result in the deposit being a "clay."
In both these types of soil it is necessary to make a best estimate of the allowable bearing
capacity to control a shear failure with a suitable factor of safety and to estimate the probable
consolidation settlements. The bearing capacity is most often determined using the undrained
shear strength as obtained from quality tube samples or from samples obtained from routine
SPT. If the soil is highly sensitive (remoulded shear strength one-fourth or less of undis-
turbed), consideration should be given to in situ strength testing such as the vane shear or the
cone penetration test.
Consolidation tests should be made to determine the expected settlement if the structure
has a relatively high cost per unit area. For smaller or less important structures, some type of
settlement estimate based on the index properties might be justified.
Preconsolidated clays often contain shrinkage cracks and joints (fractured into a quantity
of small blocks). The presence of structural defects makes it somewhat difficult to determine
the unconfined compression strength. In many cases, and especially above the water table
(S <§c 100 percent), the qu strength as determined on occasional intact samples from the SPT
or from using a pocket penetrometer will be adequate. If better estimates are required, it may
be possible to use plate-load tests since it is very difficult (nearly impossible) to obtain tube
samples of sufficient quality that triaxial tests can be performed. The cell pressure in the
triaxial test tends to close the fissures so that an approximation to the in situ shear strength
can be obtained. If the deposit is not overly fissured and jointed and the foundation is near
ground surface, a suitable sample may be trimmed by hand if the cost can be justified. The
immediate settlement equations of Chap. 5 can be used for settlement estimates together with
empirical values of Es if the soil is not saturated. These estimates should be adequate if the
foundation pressures are not extremely high. If a precise settlement estimate is required, it
will be necessary to obtain a reliable value of Es.
The consolidation settlement of preconsolidated clays can be estimated using consolida-
tion theory and making allowance for preconsolidation as in Example 5-14. Consolidation-
settlement estimates based on correlations are not likely to give very good results, since most
correlations are for normally consolidated clays.
The net ultimate bearing pressure for vertical loads on clay soils is normally computed as
a simplification of either the Meyerhof or Hansen equations of Table 4-1:
quit = cNcscdc + qNqsqdq - q
which is often written (after dropping sq, dq) as
#uit = cNcscdc + q(Nq - 1)
When c = 5Mwe have </> = 0 and Nq = 1.0, giving (see Example 4-4)
^uIt = cNcscdc
The combined effect of Ncscdc has a limiting value [Skempton (1951)] of about 9.0 (see
Table 14-1) for square and round footings and 7.6 for a strip footing for all D/B ^ 5.


7-11 FOUNDATIONS ON RESIDUAL SOILS
Many foundations, particularly near the Atlantic coast, in the southeastern United States, and
in parts of South America, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, and the Far East (interior
parts of southeast Asia, China, and Siberia) are founded on residual soils.
A residual soil is produced from physical and chemical weathering of rock. The rock may
be sedimentary, metamorphic, or igneous. Soils produced in this manner tend to be sandy silts
or silty sands often with some mica particles and clay contamination (depending on the rock
type undergoing weathering). The soil particles are more angular than in sedimentary de-
posits, and frequently the soil contains angular-to-subangular pebbles and larger rock pieces
that are still weathering.
Within the mass there may be layers, lenses, or zones of extremely poor material depending
on the amount of rainfall and extent of weathering. Near the soil-rock interface there may be
a zone where the soil is completely (or nearly so) saturated from water trapped on top of the
impermeable rock. Residual soil thickness varies from 0 to about 20 m depending on rock
type and climatic conditions over the geological period. These soils are usually competent
but again there are exceptions. The upper layers of these soil deposits are seldom saturated,
but at the soil-rock interface they may well have S —> 100 percent.
Some residual soils are termed laterites or saprolites. Laterite soils tend to be reddish from
oxidation of certain metallic oxides—principally iron—and are common in the southeastern
United States, South America, parts of Africa, and certain other tropical regions.
Saprolites are "soils" that still retain the initial structure and fabric of the rock but have
weathered to be so soft that they are treated as soil instead of the parent rock material. These
soils are common in the Piedmont region of the United States but also exist in other geographic
regions worldwide. Saprolites may contain so much mica that some type of improvement
program, such as compaction, may be required so that they can be used.
In any case, to make a reliable design, some soil exploration is necessary in all residual
soils. Ordinary drilling may be difficult owing to encounters with rock fragments, and some-
times a hole is abandoned and another one located a few meters away. In saprolites it may be
necessary to use rock-coring equipment to obtain samples.
For most residual soils, the sample recovery and laboratory testing methods are the same
as for sedimentary deposits to ascertain bearing capacity and estimate probable settlements.
Useful references for use in designing foundations in residual soils are Sowers (1979),
Wesley (1990), Loganathan et al. (1992), and Pandian et al. (1993).

7-12 FOUNDATIONS ON SANITARY LANDFILL SITES
As land becomes scarce near urban areas, it may be necessary to use a former sanitary landfill.
A sanitary landfill is a euphemistic name for a garbage dump. Landfill sites that are likely to
be used now were often placed at some convenient location, generally where the ground was
uneven so that the material could be placed in the depression and later covered. Present-day
landfills must be located so that groundwater pollution is controlled. Generally daily covering
of the refuse accumulation with a layer of earth is required. Good practice requires that 0.6
to 1 m of disposal material be covered with 0.15 to 0.2 m of compacted earth in alternating
layers. This goal may not be achieved owing to the practice of dumping old bedding, re-
frigerators, auto parts, demolition and construction refuse, broken-up pavements, metal cans,
and tires as well as smaller materials. In the past dumps were often left uncovered for days at a


time, creating both odor and pest nuisances. Currently, except in smaller communities, health
authorities require covering the material daily. When the landfill is closed down, the surface
should be covered with ±0.75 m of well-compacted earth and then landscaped. As the refuse
decays, the surface may become uneven or the underlying material may form cavities, de-
pending on the rapidity of decomposition (rotting), type of refuse materials, and thickness of
fill cover.
In using a landfill for later construction, it may be extremely difficult to avoid settlements
as the refuse decomposes and/or consolidates. It is certain that the settlements will be uneven
owing to the varied character of the refuse material and the method(s) used to construct the
fill. Yen and Scanlon (1975) reported several studies of landfill settlements, but no conclusive
method of predicting settlement could be made.
Determination of bearing capacity of the fill will consist in checking to see if the surface
cover has adequate thickness to avoid a punching or rotational shear failure as shown in Fig.
7-1Oa. It may be possible to add additional fill to reduce the pressure from the foundation
on the refuse zone; this procedure will speed up and increase the fill consolidation and may
be desirable for relieving future settlements if sufficient time is available. The additional fill
would be on the order of 1.5B thick to accomplish the stress reduction on the refuse zone. For
light structures such as one- or two-story residential buildings, apartments, office buildings,
and stores, where the required bearing capacity may only be 25 to 50 kPa, the use of contin-
uous foundations (with substantial reinforcing bars) may provide adequate bearing capacity
and allow bridging over local soft spots or cavities. If this is not sufficient, or the owner does
not wish to take a chance on building damage, the only recourse is to use piles or drilled piers
(caissons) through the landfill into the underlying soil.
In using piles or piers, it will be necessary to use noncorroding materials, as any mois-
ture in the fill will be contaminated by the garbage and likely to be corrosive to metal and may

even damage concrete. Generally, only treated wood or precast concrete piles can be used.
Driving the piles may be a considerable problem if paving rubble, auto bodies, or tires are
encountered.
The foundation construction may create an odor problem as the ground cover is penetrated,
and this should be investigated prior to construction as adjacent property owners may be able
to obtain a court injunction against the air pollution. Gas (usually methane) is often produced
by decay of the landfill contents. This can be an odor problem and a hazard, but also, if a
local gas user can be found, an economic advantage. A careful site exploration is required so
that the drillers are protected from gas inhalation and so that fumes are not ignited (from a
drilling spark or smoking) resulting in an explosion and possible worker injury.

7-13 FROST DEPTH AND FOUNDATIONS ON PERMAFROST
7-13.1 Considerations in Temperate Areas
Figure 7-1 shows frost-depth contours based on a survey of selected cities for frost-depth
practices at that location. Building codes may stipulate the depth the footings must be placed
in the ground so that differential movement does not take place owing to water freezing in
the ground beneath the foundation.
Differential movement is difficult to evaluate, as it depends on the amount of water, the
formation of an ice lens, and the soil density. Water expands approximately 10 percent on
freezing; thus, an ice lens in dense soil could cause a considerable amount of differential
movement.
Unlike soil expansion, controlling ice expansion is impractical for ice forces are quite large
(on the order of 2 MPa). Ice adhesion and resulting uplift can be avoided by using granular
backfill around the foundation walls or footing pedestals. With insulation [McRoberts (1982)]
it may be possible to reduce the depth of foundation or the amount of frost heave.

7-13,2 Foundations on Permafrost
Permafrost is a condition of permanently frozen ground where the ground temperatures are
never higher than 00C. This condition covers large areas of northern Canada, Alaska, most of
Siberia, northern parts of Scandinavia, and Antarctica. In many areas an active zone overlies
the permafrost, which thaws in season leaving a trapped mass of water-saturated bog, peat,
and mud overlying the ice-rich underlying soil. Construction in these areas requires that the
foundations be placed below this material and into the permafrost. It is usually necessary to
insulate the interface between structure and the permafrost so that thawing of the underlying
permafrost does not occur, either from building heat or because of changed environmental
conditions.
Where the soil is considered thaw-stable, the foundation design is the same as in temperate
regions. Thaw-stable soils are granular materials like coarse sands and gravels. These soils
will, of course, have to be of sufficient thickness that the active zone will not penetrate the
permafrost. Spread and continuous footings, mats, and beam-and-post construction can be
used. Sometimes these foundations can be used for thaw-unstable soils as well [Linnel and
Johnston (1973)]. Often the use of these foundations may require the use of a thaw-stable fill
or ducting to reduce heat transfer into the underlying permafrost.
Pile foundations are more reliable for permafrost areas but are much more expensive. They
may be necessary, however, where large differential settlements cannot be tolerated. Piles are


commonly wood, steel pipe, or HP piles. Concrete piles are less common for several reasons:
transport cost, problem of curing if cast in place, and the high tensile stresses developed from
the soil-water mixture freezing to the piles in the active zone. Pile tensile stresses on the order
of 500 kPa have been measured [Linnel and Johnston (1973)]. Piles may be driven or inserted
into predrilled holes, using a soil- or sand-water slurry that freezes around the pile to fix it in
place.
For both pile foundations and spread footings on permafrost, creep is the significant param-
eter. With creep (Sc, mm/time) the long-term settlement A//, some time Ti after construction
(and load applied) is
AH1 = 8cTi (mm) (7-14)
The present state of art on the creep factor 8C gives, at best, only a fair estimate (see Ex-
ample 16-7 of Sec. 16-11). A number of creep equations and a literature survey are given by
Sayles (1985). Lavielle et al. (1985) give a general overview of foundations on frozen ground
with references cited from the four (to that time) international conferences on permafrost.

7-14 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
Foundation engineers have the responsibility to ensure that their portion of the total design
does not have a detrimental effect on the environment. The responsibility may be enforceable
by the courts if a laxity on the part of any parties can be ascertained. Although it may not
be readily apparent, the foundation engineer does have some effect or potential effect on the
environment, for example:

1. Soil borings through sanitary landfills (which may have been constructed on impervious
soil to avoid groundwater pollution) can pollute the groundwater via seepage through the
boreholes. ASTM D 5434 might be used as a guide in drilling both in natural soil and in
sanitary landfills.
2. Soil boring logs should be checked for indication of effect of site excavation on the en-
vironment in terms of runoff, pollution in runoff, odor problems, dust, and noise.
3. One should investigate means to salvage topsoil for landscaping.
4. Pile driver noise and vibration can be objectionable.
5. Alternatives to cutting trees either for site work or where trees cause seasonal volume
changes from soil desiccation during the growth season and wetting during the dormant
season should be established.
6. Effect of soil borings on perched water tables must be identified.
7. It should be determined whether soil borings near streams cause piping problems during
high water periods. These may be avoided by careful plugging of the boreholes.
8. Hydraulic fill for cofferdams, roadway approaches, and retaining structures, usually ob-
tained from river bottoms, must not cause pollution of the groundwater through loss of
the relatively impervious silt layer in the stream bed.
9. Earth removal for fill from hillsides must not cause landslides, which may destroy scenic
areas.
10. The effect of river and marine structures on aquatic life must be minimized.


11. River and marine structures may lead to pollution of groundwater by either river or salt-
water intrusions.

Particular sites and potential site development may create environmental considerations
supplementing the preceding list.

7dry = 16.5 kN/m3 using a 3 percent lime admixture. Make tentative site recommendations for
foundation loads on the order of 800 to 1200 kN. Estimate the kgs of lime that will be required
for the soil improvement assuming that only the upper 2 m of the loess will be treated.


8-1 FOOTINGS: CLASSIFICATION AND PURPOSE
A footing carrying a single column is called a spread footing, since its function is to "spread"
the column load laterally to the soil so that the stress intensity is reduced to a value that the
soil can safely carry. These members are sometimes called single or isolated footings. Wall
footings serve a similar purpose of spreading the wall load to the soil. Often, however, wall
footing widths are controlled by factors other than the allowable soil pressure since wall loads
(including wall weight) are usually rather low. Foundation members carrying more than one
column are considered in Chapters 9 and 10. Concrete is almost universally used for footings
because of its durability in a potentially hostile environment and for economy.
Spread footings with tension reinforcing may be called two-way or one-way depending
on whether the steel used for bending runs both ways (usual case) or in one direction (as is
common for wall footings). Single footings may be of constant thickness or either stepped
or sloped. Stepped or sloped footings are most commonly used to reduce the quantity of
concrete away from the column where the bending moments are small and when the footing
is not reinforced. When labor costs are high relative to material, it is usually more economical
to use constant-thickness reinforced footings. Figure 8-1 illustrates several spread footings.
Footings are designed to resist the full dead load delivered by the column. The live load
contribution may be either the full amount for one- or two-story buildings or a reduced value

in remodeling/remedial work access to Fps units may be necessary. Also this chapter uses the standard American
Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) terminology for rolled sections as given in their AISC (1989) publication for
metric shapes based on the ASTM A 6M (SI) standard. For example, a W 360 X 79 is a rolled Wide flange shape
of nominal 360-mm depth (actual depth = 354 mm), has a mass of 79 kg/m, and is usually used as a column.

as allowed by the local building code for multistory structures. Additionally the footing may
be required to resist wind or earthquake effects in combination with the dead and live loads.
The footing loads may consist of a combination of vertical and horizontal loads (inclined re-
sultant) or these loads in combination with overturning moments. The current ACI2 Code
strength design procedure uses reduced load factors for the several transient loading condi-
tions in lieu of increasing the allowable material stresses.
A pedestal (Fig. 8-Ie) may be used to interface metal columns with spread or wall footings
that are located at the depth in the ground. This prevents possible corrosion of metal through
direct contact with the soil.

8-2 ALLOWABLE SOIL PRESSURES
IN SPREAD FOOTING DESIGN
The allowable soil pressure for footing design is obtained as the worst case of bearing capac-
ity and settlement as in Example 5-9. Where settlements control, the reported value is the net

2American Concrete /nstitute Building Code 318-. This code is revised every four to eight years. The metric version
is designated 318M-. The latest (as of 1995) was issued in 1989 and revised in 1992 [the metric version being
designated ACI 318RM-89 (Revised 1992)].

increase in soil pressure that can be allowed. The reason is that settlements are caused by
increases in pressure over that currently existing from overburden.
The allowable bearing capacity furnished to the structural designer by the geotechnical
engineer will have a suitable factor already applied. The safety factor ranges from 2 to 5 for
cohesionless materials depending on density, effects of failure, and consultant caution. The
value may range from 3 to 6 for cohesive materials, with the higher values used where con-
solidation settlements might occur over a long period of time. Note that these safety factors
are larger than those cited in Table 4-9. Geotechnical caution should not be viewed as poor
practice unless it results in a different type of foundation that is several times more expensive.
In general, reduction of qa from, say, 500 to 300 kPa will result in larger spread footings, but
the percent increase in total building cost will be nearly negligible. This can be considered in-
surance, since a foundation failure requires very expensive remedial measures and structural
repairs, whereas a superstructure failure may be localized and easily repaired.
The geotechnical consultant is not usually aware that the footing will be subjected to ec-
centric load and/or moment, so the allowable bearing pressure may not be found using the
B' analysis of Chap. 4. Also if settlement controls, there is no reliable method to account for
eccentricity. In these cases the best approach is to avoid any large differential pressure across
the base of the footing. Any footing rotation will have a marked effect on the column base
moment when the columns are rigidly attached to the footing. The footing rotation will be in
a direction to reduce the base moment and may, in fact, reduce it to zero. Equation (5-17) can
be used to estimate moment loss due to footing rotation as in Example 5-8.
Any increase in allowable soil pressure for transient load conditions should be verified
with the geotechnical consultant. Increasing qa by one-third as commonly found in design
codes for other materials may not be appropriate. Factors such as frequency of overload, soil
state, climatic conditions, and type of structure may disallow any large deviation from the
recommended qa.

8-3 ASSUMPTIONS USED IN FOOTING DESIGN
Theory of Elasticity analysis [Borowicka (1963)] and observations [Schultze (1961), Bar-
den (1962)] indicate that the stress distribution beneath symmetrically loaded footings is not
uniform. The actual stress distribution depends on both footing rigidity and base soil. For
footings on loose sand the grains near the edge tend to displace laterally, whereas the interior
soil is relatively confined. This difference results in a pressure diagram qualitatively shown
in Fig. 8-2(2. Figure 8-2fo is the theoretical pressure distribution for the general case of rigid
footings on any material. The high edge pressure may be explained by considering that edge
shear must occur before any settlement can take place. Since soil has a low rupture strength,
and most footings are of intermediate rigidity, it is not very likely that high edge shear stresses
are developed. The edge stress also depends on the thickness H of compressible soil as shown
in Fig. 8-2fe.
The pressure distribution beneath most footings will be rather indeterminate because of
the interaction of the footing rigidity with the soil type, state, and time response to stress. For
this reason it is common practice to use the linear pressure distribution of Fig. 8-2c beneath
spread footings. The few field measurements reported indicate this assumption is adequate.
Spread footing design is based almost entirely on the work of Richart (1948) and Moe
(1961). Richart's work contributed to locating the critical section for moments; critical

cohesive soils; (c) usual assumed linear distribution.
sections for shear are based on Moe's work. The ACI, AASHTO, and AREA3 specifications
for footing design are identical for locations of critical sections. AASHTO and ACI use the
same design equations and factors for strength design. AREA uses the alternative design
method for footings but allowable concrete strengths are about 10 percent less than those
allowed by ACI. Because of the similarity in the several codes the ACI code will be the
primary reference in this and the following two chapters.

8-4 REINFORCED-CONCRETE DESIGN: USD
The latest revision of the ACI Standard Building Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete
(ACI 318-), hereinafter termed the Code, places almost total emphasis on ultimate strength-
design (USD) methods. The older procedure, termed the Alternate Design Method (ADM), is
still allowed, and the basic elements are given in Appendix A of the ACI Code. The AASHTO
bridge code gives about equal emphasis to both the alternate and the strength design meth-
ods. For spread footings, even though the design is reasonably direct, the ADM procedure is
simpler to use but produces a more conservative design. When one compares designs by the
two methods the ADM will consistently compute a concrete footing thickness on the order of
15 to 25 mm larger and reinforcing bar areas 30 to 50 percent larger. For these two reasons
AASHTO gives more emphasis to the ADM than does ACI.
This text uses the ADM for the retaining wall design of Chap. 12—still a widely used
procedure in practice—since the ACI code procedure does not give greatly different results

Officials, AREA = American Railway Engineering Association.

When:


and there is much uncertainty with that design. We will use the USD for spread footing
design; however, footing depth equations [Eqs.(8-5)-(8-9)] are also applicable for the ADM.
The only difference is whether column loads are factored (USD) or unfactored (ADM).
If you have difficulty factoring column moments for a spread footing design you should use
the ADM method. You should also use the ADM where the column loads are not well-defined.
The basic procedure is given as previously stated in Appendix A of ACI 318-; select parts
and most of the methodology are given in Sec. 12-16 [basic design equations and allowable
stresses (in Tables 12-1 and 12-2)].
All notation pertaining to concrete design used in this text will conform to the ACI Code.
Where this conflicts with notation previously used, the reader should take note. Strength
design requires converting working design dead (D) and live (L) loads (see Table 4-10) to
ultimate loads through the use of load factors as
Pu = IAD + UL (a)
= 0.75(1.4Z) + UL + UW) (b)
= 0.9D + 1.3 W (alternative with wind) (c)
For earthquake loading substitute E for W (wind) as applicable. Other load combinations may
be used, but the user is referred to Art 9.2 of the Code for their application.
The ultimate concrete strength /c' in USD is reduced for workmanship and other uncer-
tainties by use of (f) factors (Art 9.3) as follows:

Design consideration <j>

Moment, without axial load 0.90
Two-way action, bond, and anchorage 0.85
Compression members, spiral 0.75
Compression members, tied 0.70
Unreinforced footings 0.65
Bearings on concrete 0.70

Concrete strain at ultimate stress is taken as 0.003 according to Art. 10.3.2, and the yield
strength fy of reinforcing steel is limited to 550 MPa (80 ksi) per Art. 9.4. The most popular
grade of reinforcing steel in current use has fy = 400 MPa (Grade 400 or 60 ksi).

ELEMENTS OF USD. For the partial development of the USD equations that follow, refer to
Fig. 8-3.
From Fig. 8-3Z? the summing of horizontal forces, X FH = 0, yields C = T, and, taking
the compressive stress block as a rectangle of dimensions shown,
C = 0.85/c'fca
The tensile force in the steel reinforcement T is
T = AJy
Equating the latter quantities yields an expression for the depth of the compression block as

Eq. (8-2) can be written as
Mu = <f>bd2fcq{\ - 0.59q) (8-2*)
The steel ratio at a cross section has been defined as p = As/bd and the ratio at bal-
anced design will be designated as pb. To ensure a tensile failure rather than a sudden con-
crete compression failure pd is taken as not over 0J5pb (Art. 10.3.3) where the balanced
reinforcement ratio is computed based on the concrete strain at ultimate stress of 0.003 and
Es = 200,000 MPa or 29 X 106 psi as

The factor /3i in the preceding equation is defined as follows:
SI: = 0i = 0.85 - 0.008(/c; - 30 MPa) > 0.65
Fps : = ft = 0.85 - 0.05(/c' - 4 ksi) > 0.65
Footings for buildings seldom use /c' > 21 MPa (3 ksi); for bridge footings /c; is not likely to
exceed 30 MPa (4 ksi), so the factor pi will, in nearly all cases, be 0.85. The lower-strength
concrete is somewhat less costly per cubic meter but, more importantly, will produce a more
rigid footing as it will have to be made thicker (larger Dc of Fig. 8-3a). Table 8-1 provides
values for /3i for a range of /c', which may be of use here and for mat design (Chap. 10), where

higher-strength concrete may be used on occasion. Also given in Table 8-1 are the several
values of 0J5pb (limiting percentage of steel at a cross section), which as shown above
depend on both f}c and fy. Adequate concrete-to-rebar adhesion (termed bond) is provided
for in Art. 12.2 by specifying the minimum length of embedment Ld for reinforcing bars in
tension depending on diameter or area as follows:

Bar code number or diameter Ld > 300mm (12 in) SI Fps
No. 35 (35 mm) and smaller C{Abfy/JJ^ Cx = 0.02 0.04

Note: /c' = MPa or psi Ab = mm2 or in2 Max. JYc = T M P a o r 1 0 ° Psi (A r t 12.1-2)
Ld = mm or in.

These development lengths should be multiplied by the following factors as applicable:

The development length for bond (Art. 12.3) for compression bars is the largest of the
following:


where A^ = bar area, mm2 or in.
db = bar diameter, mm or in.
fy = yield strength of steel, MPa or psi
/c' = 28-day compressive strength of concrete, MPa or psi

Standard hooks can be used to reduce the required value of Ld from the preceding equations
but are not usually used for footings. Hook requirements are given in Art. 12.5 of the Code.
Shear often governs the design of spread footings. The ACI Code allows shear to be com-
puted as

v» = h (8"4)
bd
where Vu is the ultimate shear force (factored working loads) and bd is the resisting shear
area of width b and effective depth d to center of tension steel. The nominal computed value
of shear vu is compared with the allowable values, which are wide-beam and two-way action4
shear defined on Fig. 8-4. The allowable values of vc are as follows:

Si = MPa psi

In most practical design cases the columns have LjB c < 2 (are often square or round with
LjBc = 1) so that vc = (f) Jf]/3 (or 4</> JJ]). The ACI Code allows shear reinforcement in
footings and it is also obvious that a higher /c' concrete would reduce or eliminate the need for
shear reinforcement. Neither of these alternatives is much used; rather, the effective footing
depth d is increased to satisfy shear requirements. This decision has the beneficial effect of
increasing the footing rigidity, so the assumption of uniform base pressure is more likely to
be obtained, as well as somewhat reducing settlement.
A minimum area of dowels of 0.005Acoi is required to anchor the column to the footing
according to Art. 15.8.2.1. Dowels are sometimes required to transfer column stress into the
footing, particularly if the column concrete is substantially stronger than the footing concrete.

4This was formerly called diagonal tension or punching shear.

Dowels are required if the column contact stress exceeds the following:
fc = 0.85*/; Jf1
The ratio A2/A1 < 2 and the cf> factor is 0.7. The area A\ is the column contact area (b X c)
or ira2/4; the area A2 is the base of the frustum that can be placed entirely in the footing as
shown in Fig. 8-4c and defined in Art 10.16.
Table 8-2 gives allowable wide-beam and two-way action shear values for several /c' val-
ues. Table 8-3 summarizes the principal ACI Code requirements particularly applicable to
concrete foundation elements (spread footings, mats, retaining walls).

8-5 STRUCTURAL DESIGN OF SPREAD FOOTINGS
The allowable soil pressure controls the plan (B X L) dimensions of a spread footing. Struc-
tural (such as a basement) and environmental factors locate the footing vertically in the soil.
Shear stresses usually control the footing thickness D. Two-way action shear always controls
the depth for centrally loaded square footings. Wide-beam shear may control the depth for
rectangular footings when the L/B ratio is greater than about 1.2 and may control for other
L/B ratios when there are overturning or eccentric loadings.
The depth of footing for two-way action produces a quadratic equation that is developed
from Fig. 8-4£, c using
2> = °
on the two-way action zone shown. Noting the footing block weight cancels, we have—valid

If we neglect the upward soil pressure on the diagonal tension block, an approximate effective
concrete depth d can be obtained for rectangular and round columns as
Rectangular: (8-8)


The approximate formulas will result in a d value seldom more than 25 mm or 1 in. larger
than the "exact" formulas of Eqs. (8-5) and (8-7).
Always use Eq. (8-7) or (8-9) for round columns to obtain the effective footing depth d
since using an equivalent square column and Eq. (8-5) gives a smaller value.
Steps in square or rectangular spread footing design with a centrally loaded column and
no moments are as follows:

1. Compute the footing plan dimensions B X LorB using the allowable soil pressure:

/Critical load combination / P
Square: B = / = / —
V 9a V 9a
P
Rectangular: BL = —
A rectangular footing may have a number of satisfactory solutions unless either B or L is
fixed.
2. Convert the allowable soil pressure qa to an ultimate value qu\t = q for use in Eqs. (8-5)
through (8-9) for footing depth

IRT = q = P q«
DLj ^design
Obtain Pu by applying appropriate load factors to the given design loading.
3. Obtain the allowable two-way action shear stress vc from Table 8-2 (or compute it) and,
using the appropriate Eqs. (8-5) through (8-9), compute the effective footing depth d.
4. If the footing is rectangular, immediately check wide-beam shear. Use the larger d from
two-way action (step 3) or wide-beam.
5. Compute the required steel for bending, and use the same amount each way for square
footings. Use the effective d to the intersection of the two bar layers for square footings
and if d > 305 mm or 12 in. For d less than this and for rectangular footings use the actual
d for the two directions. The bending moment is computed at the critical section shown in
Fig. 8-5. For the length / shown the ultimate bending moment/unit width is
M -£
1V1U ~~ rs
In Eq. (8-2) use M equals Mu if q = qu\t to obtain the amount of reinforcing bar
steel/unit width. Check the steel ratio p to satisfy Temperature and Shrinkage (T and S)
and to verify that the maximum steel ratio of Table 8-1 is not exceeded. You should be
aware that the ACI 318 has specific T and S requirements for slabs but is somewhat am-
biguous about T and S requirements for footings. The commentary R7.12.1 states, " . . .
the provisions of these sections are intended for structural slabs only; they are not intended
for 'slabs on grade.'"
Some designers would routinely put T and S steel in spread footings or mats if the top
is not covered with earth. Where the top of the footing is covered by about 400 to 500 mm

however, for convenience use bond at same section as moment.

of earth, there is enough insulation provided that changes in temperature are not wide.
Large temperature variations tend to produce tension cracks unless restrained by T and S
reinforcement. Regardless of the code, which tends to give minimum requirements, one
can always overdesign, that is, exceed any minimum code requirements.
6. Compute column bearing and use dowels for bearing if the allowable bearing stress is
exceeded. In that case, compute the required dowels based on the difference between
actual and allowable stresses X column area. This force, divided by fy, is the required
area of dowels for bearing.
It is necessary always to use a minimum of 0.005Acoi of dowel steel regardless of the
bearing stress.
If dowels are required to transfer any column load, the length must be adequate for
compression bond. The ACI318 covers the required length in Art. 12.3. If the footing does
not have a sufficient d you can put them in a spiral encasement and reduce the required
length 25 percent. If that is not adequate you will have to increase the effective footing
depth d. The use of 90° bends (whether required or not) is common, as it allows easy
attachment of the column dowels to the footing reinforcement by wiring.
7. Detail the design. At least provide enough detail that a draftsperson (or a CAD operator)
can produce a working drawing for the construction personnel.

The current ACI Code procedure as outlined in the preceding steps is based primarily on
tests by Richart (1948), which showed larger bending moments at the column face for column
strips and lesser values on other strips. Bowles (1974a, Chap. 7), using finite-difference and
finite-element analytical procedures, found that, whereas the bending moment is higher in the
column area, for finite-difference methods the average bending moment across the footing
at the section taken in Fig. 8-5 is the same as the Code procedure. The maximum computed
moment will exceed the average moment by about 30 percent for the finite-difference method
and by more than 40 percent using the finite-element method, and assuming column fixity,
which is close to reality for concrete columns attached by the Code requirement to the footing
as shown later in Example 10-4. It is implicit that readjustment will take place to reduce the
cracking effect of the column-zone moment. It may be questionable whether the 40 percent

larger moment can be adequately readjusted without possible cracking and long-term cor-
rosion effects. This problem was less severe when the alternative design method was more
popular than at present. The problem is such that one should consider the use of larger load
factors than 1AD and 1JL for footings based on the USD method. It is, of course, always per-
missible to use larger factors since any code provides only minimum values. Alternatively,
one could compute the total steel required for the side and put, say, 60 percent in a column
zone with a width of about w + 2d and the remainder in the two end zones—similarly for the
orthogonal direction.
Example 8-1. Design a plain (unreinforced) concrete spread footing (see Fig. ES-Ia) for the fol-
lowing data:
DL = 90 kN LL= 100 kN
Column : W 200 X 31.3 resting on a 220 X 180 X 18 mm base plate
[Rolled structural shape dimensions are available in ASTM A 6M or AISC (1992).] Also:
/c' = 21 MPa
Allowable soil pressure qa = 200 kPa
Solution: Note the following:

1. Plain concrete footings must be designed using ACI 318.1 "Building Code Requirements for
Structural Plain Concrete." The SI version is ACI 318.IM.
2. Unreinforced footings are only practical and economical for small column loads as in this
example.
3. We could step or taper the footing to reduce the volume of concrete slightly but at current labor
costs for the additional formwork and shaping; it is usually more economical to use a constant
depth footing.
4. Wall footings are very commonly made of plain concrete.

With these comments we will now proceed with the footing design.
Step 1. Size the footing:

(1 each side)


Step 2. Find the footing depth. For plain footings the moment requirement is usually critical, so we
will find the depth to satisfy moment and then check shear.
Convert qa to a pseudo qu\{ so we can use USD:
Puit = 1.4DL + 1.7LL
[as one load combination given in ACI 318- (Art. 9.2), which we assume controls in this example]

Pult = 1.4(90) + 1.7(100) = 296 kN qult = ^ l = ^ = 296 kPa
Aftg V
For flexure the maximum tensile stress is ft = 0.4</> JYc (ACI 318.IM, Art. 6.2.1).
For all cases the cf> factor = 0.65 for plain concrete (Art. 6.2.2). Thus,
ft + 0.4(0.65)(21)1/2 = 1.19MPa
The critical section is defined at \ distance from edge of base plate to column face (Figs. 8-5 and
8-66), which will be taken as \ distance to center of web that gives the largest moment arm Lm.
Referring to Figs. E8-lc and 8-6Z? the distance is
Lm = | _ o ^ o + o ^ o = O 4 5 5 m

Equating allowable stress ft X section modulus S = M11 and for a rectangle
S = bd2/6
Here we will use b = unit width = 1 m giving ftS = ftd2/6 = Mu = 30.64.
fd2/6 = 30.64

To this thickness d we must add 50 mm according to Art. 6.3.5 (of 318-1M) for concrete in contact
with ground, or

The average shear perimeter/? at d/2 from the column with average column dimensions of depth =

p = 2(0.215 + 0.400 + 0.090 + 0.400) = 2.21 m
The shear resistance (neglecting the upward soil pressure on this area) is
R = pdvc = 2.21(0.40X0.92 X 1000) = 813 kN » 296 (= Pult)
Step 4. We should check wide-beam shear at distance d from the critical column face.
Critical L = Lm - d (by inspection of Fig. E8-lc)
L' = 0.455 - 0.400 = 0.055 m (negligible)
For a shear force V = 0.055#uit, wide-beam shear is not critical.
Step 5. Draw a final design sketch as in Fig. E8-lc. A question may arise of whether this plain
concrete base should contain temperature and shrinkage (T and S) steel. Strictly, the ACI Code is not

clear on this point; however, if we check Art. 2.1 of 318.1, it defines plain concrete as either unrein-
forced or containing less reinforcement than the minimum specified in ACI 318. Some authorities
are of the opinion that concrete placed in the ground does not require temperature and shrinkage
steel since the temperature differentials are not large. For footings, one must make a judgment of
effects of temperature and shrinkage cracks. For this and other plain concrete footings a more con-
servative solution is obtained by using T and S steel both ways. For this problem, and referring to
ACI Sec 7.12.2.1, use
T and S reinforcement both ways = 0.002(0.4 X I)IO6 = 800 mm2 each way
From Table inside front cover try four No. 15(16 mm diam.) bars each giving
A, = 4 X 200 = 800 mm2

Four equally spaced bars satisfy maximum spacing requirements.

Example 8-2. Design a spread footing for the average soil conditions and footing load given in Fig.
E8-2a. Note the geotechnical consultant provided qa in Example 8-1; however, in this case the de-
signer preferred to select the allowable soil pressure from a soil profile provided by the geotechnical
engineer.
DL = 350 kN LL = 450 kN2/c' = 21 MPa
Use grade 400 rebars (fy = 400 MPa)
The column has dimensions of 0.35 X 0.35 m and uses four No. 30 bars (diam. = 29.9 mm, see

Solution.
Step 1. From the soil profile find qa. To start, we readily obtain qa = qu from the average qu
(SF = 3 as in Example 4-4). Estimate yciay ~ 18.00 kN/m3. So, we can include the qNq term (and
Nq = 1.0):
qa = 200 kPa + 1.2(18.0O)(I) « 220 kPa (Use 200 kPa)
Step 2. Find tentative base dimensions B using a square footing, or
P = 350 + 450 = 800 kN and B2qa = P

Step 3. Check the immediate settlement. Consolidation settlement is not a problem since the water
table is at the top of the sand at - 1 2 m. Take
E5 = 1000su since clay is stiff; su = quf2 = 100 kPa
E5 = 1000(100) = 100000 kPa
For the sand we must convert N-JO to N55 in order to use Table 5-5. Use a conservative value of
E8 = 500(N55 + 15):
Above GWT: E5 = 500[25(70/55) + 15] = 23409 kPa
Below GWT: Es = 500[30(70/55) 4- 15] = 2659OkPa
The depth of influence is taken as 5B = 10 m, which is 2 m above the 12-m depth of the boring.
Also estimate Poisson's ratio /JL = 0.35 (for the clay).
Use a weighted average E3 for the influence depth below the footing base of 8.8 m, based on
stratum thickness:

For 10/5' = 10/(2/2) = 10, we obtain (using Table 5-2)
7'" 0498 + 0 0 1 6 T T ^ W 1 = 0 - 5 0 5
For D/B = 1.2/2 = 0.6 estimate the Fox embedment factor as
lF = 0.75 (using Fig. 5-7)
Using Eq. (5-16a), we see that
1 - LL1
A// = qoB'—Z-m IsIf (and with m = 4)

= 0.00406 m -> 4.06 mm (clearly A// is not a problem.)
We can now proceed with the footing design using
B X B = 2 X 2 m and qo = 800/4 = 200 kPa < qa
We have made no allowance for soil displaced by concrete, but recall that qa « 220 kPa, which
should be sufficient.


Step 4. First find the pseudo qU[t:

Step 5. Find the depth for two-way action shear using Eq. (8-6):
d2 L + I ) + d\vc + I Y = (B2 - w2 )|
Allowable concrete shear stress vc = (f>JJ^/3 = 1.30 MPa. Substituting values g = 313.8 kPa;
vc = 1300 kPa, and w = 0.35 m into Eq. (8-6), we obtain
\318A5d2 + 509.9d = 304.2
d2 + 0.37d - 0.2207 = 0
, 0.37 ± V0.372 - 4(l)(-0.2207) -0.37 + 1.01
d = — = = 0.32 m,

The approximate effective depth by Eq. (8-8) is
Ad2 + 2(w + w)d = —
Vc
Substituting values, we obtain
4 d2 + 4(0.35) d = 4(313.8)/1300
d2 + 0.35d - 0.241 = 0
d = 0.346 m (346 mm vs. 320 mm by "exact" method)
For a square, centrally loaded footing it is never necessary to check wide-beam shear and since
column w — J it is not necessary to check ACI Eq. (11-37).
Step 6. Find the required steel for bending. We will take d as 0.32 m to the intersection of the bottom
of the top bars and the top of the bottom bars, for they will go both ways and will likely be wired
together in the shop so that either side of the resulting grid can be the "top" (refer to Fig. 8-2c).
Refer to Fig. 8-2Z? for the moment arm as defined by the ACI 318.

Use five No. 15bars/mtoprovide5x200 = 1000mm2/mof steel at a spacing of 1000/4 = 250mm.
We could use a lesser number of bars:
four No. 20 giving 4(300) = 1200 mm2/m
two No. 25 giving 2(500) = 1000 mm2/m
This latter value sets the spacing at 1000 mm which is is greater than 500 mm allowed by ACI.
A5,totai = 2 m X 1000 mm2/m = 2000 mm2 (and each way)
Use 10 No. 15 bars at spacing s: 9s + 2(70) + 16 = 2000; s= 205 mm with 10 X 200 =
2000 mm2 steel area. Now check steel ratio:

Step 7. Check if the furnished L = 0.825 - 0.07 m (clear cover requirement of Art. 7-7.1) =
0.755 m < Ld of Art. 12.2.2:
Ldb = °'°2pfy = 0.02(200)(400)/721
= 349 mm > 300 (minimum length in any case)
< 755 mm furnished
There are no multipliers to increase this computed Ub so it will not be larger than the 0.755 m
provided by the footing. Thus, the tension bar anchorage is adequate.
Step 8. Check column bearing on the footing per ACI Arts. 10.15 and 15.8. In general allowable
bearing pressure is

Inserting values, we compute the allowable bearing stress fc as
fc = 0.70(0.85)(21)(2) = 25 MPa
Check the column capacity based on a gross concrete section. If that is adequate, a refined check is
not required.

P11 = 1.4(350) + 1.7(450) = 1255 kN <=c 3062 O.K.
Step9. Design dowels. ACI318 requires a minimum area of dowels of 0.005 Acoi (Art. 15-8.2.1)un-
less a larger amount is needed to transfer compressive forces or moments. In this case the minimum
controls:
A5,doweis = 0.005(0.352) = 0.0006125 m2 = 612.5 mm2
Set four column reinforcing bars with right-angle bends onto the footing reinforcing bars and wire
them into position:
A5)furn = 4(700) = 2800 mm2 » 612.5 required
Use column reinforcing bar lengths so they either do not have to be spliced in the column zone
or will extend above the top of the footing so that the splice length of Art. 12-14 can be satisfied.
Step 10. Make a design sketch as in Fig. E8-2c.
It will be necessary to provide at least a 70-mm clear cover from the bottom of the lower re-
inforcing bar (No. 15 of diam. = 16 mm) to the bottom of the footing. This gives a total depth
of
Dc = 320 mm + 16 mm + 70 mm = 406 mm -» 410 mm
Note that the top layer of reinforcing bars requires slightly more than 960 mm2 (actually,
1000 mm2) and the lower layer requires slightly less than 960 mm2. This methodology is standard
practice, however, since it is seldom that one can obtain a bar schedule that exactly produces the
computed (or required) A5. It is not good practice to mix bar sizes to obtain exactly the required
amount of steel area.
We did not check the actual and allowable soil pressures. First, we designed the base on the
basis of using 200 kPa when we could have used about 220 kPa. This base is thin (at 406 mm), so
soil-concrete displacement pressure is negligible (about 2.3 kPa).

It will be useful to compare any cost savings by using the approximate base depth equation
[Eq. (8-8)] versus the exact equation. See the next example.

Step 1. Substitute values and obtain

Use six No. 20 bars giving 6(300) = 1800 mm2 each way:

The "approximate" depth footing is probably about $10 (US) more economical and certainly
a small amount stiffer than the "exact" depth footing. Foundations of this type are usually bid on


the basis of volume (m3) of in-place concrete (currently around $200 to $225 per m3 in-place). There
is much to recommend using Eq. (8-8) over the "exact" Eq. (8-7). This consideration will come up
later in this chapter for footings with moment.

8-6 BEAMNG PLATES AND ANCHOR BOLTS
Metal column members, including various tower-type elements, require a base plate to spread
the very high metal stresses in the small column/tower contact area at the footing interface to
a value that the footing or pedestal concrete can safely carry. The bearing plate is cut to size
in the steel fabricating shop from rolled plate stock and either shop-welded or field-bolted
to the column member. Holes 2- to 5-mm larger in diameter than the anchor rods/bolts are
shop-punched in the base plate for later attachment to the footing.
The anchor rods are usually set in nearly exact position in the wet concrete and become
fixed in place. The slightly oversized holes allow a small amount of anchor rod misalignment
when placing the base plate into position. The plate is then carefully aligned horizontally and
to elevation, and nuts are added and tightened to attach the column firmly to the footing.
The AISC (1989) specification5 provides general guidance in the design of base plates.
There is little available design material for anchor bolts aside from that provided by the sev-
eral manufacturers, which usually is limited to suggested embedment depth and allowable
anchor rod force.

8-6.1 Base Plate Design
Base plates can be designed using the AISC specification for axial-loaded columns as follows:

When the base plate covers the concrete support (typically the base plate of a pedestal is
the same size as a pedestal) the allowable bearing stress Fp is
FP = 0.35/; (a)
When the base plate covers less than the supporting concrete surface (typical for spread
footings carrying steel columns fitted with a base plate), the allowable bearing stress Fp is

Fp < 0 . 3 5 / ; ^ < 0.7/; (b)

where Fp = allowable concrete stress; must be greater than the actual bearing stress de-
fined as fp = P/A\, where P = sum of column loads acting on
footing
Ai = area of base plate in consistent units
A2 = area of supporting member; is area of pedestal when the base plate is on the
pedestal; is area of footing for other cases
A limitation is that ^ = JA2ZAi < 2.

5Baseplate methodology has changed with the last three editions of the American Institute of Steel Construction
(AISC) Allowable Stress Design manual.


If we substitute for Fp in Eq. (/?), note the limitation on JA2/A1 and square both sides, we
obtain

From the left two terms of Eq. (c) we obtain the base plate area as

*i = iMbJ <s-10)
The minimum pedestal dimensions A2 are obtained from the right two terms of Eq. (c) to
give
A2 = 4A1
which can be written by making substitution in Eq. (8-10) for A\ as

In this equation the area A2 = both minimum and optimum size of the pedestal.
We may summarize the steps in designing a base plate by the AISC (1989) specifications
as follows:

1. Find plate area Ai as the larger of

Ai= £ ( c d b ) and M = ok
You may first have to find area A2 using Eq. (8-1Oa) if a pedestal is being used.
2. Find the base plate dimensions (refer to Fig. 8-6 for identification of dimensions) BXC >
Ai and use multiples of 5 mm (integers of inches for Fps) for dimensions B, C. Also try
to make m ~ n to minimize plate thickness tp. For m, n use the following:
C - 0.95d B- 0.806/
m = - ^ - n= -
3. Compute a dimension6 n' as follows:
a. Define L = d + bf.
b. Define X = ^jf with Bowles' approximations of P = P0; Fb = Fp (plate is heavily
loaded i f Z > 0.64).
c. Define A = min 1.0, 2, . Note that A < 1. If you have a negative square root,
L i+yi-xj J & *i >
lambda is 1.
d. Compute n1 = 0.25 Jdb}.

6Here the author deviates from the AISC (1989) ninth edition manual and uses a modification proposed by one
of the AISC committee members involved with the Manual [Thornton (1990)]. Except for using A and n' the
computations are exactly as in the AISC manual.


Figure 8-6 Base plate design according to the current AISC design specifications. Symbols are consistent with
AISC (1989).

e. Extract the maximum v = max[ra, n, (Xn')]
f. Compute actual bearing stress fp = Pl(B X C).
4. Compute the base plate thickness tp as

tp = 2v ^- (units of v) (8-11)

Essentially the AISC specification requires sizing the base plate to satisfy the actual bear-
ing pressure fp. Next the plate thickness is computed based on an allowable bending stress of
0.75/*^ (Fy = yield stress of base plate steel) using a cantilever moment arm of i; and a unit
width strip of 1-m or (1-inch) equivalent. After computing plate thickness tp select a final
thickness that is available or round up to the next available plate thickness.
When there is a column moment in addition to the axial load, you must use a form of
computations as
f^sh- f
This problem is not addressed directly by AISC so you must use engineering judgment.
When there is a column moment, the base plate must be adequately attached to both the
column and the foundation. Few steel columns transmit moments to isolated spread footings,
but moments into mat foundations are fairly common.
Refer to Example 8-1 and Fig. 8-6 for the shear and moment locations for columns with
base plates. It is suggested that the approximate equation for shear depth [Eq. (8-8)] be used
for a footing supporting a base plate because of the approximation for locating the critical
section.
The previous discussion will be illustrated by a design example.

Example 8-4. Design a reinforced concrete footing with a steel W250 X 67 column (see Fig. E8-4)
using the design data of Example 8-2.

Rebar Fy = Grade 400 (400 MPa or 60 ksi)
From rolled section tables [AISC (1992)] obtain for a W250 X 67:
d = 257 mm (depth) bf = 204 mm (width)
tw = 8.9 mm (web) tf = 15.7 mm (flange thickness)

Solution.
Step 1. Find footing area. Since loads and soil pressure are the same as in Example 8-2 we have
5 = 2m.
Step 2. Since dimensions are same, use the depth d = 350 mm and the overall design of steel and
Dc = 440 mm of Example 8-3.
Step 3. Thus, we need only to size the base plate.
a. Since the base plate is clearly smaller than the footing, it is evident that the ratio W =
A2/A1 = 2 and we have Ai computed as
P 800
A l = OJf] = 0.7 x 21 x 1000 = ° - 0 5 4 4 m 2
The baseplate must fit the column footprint with about 12 mm overhang on all sides in case
it is fillet-welded to the column. Thus, tentatively try the following:
B = 204 + 25 = 230 mm (rounded) and
C = 257 + 25 = 285 mm (rounded to 5 mm)
These values yield
Ai = 0.230(0.285) = 0.0655 m2 > 0.0544 O.K.
Use B = 230 mm X C = 285 mm.

b. Find dimensions m and n:
m = 285-(f(257)= 2 ( ) .4 m m
w = 2 3 0 - a 8 0 ( 2 0 4 ) = 3 3 4 m m

To obtain kn' we must do some side computations:
Fp = 0.35/c'^ = 0.35(21)(2) = 14.7 MPa = (= 0.7/c')
L = (d + bf) = 257 + 204 = 461 mm = 0.461 m

X = min(l.O, 2 ^ )
\ i+ Vi-x/
Since X = 1.024 > 1 we have a negative root so use
k = 1.0
n' = 0.25 V257 X 204 = 57.24 mm -> Xn' = 1(57.24) = 57.24 mm
v = max(20.4, 33.4, 57.24) = 57.24 mm

c. Complete the design by selecting anchor bolts. Since there is no moment we can probably
use two anchor bolts of minimum dimension.

8-6.2 Interfacing Base Plate to Footing
So far we have considered the idealized base plate. It still must be interfaced to the footing,
the surface of which may be rough or at least rough enough that some base plate leveling
is required. Base plate leveling can be accomplished in several ways. One way is to use
shims (small, thin strips of tapered steel), which are driven between the plate and footing.
Any space remaining is grouted (see Fig. 8-7). Grouting of base plates and machinery has
received much attention; and ACI has a committee for this purpose, with the latest report
being ACI 351 (1992).
It is not an easy task to grout this gap so that the base plate fully bears on grout—often
there is uneven contact from grout shrinkage and trapped air. Holes may be drilled in the base
plate to eliminate trapped air. Once grout exits the hole there is no underside cavity.
Another method to level base plates is to use thin metal plates on the order of 5-6 mm
thick and slightly larger than the base plate with holes precut for the anchor bolts. These are
stacked as required to bring the base to the correct elevation. Again it may be necessary to
use a leveling course of grout beneath the first leveling plate for horizontal alignment.
In another method leveling nuts are used, requiring a minimum of four anchor bolts. Lev-
eling is accomplished by putting a nut on each of the anchor bolts and installing the base
plate. By adjusting the nuts vertically the base plate can be brought to level. The top nuts are
then installed and tightened. The space between the base plate and footing is then grouted.


Figure 8-7 (a) Grout space to befilledwhen frame alignment is complete. Note that an attempt has already been made to grout space
but subsequent realignment has created a new grout gap. (b) Base plate grouted using an enclosure to hold grout in position. Some excess
grout can be seen around vertical bolt in foreground and between wood containment and base plate.

Figure 8-8 Anchor bolts. Types 1 and 2 screw either into a large nut and washer or into a threaded plate to
develop pull-out resistance. Type 4 may have rebar threaded through the U to increase pull-out resistance. Type 7
may use a heavy washer or a plate bearing against the nut to increase pullout. Distances shown—E, G, L, S, and
W—are to be specified by designer.

If the base plate is not fitted to the column in the shop the base plate may be grouted into
alignment both laterally and vertically onto the footing. Then the column is fastened to the
plate during steel erection.
8-6.3 Anchor Bolts
Anchor bolts are required to attach the base plate firmly to the footing or pedestal. Figure
8-8 displays several types of anchor bolts. A number of proprietary types (not shown) are
available that work on similar principles but their advantages are mainly to provide addi-
tional vertical adjustments and thread protection during concrete placement. Most columns
and tower-type structures as well as larger machinery use anchor bolts of the type shown in
Fig. 8-8.
Anchor bolts are usually of A307 bolt material grade A (A-36 steel of Fuit « 400 MPa and
Fy = 250 MPa) or grade B(FU « 690 MPa). High-strength bolt material in A325 and A490
grades is usually not required since pullout/bond generally controls the design. Anchor bolts

fall in the 25- to 100-mm bolt diameter range. Table 8-4 gives selected bolt properties for
design use.
In practice the anchor bolt, with the nut(s) and washers attached to avoid loss and to protect
the threads, is set in the wet concrete with a sufficient length of the threaded end above the
concrete to adjust the baseplate elevation, provide a space to place a grout bed, and allow the
nut to be fully effective. To do so, the distance must be large enough for the bolt to elongate
while being tightened. Since stress always produces strain, if the anchor bolt were fixed at
the top of the concrete and only had an elongation length of the base plate + nut, it might pull
apart during the tightening operation.
What is usually done is to slip an oversized cardboard or metal sleeve over the anchor rod
so the upper 75 to 90 mm of shaft is not bonded to the hardened concrete. During tightening

soft convert values as necessary.


this length, plus the thickness of the base plate, allows elongation so that the plate can be
securely fastened. The sleeve will also allow the smaller-diameter anchor bolts to be bent to
fit the predrilled holes in the base plate if there is slight misalignment.
If a sleeve is used, it may or may not be filled with grout after the base plate is attached
and the anchor nut tightened. There are major differences of opinion on this:

1. Some think the sleeve should not be grouted so that stress reversals will produce strain
changes over a length of bolt rather than locally.
2. Some think that after the bolt is tightened to a proof load (about 70 percent of yield) no
strains of any magnitude are developed unless the moment is large enough to separate the
base plate from the grout bed.

In any case, if the sleeve is grouted, the distance to develop subsequent strains is limited
to roughly the thickness of the base plate. The question is of little importance where no stress
reversals occur because the sleeve is used only for alignment in this case and the nut is usually
made only snug-tight (about one-fourth turn from tight).
Anchor studs are available that are screwed into expanding sleeves that have been placed
in predrilled holes in the footing to a depth of 75 to 300 mm. The studs may expand the
sleeve against the concrete, or the sleeve may be driven down over a steel wedge to produce
expansion, after which the anchor is screwed in place. Anchor studs can only be tightened a
limited amount since the elongation distance is the base plate thickness. They are primarily
used for anchoring equipment into permanent position.
Base plate anchor bolts are designed for any tension and/or shear forces that develop when
overturning moments are present. Both bolt diameter and depth of embedment require anal-
ysis, although the latter is not specifically indicated in most (including ACI) building codes.
Where a column has no moment a pair of anchor bolts is used, with the size being some-
what arbitrarily selected by the designer. Some additional information on anchor bolts may
be found in Ueda et al. (1991, with references).

8-7 PEDESTALS
A pedestal is used to carry the loads from metal columns through the floor and soil to the
footing when the footing is at some depth in the ground. The purpose is to avoid possible
corrosion of the metal from the soil. Careful backfill over the footing and around the pedestal
will be necessary to avoid subsidence and floor cracks. If the pedestal is very long, a carefully
compacted backfill will provide sufficient lateral support to control buckling. The ACI (Art.
7.3 and 318.1) limits the ratio of unsupported length Lu to least lateral dimension h as

for pedestals. The problem is to identify the unsupported length Lu correctly when the mem-
ber is embedded in the soil.
The code allows both reinforced and unreinforced pedestals. Generally the minimum per-
centage of steel for columns of 0.01 Aco\ of Art. 10.98 should be used even when the pedestal

this length, plus the thickness of the base plate, allows elongation so that the plate can be

A pedestal is used to carry the loads from metal columns through the floor and soil to the
footing when the footing is at some depth in the ground. The purpose is to avoid possible

will be necessary to avoid subsidence and floor cracks. If the pedestal is very long, a carefully

stresses from moment or uplift
is not designed as a reinforced column-type element. Rather, when the pedestal is designed
as an unreinforced member, the minimum column percent steel (4 to 8 bars) is arbitrarily
added. When steel base plates are used, this reinforcement should terminate about 70 to 90
mm from the pedestal top in order to minimize point loading on the base plate.
Steel should be liberally added at the top, as in Fig. 8-9, to avoid spalls and to keep the
edges from cracking. Room must be left, however, to place the anchor bolts necessary to hold
the bearing plate and column in correct position. The anchor bolts should be inside the spiral
or tie reinforcement to increase the pullout resistance.
Pedestals are usually considerably overdesigned, since the increase in materials is more
than offset by reduced design time and the benefit of the accrued safety factor.
Pedestals can usually be designed as short columns because of the lateral support of the
surrounding soil. They may be designed for both axial load and moment, but this feature
is beyond the scope of this text. For the rather common condition of the pedestal being de-
signed as a simply supported column element interfacing the superstructure to the footing,
the following formula may be used:
Pu = 4>(O.85/C'AC + Asfy) (8-13)

where Pu = factored ultimate column design load, kN or kips
Ac = net area of concrete in pedestal (Ag — A5) for unreinforced pedestals A5 = 0.0
and Ac = total concrete area
As = area of reinforcing steel if designed as a reinforced column
fy = yield strength of rebar steel

Solution.
Step 1. We will set dimensions of the pedestal for the base plate but increase (shoulder it out) 50
mm to allow bearing for the floor slab as illustrated in Fig. E8-5<2. First, find areas A\ and A2:
^ = O l f e = 0-175 X1S5X 1000 = °-3393 ^ ( 1 0 0 ° C °n V e r t S * t0 № a )

Use a plate area Ai > 0.0848 m2 .
Use a pedestal with A2 ^ 0.3393 m2 . For the pedestal try
B2 = 0.3393 -> 5 = Vo.3393 = 0.582 m
Let us use B = 0.600 m;
A2 = 0.60 X 0.60 = 0.36 m2 > 0.3393 m2 O.K.
Looking at the column dimensions, let us try a plate of
C = d + 25 = 311 + 25 = 336 -> 335 mm
B = bf + 25 = 306 + 25 = 331 -» 330 mm
Check the furnished area, that is,

Step 4. Design anchor rods/bolts. Theoretically no anchorage is required, however, we will arbitrar-
ily use enough to carry 0.1 X P in shear:
Pv = 0.1(1425) = 142.5 kN
Use standard size bolt holes, and from Table ID of AISC (1989), obtain Fv = 70 MPa (10 ksi) for
A307 grade steel.
Using 25-mm diameter bolts, we have.
Pboit = 0.7854(0.0252)(70)(1000) = 34kN/bolt
No. of bolts required = 142.5/34 = 4.15 bolts -> use 4 bolts
Place anchor bolts in the pattern shown on Fig. E8-5c. Use anchor bolt steel of A-307 grade (or
better).

8-8 BASEPLATEDESIGNWITH
OVERTURNING MOMENTS
It is sometimes necessary to design a base plate for a column carrying moment as well as axial
force. The AISC and other sources are of little guidance for this type of design. Only a few
pre-1970s steel design textbooks addressed the problem. The Gay lord and Gaylord (1972)
textbook provided a design alternative using a rectangular pressure distribution as used in this
section. Most designs were of the (P/A) ± (McA) type but were generally left to the judgment
of the structural engineer. The author will present two methods for guidance.

METHOD 1. For small eccentricity where eccentricity ex = M/P, with small ex arbitrarily
defined as less than C/2 and C is the base plate length (dimensions B, C) as shown in Fig.
8-10. In this case we make the following definitions:
C = C- Iex
Ap = effective plate area = B X C"
Aftg = area of supporting member (footing or pedestal)
^coi = column axial load
M = column moment
ex = M/Pco\ = eccentricity
From these we may compute the following:

FAC = 0.35 / ^ * < 0.7
V AP
_ (0.35 + FAC)
Fp j * Jc

This Fp is the average allowable bearing pressure to be used for design purposes.
By trial, find the footing (or pedestal) dimensions to obtain the footing area Aftg.
By trial find the base plate dimensions so that the effective plate area

Fp depends on area of supporting member (pedestal or footing).

The assumption of a constant Fp across the effective plate area is made. If you obtain a set
of dimensions of B X C", you can compute the actual contact stress Fp a < Fp. Usually one
makes this calculation since a trial case of B X C X Fp = Pco\ is next to impossible. When
you have a case of Fp a = PC0\/(B X C) ^ Fp, you have a solution. You may not have the
"best" solution, and you might try several other combinations to obtain the minimum plate
mass. Clearly a limitation is that the plate must be larger than the column footprint by about
25 mm (1 inch) in both dimensions to allow room for fillet-welding of the column to the base
plate in the fabricating shop.
When you have found a B X C X Fp a combination that works, the X M = 0 condition for
statics is automatically satisfied. The center of the distance C is always ex from the column
center (or x axis).
Computation of base plate thickness requires using the distances m and n as in Example
8-5 except that L is not computed because it has no significance here.
A computer program (the author uses STDBASPL—one suggested on your diskette) is
most useful, as it finds several combinations of B X C that work, computes the resulting
mass, and outputs sufficient data for performing any necessary statics checks. The program
outputs the largest thickness computed. This distance is not checked against available rolled
plate thicknesses since the steel fabricator may have thicker plate stock on hand and it may
be more economical to substitute than to order a small quantity for the specific project.

Example 8-6.

Given. A W 360 X 162 (W 14 X 109) column carries a 500 kN axial load and has a moment of
100 kN-m. The footing dimensions are 1.5 X 2 m. Refer to Fig. E8-6a.
Column dimensions (from AISC, 1992): d = 364 mm (rounded to 365 mm)
bf = 371 mm (rounded to 375 mm)
Concrete fc = 24 MPa Fy = 250 MPa (base plate)

Required. Find a minimum weight (or mass) base plate.

The "actual" column dimensions are used to compute plate thickness based on m and n. Thus,

Using the larger value, we obtain the plate thickness as

tp=2mJ^=2(77>i)Vw=32-si mm
The plate weight/mass (steel mass = 7850 kg/m3 or 490 lb/ft3) is W = 0.500 X 0.450 X 0.0325 X
7850 = 57.42 kg
Summarizing, we have
Base plate: 500 X 450 X 32.5 mm
and W = 57.42 kg
The reader should verify that X Fv = 0 and that about the column centerline X Afci = 0.
Theoretically no base plate anchorage bolts are required, however, at least two 20-mm diameter
A307 grade bolts would be used in the web zone of the plate as shown in Fig. E8-6£.

METHOD 2. Base plate design for large eccentricity. When the eccentricity is such that it
falls outside one-half the depth of the column, it is necessary to resort to a different type of
solution, one that uses heel bolts in tension. The heel bolts may fall behind the heel flange
or be centered on both sides of it. The bolt pattern depends on the bolt force required for
equilibrium and the designer's prerogative. By making the bolt option part of a computer
program interactive either case can be analyzed. The general procedure is as follows (refer
to Fig. 8-11):
^Fv = T + P - R = 0 T = R - P (a)
] T Mcl = 0 = T X X7 + R X XR - M (b)
Noting that R = B(Fp)kd and substituting Eq. (a) for T9 we obtain a quadratic equation of
the form (a) kd2 + (b)kd + c = 0 from which we can solve for the depth of the rectangular
stress block kd. This approach is illustrated by the next example.

Bolts


There are two additional considerations for large eccentricity. First, the allowable bearing
stress Fp = 0.35/c'. This result must occur as part of the solution of the quadratic equation.
Second, it is always necessary to check to see whether the bolt tension force T in these equa-
tions controls the design of the base plate thickness.

Example 8-7.

Given.

Column load P = 90 kN M = 175 kN • m
Column : W 360 X 134 d = 356 mm bf = 369 mm

tial dimensions. If the resulting computed kd is outside the compression flange, that solution is not a

good one, so the trial base plate is reduced and a new trial is initiated. This process continues until a
solution is obtained where the kd zone is at least partly under the compression flange. The minimum
width is, of course, at least the width of the column + 25 mm (1 in.) rounded to an even multiple of
5 mm (or inches in integers).

Required. Design a column base plate for the given conditions. Refer to Fig. ES-Ia.

Solution. Computer program STDBASPL was again used. A solution can be obtained using
C = 550 mm and B = 450 mm
Take Fp = 0.35/c' = 0.35(21) = 7.35MPa
Convert B, C to meters -> C = 0.550 m B = 0.450 m
Define Al = T-arm = Cp.- 0.030 = 0.550/2 - 0.030 = 0.245 m
The 0.030 provides adequate edge clearance for bolts up to 25 mm in diameter (AISC, 1989) to
resist the computed T force. In this example as many as four bolts can be put into the 0.450-m width
depending on bolt diameter. Alternatively, of course, we can redefine A l = dp and use four bolts
(two on each side of the heel flange), producing the following:
R = B(Fp)kd = 0A5(1.35)kd = 3.3075&/
Arm A2 = Cp - kdp = 0.55/2 - kdp = 0.275 - kdp
] T Fy = 0 gives T = R- 90/1000 = 0
T = 3.3075JW - 0.09 (MN)
^Md = 0 = T X Al + R X A2 - M = 0 (units of MN • m)
Substituting,
(3.30751W - 0.09)(0.245) + (3.3075fo/)(0.275 - kdp) - 0.175 = 0
Collecting terms, we obtain
-1.654JW2 + 1.72OiW - 0.197 = 0
Solving for kd, we find
kd = 0.131m
Checking, we see that
R = 3.3075(0.131) X 1000 = 433.3 kN
^Fv = 0:Pcol + T-R = 0
T = 433.3 - 90 = 343.3 kN
] T Mci = 0: T X Al + R X A2 - 175 = ?
343.3(0.245) + 433.3[0.275 - .1311/2] - 175 = ?
84.1 + 90.8 - 175 = 174.9 - 175 - 0 O.K.
Find the required number of bolts and plate thickness for bending produced by bolt tension. In the
AISC (1989) text, Table J3.5 indicates we can use bolts of either 22- or 25-mm diameter. We would
simply increase the plate length if larger bolts are needed. From Table 8-5 we see that a 20P2.5
Grade B bolt can carry 169 kN for a total of 2 X 169 = 338 < 343.3 kN (but O.K.). If Grade B
bolts are not available, use alternatives of either A572 or A588 bolt material.

Plate mass - (0.45)(0.55)(0.0404)(7850) = 78.5 kg


Comments.
a. The plate mass is calculated for purposes of comparison since the thickness tp must be a value
produced by the steel mills (will probably be 45 mm).
b. This solution is adequate if bolts of required length (or end anchorage) can be obtained.
c. The 30-mm edge distance is the minimum required depending on how the plate is cut.
d. It may be possible to reduce the pedestal area beneath the base plate to the plate dimensions
unless other factors govern.
////
It should be evident that two design firms can come up with different size base plates (un-
less they are both using the same computer program) that would be considered acceptable.
It should also be evident that these designs are a mixture of "ultimate" and "working stress"
designs. It is still a common practice to use P/A ± Mc/I, giving a triangular pressure diagram
for this design. One should be aware, however, that the plate toe will always bend and redis-
tribute the compression stresses so that the rectangular compressive pressure block is more
realistic.
In most cases the overturning moment is attributable to wind, so that even though the
preceding base plate designs considered a moment clockwise about the axis of rotation, the
base plate will be symmetrically attached. That is, the same number of heel bolts are placed
in the toe region. Also, be aware that with moment the bolts must either have locking washers
or be tightened to sufficient tension not to work loose during wind (and stress) reversals. The
bolt tension produces additional compression stress in the base plate, so that the sum of the
stress from overturning and from bolt tightening may be a rather high value on the order of
0.7 to 0.8/c'. In this case the user should check stresses. It may be necessary to redesign the
base plate using 0.3/c' instead of 0.35/c'. With a computer program it is only necessary to
edit one line to change from 0.35 to 0.30/c\ Alternatively, one can simply increase the plate
dimensions—say, 30 mm for the toe, 30 mm for the heel, and 50 mm for the sides (25 mm
on each side).
Finally, note that the AISC design manual does not consider prying action for base plates,
however, it does for tee hangers and connections. You probably should consider prying action
as well for the base plate with large moment. The equation for this purpose is

where T^ = bolt force, kN (or MN) or kips
b' = \ the distance from column flange to bolt line, m or in.
p = tributary width of base plate per bolt, m or in.
Fy = yield strength of base plate, kPa (MPa if T^ in MN) or ksi

If the base plate thickness / from previous computations is less than the /bp just computed,
the thickness probably should be increased to ^p-

8-9 RECTANGULARFOOTINGS
Rectangular footings are necessary where square footings cannot be used because of space
limitations. They may be used where an overturning moment is present to produce a more

economical footing. The design is quite similar to that for a square footing. The depth will
be controlled by shear, except that wide-beam action will probably control if the L/B ratio is
much greater than 1 or where an overturning moment is present.
One other special consideration for rectangular footings is in the placement of the rein-
forcement. The reinforcement in the long direction is computed in the same manner as for a
square footing, using d to the center of gravity (e.g.) of that steel. Steel in the short direction
is computed similarly using the d to the e.g. of the steel, which is usually placed on top of the
longitudinal steel for some savings in mass and placing. Additionally, since the footing zone
in the column area is more effective in resisting bending, a specified percentage of the total
short-side steel is placed in this zone as shown on Fig. 8-12.

Example 8-8. Design a rectangular reinforced concrete footing for the following design data:
Loads: D = HlOkN L = 1022 kN (Pu = 3291.4 kN computed)
Column: fc = 35 MPa Square w/side = 450 mm

Step 2. Find the footing depth for shear. Check wide-beam value first. For a strip 1 m wide as shown

. 0.666
rf=L0l5=0-66m
For this value of d let us check the two-way action (approximately by neglecting upward soil pres-
sure on the two-way action block) to obtain
Perimeter of two-way action block = (0.45 -I- 0.66)4 = 4.4 m
Ps = perimeter X d X vc = 4.4(0.66)(1.30 X 1000) = 3775 kN > 3291.4
A more refined analysis is not required nor do we need to check ACI Eq. (11-37) since w < d. Thus
d = 0.66 m for longitudinal steel.

Step 3. Find steel required in long direction (longitudinal steel):

Checking against ACI Art 10.5.2, we see

Since p is less than required for temperature and shrinkage, use As based on 0.0018:
A5 = 0.0018(1000)(635) = 1143 mm2/m > 825
We will use 1143 but probably could use 825 mm2/m:
A5, total = 1143(4.1) = 4686 mm2
The minimum spacing of bars is 5f or 0.457 m for T & S steel. It is not necessary to check Ld or use
additional rebars in the zone B centered on the column based on the equation shown on Fig. 8-12.
Let us use sixteen 20-mm bars:
A5 = 16(300) = 4800 mm2 > 4686 and spacing O.K.
Step 5. Check bearing and design dowels:


The minimum of 0.005Acoi (Art. 15.8.2.1) will be used
As = 0.005(0.2025) X 10002 = 1012 mm2
Use four No. 25 bars (same as column):
As = 4(500 mm) = 2000 > 1013 mm2 O.K.
The depth of embedment per Art. 12.3 does not have to be checked since dowels are only for a code
requirement to ensure column-to-base anchorage. We will run the dowels using ACI standard 90°
bends (for wiring) to the top of the reinforcing bars in the bottom of the footing and wire them in
place for alignment.
Step 6. Develop the design sketch (Fig. E8-5c). Obtain overall D as

Dc > 0.66 + 5 ^ H- 0.070 = 0.7425 m
Use Dc = 0.743 m = 743.0 mm.

8-10 ECCENTRICALLY LOADED SPREAD FOOTINGS
When footings have overturning moments as well as axial loads, the resultant soil pressure
does not coincide with the centroid of the footing. If we assume the footing is somewhat less
than rigid (and most are), the application of the statics equation of

gives a triangular soil pressure and displacement zone ab\ as shown in Fig. 8-13. If #max >
#uit as shown along the toe as line IZ?, the soil pressure reduces to its ultimate value and stress
is transferred to point 2. When this gmax, 2 > <7uit the pressure again reduces to qu\u and the
process of load redistribution (similar to concrete beam analysis in Strength Design as given
by Fig. 8-3) continues until equilibrium (or failure) is obtained.

to resist P and to satisfy statics (see also Fig. 4-4). For overturning stability always take a ^ A / check about point
1 at toe.
The displacements also initially have a somewhat linear shape as shown by line ab. This
observation is consistent with concrete design where the compression zone continues to have
an approximately linear variation of strain to some "ultimate" value but at the same time the
assumed rectangular pressure block of depth a shown in Fig. 8-3fo is being produced [see
also Fig. 4-1 of ACI Committee 336 (1988)]—at least for compressive stresses that are at or
somewhat below the ultimate stress of the concrete. The equivalent of depth a of the concrete
beam is the length L' of the footing as shown in Fig. 8-13.
Meyerhof at least as early as 1953 [see Meyerhof (1953,1963)], Hansen in the later 1950s
[see Hansen (1961, 1970)], and Vesic (1975ft) have all suggested computing the bearing
capacity of an eccentrically loaded footing using Fig. 4-4 (see also Fig. 8-14). The soil analogy
is almost identical to the Strength Design method of concrete.
After careful consideration it appears that the base should be designed consistent with the
procedure for obtaining the bearing capacity. That is, use dimension B', L' for the design also.
This procedure ensures four items of considerable concern:

1. The resultant soil R is never out of the middle one-third of the base so that overturning
stability is always satisfied (taking moments about point 1 of Fig. 8-13). This R always
gives
S F = Mresist = PL_
^overturn 2M
2. The toe pressure will always be such that qioe < qa.
3. The design is more easily done when a uniform soil pressure is used to compute design
moments.
4. Approximately the same amount of steel is required as in the design using Eq. (8-14). One
can never obtain a good comparison since a footing with overturning is heavily dependent

upon the assumptions used by the structural engineer. I was able to achieve some fairly
reasonable agreements from the availability of two computer programs—one using Eq.
(8-14) and the other using the recommended procedure.

In order to satisfy the ACI 318 Building Code it is necessary to place restrictions on the
values of B\ L'. These were stated in Chap. 4 and are repeated here for convenience:
#min = 4ey + Wy B' = 2ey + Wy
^min = 4ex + Wx L' = Iex + Wx
where the appropriate dimensions are defined on Fig. 8- 14a. Note in Fig. 8-IAa that the center
of the resultant uniform soil pressure is at the centroid of the B\ Ll rectangle and is also at
the eccentric distance(s) ex or ey computed as
My Mx
6x " P 6y ~ P
from the column center.
By using dimensions of at least Bm[n and Lm[n the rectangular pressure zone will always
include the column. This allows us to take the moment arms for tension steel on the pressed
side, giving for the minimum values of B1 and U moment arms of length
Ly = B' — wy Lx = L' — wx
The amount of steel computed for a unit width is used across the full base dimensions
of B and L.
For two-way shear we have two options:
p
1. Compute an "average" q = —— and use this q value in Eq. (8-6).
BL
2. Use the approximate Eq. (8-8), which does not use the upward soil pressure in the punch-
out zone around the column. The author recommends using approximate Eq. (8-8) both to
achieve some small steel economy and to increase the base depth slightly for a somewhat
more conservative design.
8-10.1 Can a Spread Footing Carry a Moment?
It should be evident that a column can transmit a moment to the footing only if it is rigidly
attached. Nearly all concrete columns satisfy this criterion. Adequate anchorage of the base
plate to the footing must be done to transfer a moment when steel columns are used.
The question of whether a spread footing (unless very large in plan) can sustain an applied
column moment without undergoing at least some rotation according to Fig. 5-9 is a very
important one. From elementary structural analysis, if the footing rotates an amount 0, this
results in moments in the opposite direction to that being applied by the column to develop:
Near end: Mr = — — Far end: Mr = ——
LC L C
The resultant column end moments are

(with a sign on M'o)

Near end:
Far end:


Thus, any footing rotation reduces the moment Mf applied to the footing with a corre-
sponding change to the far-end moment M'r on the column. Obviously a sufficiently large
rotation can reduce the footing moment to zero (but not less than zero).9 How much rotation
is required to reduce the moment to zero depends on the EIC/LC of the column. How much
rotation actually occurs is somewhat speculative; however, Fig. 5-9 gives a quantitative esti-
mate (see also Example 5-8).
If the structural designer opts to make a rigid base analysis, it is usually done using the
following form of Eq. (8-14):

«-£K)
where terms are identified on Figs. 8-13 and 8-14. Strictly, when using this type of equation
one should include the moment from the footing weight (and any overlying soil) on the re-
sisting side of the footing axis. Doing this will reduce the maximum (toe) pressure slightly
and increase the minimum pressure. This is seldom if ever done in practice.
When the eccentricity e of Eq. (8-14) is sufficiently large, the minimum q becomes neg-
ative, indicating base-soil separation. Much effort has been expended in developing curves
and other design aids to identify the line of zero pressure for those cases where Eq. (8- IAa)
produces a negative q. Clearly, one method is to use some kind of finite element/grid com-
puter program (such as B-6 or B-19; see your diskette) and plot a line through those grid
points that after several iterations have either negative or zero displacements (and the next
adjacent nodes have positive displacements).
The principal use of Eq. (8-14a) in this text is, by rearranging the equation, to solve for
the situation where the minimum q = 0. When we set q = 0 and solve for the eccentricity
we find
e = L/6
Since the author is recommending that the base design proceed according to the same
procedure used to obtain the allowable bearing pressure, the following two examples (using
computer output from the program identified on your diskette as FOOTDES) are included.
Note that select data in these examples are hand-checked, and the procedure is exactly that
of Example 8-2. You can readily see this similarity from the sketches accompanying the
computer output, giving selected dimensions and showing some of the computed quantities
checked by hand. The only difference between Example 8-2 and Examples 8-9 and 8-10
following is that approximate Eq. (8-8) is used to obtain the effective depth d. As shown
earlier, this approximation gives a conservative depth d and results in a slight reduction in
the mass of footing steel required, thus making the footing slightly more economical at no
loss of design safety.
Example 8-9.

Given. The following load, column, footing, and soil data:
Pdes = SOOD + 80OL = 1600 kN
Puit = 1-4(800) + 1.7(800) = 248OkN

9As the moment rotates the footing, the rotation reduces the moment, which in turn reduces rotation, etc., until
some rotation equilibrium is reached consistent with moment and stiffness of column, footing, and soil.

The groundwater table is not a consideration for the design.

Required. Design a spread footing using the Hansen bearing-capacity equations and the effective
base area B' X L.

Solution. A computer program FOOTDES is used with the foregoing data as input. Note (Fig. E8-
9) that the data file used for the execution was printed (EXAM89.DTA), so if a parametric study is
made a copy of the data set can be made, renamed, and edited.
After the program found a base of dimensions 3.23 m X 2.23 m, a screen request was made if I
was satisfied with these dimensions. I decided to round the dimensions to BX = 3.25; BY = 2.25
m as shown on Fig. E8-9a. Using these fixed dimensions the program checked for adequacy and
output data indicating the base dimensions are acceptable.
Note that the computer program allowed me to modify the computed dimensions B, L so that
reasonable multiples of meters or feet (or inches) result. The program also gave me the opportunity
to limit the allowable bearing pressure.
Next the program asked if I wanted a steel design and I responded that I did. The program then
computed the allowable concrete two-way shear stress and used Eq. (8-8) to find a depth DE (d).
In this type of design wide-beam shear often controls and this was checked. In fact depth d for
wide-beam does control at 595 mm (versus 501.73 mm for two-way).
A check for overturning stability (or safety factor SF) is routinely made by taking moments about
the appropriate pressed edge. The resisting moment Mr is always

where L = footing dimension perpendicular to the pressed edge
P = either the working or ultimate column axial load
The overturning moment M0x. equals either the working design or ultimate moment producing the
edge compression. This check is shown with the output sheets.
The computer program does an internal check and always produces dimensions such that appli-
cation of Eq. (8-14«) places the eccentricity within the middle third of the base. This ensures that
the overturning stability will always be adequate, however, always make a routine check to be sure
the input is correct.
The program does not design dowels when there is overturning moment. What would normally
be done here is to use the column steel as dowels, as this would ensure an adequate column-to-
footing interface. Short column bars would either be used and later spliced above the footing at a
convenient location or, preferably, be extended the full column height. They would be bent using
a standard ACI Code 90° bend at the lower end and set onto the footing steel and wired securely.
A bend substantially increases the bar pull-out capacity if the depth d does not provide sufficient
length for a straight bar—and it often does not. The portion above the footing would be encased in
the column form or, if not convenient to do so, would be held in place using a temporary support
until the footing is poured and the concrete hardened.

Given, Same data as Example 8-9 except we have a moment about both axes (see Figure E8-10&).
Also revise the column dimensions to

AX = AY = 0.50 m

Required. Design the footing.
Solution. Again computer program FOOTDES is used. You should be aware that with equal mo-
ments about both axes the optimum footing shape will be a square.
The remainder of the design is almost identical to that of Example 8-9. Note that depth for two-
way shear again uses Eq. (8-8). The principal difference is that a square column is now used whereas
a rectangular one was used in Example 8-9, so the effective depth computes slightly less (484.86
vs. 501.73 mm).
Refer to the computer output sheets (Figure E8-10<z) for select computations or user checks.

Example 8-11. Design a footing BXL such that the soil pressure will be approximately uniform
for the following conditions (see Fig. 8.14c):
D = 419.6 kN L = 535.4 kN
Md = 228 kN • m ML = 249.5 kN • m
//D = 42.IkN HL = 53.2 kN

Column: Square 500 X 500 mm with eight No. 25 bars
/c' = 28 MPa fy = 400 MPa
Footing: /,' = 21 MPa fy = 400 MPa
qa = 15OkPa

Step 1. Find footing dimensions BxL:
P = 955 kN
M = 477.5 kN • m
M All.5 __
e = T = W=°-5 0 m
Note this ^ should be increased slightly owing to the additional overturning moment from Hd + Hi.
Use e = 0.55 m (see Fig. E8-II0).
For e = 0.55 m the edge of the column is 0.30 m from the footing centerline. The required
footing area for q = qa = 150 kPa is 955/150 = 6.4 m2. B for a square footing is 2.52 m. Try
BXL = 2.60 X 2.60 m:
1.4(419.6) + 1.7(535.4)
tfuit = 2^02 =

Step 2. Find the footing depth (refer to Fig. ES-Ub).

Do not check ACI Eq. (11-37) yet.
Find the depth for wide-beam shear at d from the column for a strip 1 m wide. We could, of
course, check d — 0.34 m, but it is about as easy to compute the required d:
d(\)(vc) = 1(1.3 + 0.30 -d)qult
Vc = 0.649 MPa = 649 kPa (Table 8-2)
Inserting values, we obtain
649d = 1.60(221.5) - 221.5d
d = 0.407 m > 0.34 (therefore, wide-beam shear controls)
Use
d = 0.410 m (Dc - 0.50 m)
Since wide-beam shear depth controls, it is not necessary to check ACI Eq. (11-37).
Step 3. Check X M about centerline using Dc = 0.50 m (Fig. 8-14c)
0.50(62.1 + 53.2) + 228 + 249.5 - 955(0.55) =?
47.7 + 477.5 - 525.3 = -0.1 (should be 0.0)
This small unbalance may be neglected, or e may be reduced and the problem recycled until ^M =
0. Alternatively, since a value of e — 0.55 is feasible, directly solve the moment equation for e to
obtain e = 0.5499 m.
With footing dimensions tentatively established, the sliding stability should be investigated as
-"resisting „ , JJ
- g p - ^ Hd + HL
Generally,
^resisting = P tan 8 + c'^footing + passive pressure
For c', 8 see Table 4-5. For passive pressure see Chap. 11.
Step 4. Find the required reinforcing bars for bending. This step is the same as for spread footings.
That is, find bars required for bending for the long dimension (be + 0.3m= 1.3 + 0.3 = 1.6 m)
and for the short dimension [(2.60 - 0.50)/2 = 1.05 m], For the long direction (length abc) run the
required bars the full length of 2.60 - 2(0.07) = 2.46 m long bars (the 0.07 m is the clear-cover
requirement).
For the short direction also run the bars the full distance of 2.46 m (the footing is square). You
might here, however, consider placing about 60 percent of the total bars required in the distance ab
and the other 40 percent in the distance be.
Use final footing dimensions


8-10.2 Eccentricity Out of the Middle 1/3 of a Footing
In Sec. 8-10.1 we noted that the eccentrically loaded footings were forced to have the eccen-
tricity
ML (^ L ^ L L\
e = —- < - we have ± - , so 2 X - = -
P 6 I o 6 3 /
This ensures that the overturning stability is adequate.
There are occasions where it is impossible to have the eccentricity e < L/6. In these cases
one has two options:
1. Increase the base dimension(s) until the eccentricity is
e = L/6
2. Make an analysis similar to the base plate design that had a large column moment. Refer
to Fig. 8-11 and replace the rectangular pressure diagram for the allowable concrete stress
with the allowable soil pressure qa. Replace the tension bolt(s) with tension piles. Solve
the resulting quadratic equation for kd and use that as B' in the bearing-capacity equations
and iterate back and forth until the assumed and required soil pressures are q < qa.
A method used by many structural designers assumes a triangular pressure distribution as
shown in Fig. 8-15. The necessary equation for this is derived as follows:
L/2 = e + Z//3 and P = ^(BL')

Substituting L' into the expression for P and solving for the soil pressure q at the toe, we
obtain
* = mlh* *q'" (8"15)
In this equation P = fixed footing load, and the allowable soil pressure for this type of pres-
sure distribution q'a is somehow estimated by the geotechnical engineer. With these values
set the structural designer solves Eq. (8-15) by trial until a set of dimensions B, L is found.
Note carefully that q'a is estimated by the geotechnical engineer. There is no current method
to compute the allowable bearing pressure for a linear variable (triangular) pressure diagram.
The solution of Eq. (8-15) is particularly difficult when there is two-way eccentricity, i.e.,
both ex and ey > L/6. This is also true when Fig. 8-11 is used for base plates since there are
two values of kd{, where now kd\ = B\ kdi = L'. Because of these difficulties in using
Eq. (8-15), the method used in Examples 8-9 and 8-10 based on Fig. 8-14 is particularly
attractive.
A finite-difference program or program B-6 (Finite Grid on your diskette) might be used
in this type of example. Steps include the following:
1. Grid the proposed base into rectangles or squares.
2. Assume or compute or obtain from the geotechnical engineer a value of modulus of sub-
grade reaction and the allowable bearing pressure qa.
3. Activate the nonlinear program option and set the maximum soil displacement XMAX
such that


Mf = moment about y axis; ex = M,/P
Mx a= moment about x axis; ey — MxJP
( + ) are shown

(Jb) Location of resultant when there is
a moment about both the x and y axes.
If both e>L/6, only part of the footing
is effective.
Figure 8-15 An alternate soil pressure profile for footings with large eccentricities.
This step ensures that, regardless of displacement (which may well be linear), the soil
will become plastic at displacement XMAX so the ultimate soil pressure is restricted. Of
course qa is less than ultimate for a safety margin.
4. If the foregoing are carefully done, you can then inspect the final computer output and
locate the line of zero soil pressure, and at least a part of the pressure diagram will be
rectangular. Alternatively, qaB'V = P, so solve by trial for B', V.
5. Use the computer output to check statics. Use the base dimensions and given loads to
check overturning stability.

8-11 UNSYMMETRICAL FOOTINGS
There are occasions where it is necessary to use a T, L, or other unsymmetrical shape for the
foundation. It may also be necessary to cut a notch or hole in an existing footing for some
purpose. In these cases it is necessary to estimate the base pressure for q < qa for the design.
For the cut base it is also necessary to check that the resulting base pressure q< qa.
The current recommendation for solution of this class of problems is to use your mat
program B6 using the finite grid method that is presented in Chap. 10. A notched base ex-
ample there considers both a pinned and fixed column. As with the footing with overturning,
the soil, base thickness, and column fixity are significant parameters that are not considered in

(a) Pressure diagram when
e>L/6.

Mx and M,


the conventional "rigid" unsymmetrical base design still used by some foudation designers.
This footing design is very computationally intensive and not recommended by the author.

8-12 WALL FOOTINGS AND FOOTINGS
FOR RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION
Load-bearing walls are supported by continuous-strip footings. Sometimes they are corbeled
out to accommodate columns integral with the wall. In these cases the columns support a
major portion of the interior floor loads; the walls carry self-weight and perimeter floor loads.
Figure 8-16 illustrates typical wall footings.
Design of a wall footing consists in providing a depth adequate for wide-beam shear (which
will control as long as d < \ X footing projection). The remainder of the design consists
in providing sufficient reinforcing steel for bending requirements of the footing projection.
Longitudinal steel is required to satisfy shrinkage requirements. Longitudinal steel will, in
general, be more effective in the top of the footing than in the bottom, as shown in Fig. 8-17.
Note that as settlement occurs in Fig. 8-17c the wall should increase the effective footing /
somewhat to resist "dishing."
Wall footings for residential construction are usually of dimensions to satisfy local building
codes or Federal Housing Administration (FHA) requirements or to allow placing foundation
walls. The contact pressure is usually on the order of 17 to 25 kPa including the wall weight.
The FHA requirements are shown in Fig. 8-18. Again longitudinal steel, if used, should be
placed in the top rather than the bottom for maximum effectiveness in crack control when the
foundation settles.
Interior footings for residential construction are usually nonreinforced and sized to carry
not over 20 to 45 kN, resulting in square or rectangular foundations on the order of 0.5 to 1.5
m. Often these footings are concrete-filled predrilled auger holes to a depth below seasonal
volume change. Additional information on foundations for residential construction can be
found in Bowles (1974ft).

Example 8-12. Design the wall footing for an industrial building for the following data. Wall load
consists in 70.1 kN/m (D = 50, L = 20.1 kN/m) including wall, floor, and roof contribution.
/c' = 21MPa fy = 400MPa
qa = 200 kPa Wall of concrete block 200 X 300 X 400 mm (8 X 12 X 16 in.)
Solution. From Table 8-2, wide beam vc = 649 kPa (no two-way action).
Step 1. Find footing width:

Since this is only 50 mm wider than the 300-mm concrete block, we will arbitrarily make the footing
project 150 mm on each side of the wall, or
B = 300 + 150 + 150 = 600 mm
We will arbitrarily make the total footing depth Dc = 400 mm (d = 400 - 80 = 320 mm). The
"pseudo" ultimate soil pressure (neglecting any weight increase from displacing the lighter soil with
heavier concrete) is

Step 2. Check wide-beam shear for the trial depth d = 320 mm. This will be done at the face of
the wall (not d out) for the most severe condition: the soil pressure equals 174 kPa and the pro-
jected length L equals 150 mm, giving Vu = qU = 174 X 150/1000 = 26.1 kN/m. The allowable
concrete shear stress is 649 kPa (from Table 8-2), and the actual shear stress for a wall length of
L = 1 m is

V° = U = 1 x 32^1000 = 8 2 № a << 6 4 9 d e p t h i s °K -
Step 3. Find required steel for transverse bending. Using meters rather than millimeters for compu-
tations to avoid huge numbers, we obtain
Moment arm L = overhang 4- \ concrete block width

L' = 0.150+ |0.300 = 0.225 m
(See Fig. 8-5/? for masonry columns.) The resulting "ultimate" moment Mu is
L2 174X0.2252 .„..-.
M11 = q— = = 4.04 kN • m/m

Since the concrete Sc = 21 and Sy = 400 MPa are the same as used in Example 8-2, we have
from that example a = 22AAs (see Step 6). Now making substitutions into the previously used
rearrangement of Eq. (8-2), we obtain (using d = 320/1000, B= 1 m, and </> = 0.9)

A(0 32~22AAS)- 4 ° 4
5 V 2 ) 0 . 9 X 4 0 0 X 1 0 0 0
and simplifying obtain A2. - 0.0286A5 = 1.Ox 10~6. Solving the quadratic, we obtain
A, = 0.035 X 10~3 m2/m = 350 mm2/m.


Step 4. Check for temperature and shrinkage (T and S) based on ACI Art. 7.12, and grade 400 bars
so that the percentage p = 0.0018. The steel area As per meter of wall length is
As = pdB = 0.0018 x 0.320 X 1.0 = 0.576 X 10"3 m2/m
= 576 mm2 > 350 and controls
Use six No. 10 bars/meter, giving A3 = 6 X 100 = 600 mm2/m > 576, OK. The spacing will be
1000/6 = 167 mm < 5 X Dc < 500 mm of ACI Art. 7.12.2.2.
Step 5. Select longitudinal steel. Since there is no moment arm, we will make an arbitrary selection
based on a minimum of T and S of 576 mm2. Let us use eight No. 10 bars as follows:
Furnished A5 = 8 X 100 = 800 mm2 > 576 for T and S
Two bars in bottom of wall footing and 80 mm (75 mm clear) above soil. These two bars will
provide support for the transverse bars being used at six bars/meter of wall.
Six bars in top part across the width of 600 mm and with 40 mm of clear cover. We are using all
the bars of same size to minimize the number of bar sizes on site and reduce any chance of installing
an incorrect bar size. The reader should check that we can get six No. 10 bars into the width of 600
mm and not violate any ACI Code spacing requirements.
Step 6. Make a design sketch like Fig. E8-12.

trim. Take snow load at 1.5 kPa. The floor plan is 9.80 X 13.8 m. Draw a building plan and place
the post at a convenient location. Comment on the design as appropriate. You must assume or

CHAPTER
9
SPECIAL FOOTINGS AND BEAMS
ON ELASTIC FOUNDATIONS

9-1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter will take up the design of several of the more complicated foundation members
such as those required to support several columns in a line or from industrial loadings. Chapter
10 will be concerned with multiple lines of columns supported by mat or plate foundations.
When a footing supports a line of two or more columns, it is called a combined footing.
A combined footing may have either rectangular or trapezoidal shape or be a series of pads
connected by narrow rigid beams called a strap footing. We will also briefly consider footings
for industrial applications, in particular the round (actually octagonal) footing widely used in
the petrochemical industry. These several footing types are illustrated in Fig. 9-1.
Combined footings similar to that shown in Fig. 9-1/are fairly common in industrial ap-
plications using wide rectangular supports for horizontal tanks and other equipment. In these
cases, operational loads, differential temperatures, cleaning operations, and the like can re-
sult in both vertical and horizontal loads. The horizontal loads at the equipment level produce
support moments that must be resisted by the combined footing.
Both the conventional "rigid" and the beam-on-the-foundation method of combined foot-
ing analysis will be presented. The latter method requires a computer program for maximum
design efficiency. A reasonably complete program for this type of analysis is included as B-5
(FADBEMLP) on your diskette.

9-2 RECTANGULAR COMBINED FOOTINGS
It may not be possible to place columns at the center of a spread footing if they are near the
property line, near mechanical equipment locations, or irregularly spaced. Columns located
off-center will usually result in a nonuniform soil pressure. To avoid the nonuniform soil pres-
sure, an alternative is to enlarge the footing and place one or more of the adjacent columns
in the same line on it (Fig. 9-2). The footing geometry is made such that the resultant of the

several columns is in the center of the footing area. This footing and load geometry allows
the designer to assume a uniform soil pressure distribution. The footing can be rectangular if
the column that is eccentric with respect to a spread footing carries a smaller load than the
interior columns. Bridge piers are also founded on very rigid combined rectangular footings.
The basic assumption for the design of a rectangular combined footing is that it is a rigid
member, so that the soil pressure is linear. The pressure will be uniform if the location of the
load resultant (including column moments) coincides with the center of area. This assumption
is approximately true if the soil is homogeneous and the footing is rigid. In actual practice it is
very difficult to make a rigid footing, for the thickness would have to be great; nevertheless,
the assumption of a rigid member has been successfully used for many foundation members.
Success has probably resulted from a combination of soil creep, concrete stress transfer, and
overdesign.
In recognition of the overdesign using the conventional (or "rigid") method, current prac-
tice tends to modify the design by a beam-on-elastic-foundation analysis. This produces
smaller design moments than those obtained by the rigid method, as will be illustrated later.
The conventional (or rigid) design of a rectangular combined footing consists in determin-
ing the location of the center of footing area. Next the length and width can be found. With
these dimensions the footing is treated as a beam supported by the two or more columns, and
the shear and moment diagrams are drawn. The depth, based on the more critical of two-way
action or wide-beam shear, is computed. Critical sections for two-way action and wide-beam
shear are the same as for spread footings, i.e., at d/2 and d, respectively, from the column
face. It is common practice not to use shear reinforcement, both for economy and so that a
larger footing thickness is required for greater rigidity. The labor costs to bend and place the
shear reinforcement are likely by far to exceed the small savings in concrete that would result
from its use.
With the depth selected, the flexural steel can be designed using the critical moments from
the moment diagram. Alternatively, the depth and loading can be used in a finite-element
analysis to obtain modified moments for the flexural steel. These beam-type members usu-
ally have both positive and negative moments, resulting in reinforcing steel in both the top
and bottom of the footing. The minimum percentage of steel should be taken as 1.4 fy since the

footing is designed as a "beam" or flexural member. Footings with negative (or top) steel are
not economical, so oversized spread footings should be used if possible.
If we compute the short, or transverse, direction bending moments as for a rectangular
spread footing, they will be in substantial error. The reason is the soil pressure is larger
near the columns, from their stiffening effect on the footing, and lesser in the zone between
columns. That zone closest to, and approximately centered on, the column is most effective
and should be analyzed somewhat similarly to the ACI Code requirement for rectangular
footings. The Code does not directly specify this effective column zone width, but based
on inspection of a number of computer printouts using both the finite-difference and finite-
element methods the author suggests that the effective zone should be about as shown in
Fig. 9-3. Note that as the width of this zone decreases its rigidity increases from the addi-
tional reinforcing bars that are required. The increased rigidity will tend to attract moment
from the zone between columns but would be difficult to predict since the moment of iner-
tia based on Dc, rather than either the transformed section or effective moment of inertia,
is commonly used in finite-element/difference analyses. Making the effective zone reason-
ably narrow should ensure adequate steel is used to take care of any additional "attracted"
moment.
The conventional design method requires computing shears and moments at sufficient
locations that a shear and moment diagram can be drawn. It is also standard practice to round
computed dimensions to multiples of 75 mm or 0.25 ft. If this is done prior to computing shear
and moment diagrams there will be a closure error that depends on the amount the length is
changed; thus, it is recommended that footing dimensions be rounded as the final design step.
The column loads are actually distributed over the column width as shown in Fig. 9-4
but should always be taken as point loads. This assumption greatly simplifies the shear and
moment computations, and the values at the critical locations are the same by either method.
It should be self-evident that combined footings are statically determinate for any number
of columns. With the column loads known and assuming a rigid footing, the resulting soil
pressure q = 2 P/A. The problem then becomes that of a uniformly loaded continuous beam
with all the reactions (the columns) known.

mum code requirements, in b satisfies both bending and minimum code requirements.

Since calculations for the conventional design of a combined footing involve an enormous
amount of busywork (with potential for errors) it is preferable to use a computer program such as
B-15 (see supplemental program list on your diskette in file README.DOC). This has been done
by the author to obtain the accompanying printout (Fig. E9-l£) to which reference will be made
with the design steps following.

checking and then selects the largest d for the design value. We see here wide-beam shear controls
giving d = 423.172 mm on the computer printout.
When wide-beam shear controls d, it may not be necessary to check ACI Eq. (11-36) or
(11-37) since the limiting value of two-way shear vc equals the wide-beam value of 2<f)JYc- It
may, however, be necessary to compare the "wide-beam" distances. That is, which is the larger
distance, the two-way perimeter of the end (or corner column) or the wide-beam width?
Here the perimeter p0 is calculated as
Po = 0.300 + 0.432 + 0.300 + 0.300 + 2(0.432)/2
= 1.764 m < B = 2.307
By ACI Eq. (11-37) the allowable two-way shear stress is:
( ^ + 2y^ = ( ^ f + 2yvz = 9.35+JTJ » M>^
With the column being square, the two-way shear stress is the smaller of these = 4</> JYc- Since
the column width w «C 4d[0.3 « 4(0.432)], it is evident that the depth will be controlled by wide-
beam shear, with the allowable vc obtained directly from Table 8-2 and using a beam width of
B = 2.307 m. It is instructive, however, for the reader to make the two-way shear check at least
one time.
Step 4. Find the steel for bending. There will be both (H-)-bending steel in the bottom of the footing
near columns and (—)-bending steel in the top near or in the center portion between columns. Note
the signs in the computer printout. The required steel area at each moment location including the
maximum (MM) is output. For convenience the program also computes the maximum allowable
amount of steel based on pb (here, 16,670 mm2, which is far in excess of the As required for the
largest moment location of 5409 mm2) and the minimum ACI Code requirement based on \A/fy,
giving 3417 mm2. Notice that the minimum of 3417 mm2 controls the bottom longitudinal reinforc-
ing bars since it is larger than any of the A^ values computed for the (+) moments. For longitudinal
steel we will use the following:
Top bars : twenty No. 20 bars (20 X 300) = 6000 mm2(5409 required)
Bottom bars : twelve No. 20 bars (12 X 300) = 3600 mm2(3417 required)
We should run all the (-) (or top) bars the full length of the footing, for trying to cut them and
satisfy Code requirements for extra length beyond the theoretical is not worth the extra engineering
and bar placing effort. We should run about one-half (six bars) of the (+) (or bottom) bars (in the
right end zone) all the way as well so that the transverse bars can be supported.
Step 5. Design the transverse steel (refer to Fig. 9-3 for the effective base widths). We will adjust
the depth d = 0.4232 - 0.038 (approximately 1.5 X No. 25 bar) giving for transverse steel a
d = 0.385 m for bending. But we will use the initial d for column zone widths.
Column 1: B[ + w + 0J5d = 0.30 H- 0.75(0.4232) = 0.6174 -+ 0.62 m
The soil pressure in this reduced zone (and rounding B = 2.31 m; L = 0.620 m) is

The resulting Mu is

For /c' = 21 MPa and fy = 400 MPa, we find that

a = a £ f e " 22AA>
The required steel area in this zone, which is 0.62 m wide, is

A,(0.385d - 22.4A./2) = 298.1/(0.9 X 400 X 1000)
11.2A2-0.385A5 = 0.000828
As = 0.00230 m2/m = 2300mm2/m
The zone width = 0.62 m, so the required A5 is
A5 = 2400(0.62/1)
= 1488 mm2 in zone
= 1412 mm2 (by computer)
Use five No. 20 bars, giving A8 = 5(300) = 1500 mm2 > 1488. With five bars there will be four
spaces, so that
s = 620/4 = 155 mm > db (Art.7.6) O.K.

A5 = 0.002 17 m2/m -• 2100 mm2/m
Here we have a zone width of 1.01, so by proportion
A, = 2100(1.01/1.) = 2121 mm2 for width (2110 computer)
Use eight No. 20 bars -> A, = 8(300) = 2400 mm2 > 2121. The spacing will satisfy ACI Art.

Use T and S steel for the remainder of the short side [p = 0.0018 since fy = 400 MPa (Art.
7.12.2.1)]. One might also consider using lA/fy of Art. 10.5. The difference is
T and S = 0.0018 1.4/400 = 0.0035
Compute the total depth (use 50 mm top and 70 mm bottom of clear cover), or
Dc = d + bottom bar/2 + 70 + top bar/2 + 50
= 432 + 10 + 70 + 10 + 50 = 572 mm

Using 0.0018 X gross area
Interior zone = 0.0018(3626)(572) = 3373 mm2
Right end zone = 0.0018(942)(572) = 970 mm2
Note: The ACI code specifies the ratio X gross area. Some designers use gross area as width X d
whereas others use width X Dc (the total depth). Clearly, using the total depth Dc is conservative.
Step 6. Check columns bearing on the base. At column 1 the area ratio JA2/Ax = 1, and will
probably require dowels to assist in transfer of column load into the footing. Column 2 has an area
ratio = 2 and should only require the minimum of 0.005Acoi to tie the column to the footing.
Step 7. Prepare a final design sketch as in Fig. E9-lc so that the final drawings can be made and
the footing constructed. Note these features:

1. Transverse steel uses a different d from longitudinal steel. Here we used 38 mm less (actual
reduction is 20 mm). The result is conservative. Note that except for the column zones, T and S
steel controls.
2. Top ( - ) steel uses the same d as (+) bottom steel.
3. Bottom steel clear distance is 70 mm (concrete poured directly on ground).
4. Top steel clear distance is 50 mm (concrete not poured on ground but may be in contact with
soil).

9-3 DESIGN OF TRAPEZOID-SHAPED FOOTINGS
A combined footing will be trapezoid-shaped if the column that has too limited a space for a
spread footing carries the larger load. In this case the resultant of the column loads (including
moments) will be closer to the larger column load, and doubling the centroid distance as done
for the rectangular footing will not provide sufficient length to reach the interior column. The

Figure 9-5 A trapezoidal footing is required in this case unless the distance S is so great that a cantilever (or
strap) footing would be more economical.

footing geometry necessary for a two-column trapezoid-shaped footing is illustrated in Fig.
9-5 from which we obtain

A - ^ L (9-1)
* - T ^ <9-2»
3 a + b
From Eq. (9-2) and Fig. 9-5 we see that the solution for a = 0 is a triangle, and if a = b
we have a rectangle. Therefore, it follows that a trapezoid solution exists only for
L , L
3 < y < 2
with the minimum value of L as out-to-out of the column faces. In most cases a trapezoid
footing would be used with only two columns as illustrated, but the solution proceeds sim-
ilarly for more than two columns. The forming and reinforcing steel for a trapezoid footing
is somewhat awkward to place. For these reasons it may be preferable to use a strap foot-
ing (next section) where possible, since essentially the same goal of producing a computed
uniform soil pressure is obtained.
With xf falling at a particular location and defining the center of area, the dimensions a
and b have unique values that require a simultaneous solution of Eqs. (9-1) and (9-2). The
value of L must be known, and the area A will be based on the soil pressure and column loads
(A = X P/qo or X Pjquit).
When the end dimensions a and b are found, the footing is treated similarly to the rectangu-
lar footing (as a beam) except that the "beam" pressure diagram will be linear-varying (first-
degree) because a and b are not equal. The resulting shear diagram is a second-degree curve
and the moment diagram is a third-degree curve. Calculus is a most efficient means to obtain
critical ordinates for these diagrams and to treat the columns as point loads. A trapezoid-
shaped footing can also be analyzed as a beam on an elastic foundation, only in this case the
finite-element widths are average values.

There is much busywork with designing a trapezoid footing, so the only practical modern method
is to use a computer program such as B-16.
Solution
Step 1. Find the end dimensions a and b of Fig. E9-2a.
First locate the center of area by taking moments through center of col. 1:
5449.2jc = 5.48[1.4(90O) + 1.7(660)]
13 053.4 ^^c J , ^ ^ 0.46
* = ^AAQi = 2 ' 3 9 5 m a n d x = 2 3 9 5 + ~^~ = 2 6 2 5 m

L = 5.48 + 2 ^ = 5.94 m
Since L/2 > x' > L/3 we have a trapezoid. From Eq. (9-1) the area is
A = <L±±L = ^ ( 5 . 9 4 )
but based on #uit and the footing loads,
A = w = 18-823m2
Equating these two A-values, we have
^±^(5.94) = 18.823 a + b = 6.338 m

From Eq. (9-2) and x' = 2.625 m,

Figure E9-2a


but a + b = 6.338, from which b = 6.338 — a and substituting for both,
2a + 6.338 - a
6338 = O 2 6 m
a = 2.065 m
b = 6.338-2.065 = 4.273 m
One should routinely back-substitute a and b into Eq. (9-1) and compare A.
Step 2. Draw shear and moment diagrams:
Pressure big end = 4.273(289.5) = 1237.03 kN/m
Pressure small end = 2.065(289.5) = 597.82 kN/m
Slope of the pressure line s = (1237.0 - 598.0)5.94 = 107.6 kN/m2
q = 1237 - 107.6JC
V= [X qdx= 1237.Ox- 107.6^ + C
Jo 2
At JC = 0.23 m, C = 0: V = 1237.0(0.23) - 53.8(0.23)2 = 282 kN
At JC = 0.23 + dx, C = -3067: V = 282 - 3067 = -2785 kN
At column 2, JC = 5.71, C = -3067: V = 2242 kN
And at JC = 5.71 + dx: V= -140 kN

Values of shear at the interior faces of columns 1 and 2 are 2509.4 and 2096.1 kN, respectively
(rounded values shown in Fig. E9-2b). The maximum moment occurs where the shear diagram is
zero (which should be somewhere between cols. 1 and 2), giving

V= ['qidxi + d =0
Jo
Integrating, inserting q and using P11 = - 3067 kN (col. 1) = Ci we obtain
V = 1237.OJC - 107.6x2/2 - 3067 = 0
Solving, we find x = 2.828 m from left end. Moments are computed similarly,
M = [X Vdx = 1237.0^- - 107.6^- - C1Jc"
Jo 2 6
At x = 0.23 and JC" = distance from previous discontinuity = 0,
M = 32.0 kN • m
At the right face of column 1,M = -576.0 kN • m. Maximum m is at JC = 2.828 m, so
M = 4946.5 - 405.6 - 3067(2.828 - 0.23) = -3429 kN • m
At the left face of column 2 , M = —479 kN • m. These values are sufficient to draw the shear and
moment diagrams of Fig. E9-2b.
Step 3. Find the depth for wide-beam shear at the small end and check two-way action at the large
end. The reasoning is


Figure E9-2b
Since the width ratio is much larger than the shear ratio, d will probably be based on wide-beam
shear at the small end.

Equating concrete shear to external shear (2.24 + 0312d)d(649) = 2096 - 641d - 53.Sd2,
295d2 + 2103d = 2096 d2 + 7Ad = 1.1 d = 0.89 m
Two-way action at the large end (not possible to check at small end) requires d = 0.75 m. Actu-
ally, when wide-beam shear "d" is used it is not necessary to check ACI two-way action since the
minimum two-way shear is 20 JJ] = wide-beam vc.
Step 4. Design the flexural steel. Since the width varies, one should check A5 for several locations,
resulting in the following table. This table was obtained from a computer printout and there are
slight discrepancies between hand and computer computations resulting from rounding for hand
computations.

The max. steel = 144.2 cm2/m (based on Table 8-1 and computer printout)
The min. steel = 29.6 cm2/m based on \A/fy

Step 5. Steel in short direction. Treat same as rectangular footing using appropriate zone of w +
0.75<i, since columns are at end of footing. Use the average width of footing in this zone for bending,
for example, at large end:
w + 0.15d = 0.46 + 0.75(0.89) = 1.12 m
Bx = 4.27 B2 = 4.27 - 1 . 1 2 4 2 7 ~ 2 < ° 7 = 3.85

The remainder of the problem is left for the reader.

9-4 DESIGN OF STRAP (OR CANTILEVER) FOOTINGS
A strap footing is used to connect an eccentrically loaded column footing to an interior column
as shown in Fig. 9-6. The strap is used to transmit the moment caused from eccentricity to
the interior column footing so that a uniform soil pressure is computed beneath both footings.
The strap serves the same purpose as the interior portion of a combined footing but is much
narrower to save materials. Note again in Fig. 9-6 that the resultant soil pressure is assumed
at the centers of both footings so that uniform soil pressure diagrams result. They may not be
equal, however.


Figure 9-6 Assumed loading and reactions for a strap footing design. Make strap width about the same as the
smallest column w.
The strap footing may be used in lieu of a combined rectangular or trapezoid footing if
the distance between columns is large and/or the allowable soil pressure is relatively large
so that the additional footing area is not needed. Three basic considerations for strap footing
design are these:
1. Strap must be rigid—perhaps /strap/footing > 2 (based on work by the author). This rigidity
is necessary to control rotation of the exterior footing.
2. Footings should be proportioned for approximately equal soil pressures and avoidance of
large differences in B to reduce differential settlement.
3. Strap should be out of contact with soil so that there are no soil reactions to modify the
design assumptions shown on Fig. 9-6. It is common to neglect strap weight in the design.
Check depth to span (between footing edges) to see if it is a deep beam (ACI Art. 10-7).
A strap footing should be considered only after a careful analysis shows that spread
footings—even if oversize—will not work. The extra labor and forming costs for this type of
footing make it one to use as a last resort. Again, it is not desirable to use shear reinforcement
in either the two footings or the strap so that base rigidity is increased.
The strap may have a number of configurations; however, that shown in Fig. 9-6 should
produce the greatest rigidity with the width at least equal to the smallest column width. If
the depth is restricted, it may be necessary to increase the strap width to obtain the necessary
rigidity. The strap should be securely attached to the column and footing by dowels so that
the system acts as a unit.
The strap dimensions to provide adequate rigidity may be most conveniently determined
using a beam-on-elastic-foundation computer program such as your diskette program B-5.
One would input sufficient data to define the footing and strap stiffness (EI/L) and the pro-
gram should have an option for no soil reactions against the strap. One then makes a solution
and checks the displacement profiles of the two footings. If they are nearly constant across the
footing, the strap is sufficiently thick. If there is a nearly linear variation of the displacements,
the strap is not rigid enough and is allowing the footing to rotate.
The equations shown in Fig. 9-6 are used to proportion the footing dimensions. The length
dimension of the eccentrically loaded footing is dependent upon the designer's arbitrarily
selected value of e, so a unique solution is not likely.
Example 9-3. Proportion a strap footing for the column spacing and loading shown in Fig. E9-3a.
The allowable pressure is 120 kPa. Both columns are 400 mm square.

Settlements should be nearly equal, since q is the same for both and the widths B are not greatly
different. It is possible an e = 1.1m could provide a closer agreement between Bi and B2, but this
is left for the reader to verify.

9-5 FOOTINGS FOR INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT
Footings for industrial applications are not directly covered by the ACI Code. On occasion
local codes may include some guidance, and certain industries may have recommended stan-
dards of practice, but often the engineer has little guidance other than what in-house design
experience may exist. These gaps in practice are sometimes filled by handbooks or by pro-
fessional committees. (ACI, for example, has over 100 committees). ACI Committee 318
is responsible for the ACI "Building Code 318-"; ACI Committee 351 is concerned with
foundations for industrial equipment. Professionals who have a mutual interest make up the
membership of these committees.
Footings for industrial application are often one of a kind; the loadings are very difficult to
define and, as a consequence, the footing is conservatively designed so that, one hopes, the
worst possible load condition (or some loading not anticipated at design time) is covered.
Footings in industrial applications often have large horizontal forces and overturning mo-
ments in addition to vertical forces. These moments are primarily from wind but may also
be from an earthquake analysis or from use. The geotechnical consultant would not know
either the moment or horizontal force at this preliminary stage, so that the allowable bearing
capacity qa is not likely to be based on footing eccentricity or any of the refined methods
of Chap. 4. (e.g., Fig. A-Ab). Rather the allowable bearing capacity is very probably a rou-
tine determination using the SPT and/or qu with some possible reduction to allow for loading
uncertainties.

Weightless strap


It would be up to the structural designer to accept the recommended qa or discuss with
the consultant whether the value should be further reduced. The designer may also wish to
discuss whether an increase may be allowed for wind, and some recommendation for the
backfill should be obtained, since this is a substantial contribution to overturning stability
and might provide some sliding stability. Two factors usually allow this procedure to work:
1. The critical loading (wind or earthquake) is transitory and represents an upper bound in
most cases.
2. The footings are usually embedded in the soil to a substantial depth so that the increase in
bearing capacity, which may not be accounted for, more than offsets any reduction from
eccentric loadings. If the center of footing area coincides with the resultant (refer to Fig.
9-Ie) there would be no reduction for eccentricity.
Sliding stability is based on a combination of base adhesion, soil-to-concrete friction, and
possibly passive earth pressure (see Chap. 11). Friction resistance depends on the total weight
of the system above the base of the footing. Generally the friction factor is tan $ but the ad-
hesion should be reduced, with values from 0.6 to 0.8c being commonly used. If the designer
includes passive pressure resistance to sliding, great care in backfilling is required so that the
perimeter zone soil can provide lateral resistance to translation.
A round base is more economical than other shapes for tall vessels, process towers, and
stacks because the direction of overturning from wind or earthquake is not fixed. A pedestal
is nearly always used to interface the metal superstructure to the embedded footing. The
pedestal is often round to accommodate the base ring, or frame, of the equipment but may be
rectangular, hexagonal, or octagonal.
In practice, however, it is difficult to form a round footing member, so an octagon is widely
used since it closely fits a circle and can be formed easily. The geometry of an octagon is given
in Fig. 9-7 together with a number of section property equations for design use.

outer radius to meet T and S requirements.

Generally the maximum eccentricity should be limited to about B/S so that the full footing
is effective for all but wind on the vessel during erection. If a turnover wind is anticipated
during erection, temporary guying can be used.
The design of an octagon-shaped foundation involves sizing the pedestal (diameter and
height) and the base. This sizing should take into account the following:
1. Empty condition with and without wind
2. Proof test condition with or without wind
3. Operating conditions with or without wind
The footing soil depth is then tentatively selected. The backfill over the footing has a con-
siderable stabilizing effect and should be included when checking for overturning stability.
The weights of the pedestal and footing slab are computed and used in combination with
the overturning from wind or earthquake to find the soil pressures at the toe and heel for the
several load cases. It is common but no longer recommended by the author to use
^ P Mc
o<J±-r^qa
Actually, one should use the equivalent rectangle of Fig. 4-4b with a rectangular soil pressure
distribution and solve for the effective footing area by trial.
Wind and/or earthquake loads are obtained from local building codes, from the client, or
from one of the national building codes such as (in the United States) the Uniform Building
Code.
The footing is checked for wide-beam shear (most likely to control) and two-way action
and for bending with sections as in Fig. 9-8. Noting that two-way action is very difficult to
analyze unless one has available curves such as Brown (1968), one can make a rapid approx-
imation by checking for wide-beam and then computing the resisting shear on the curved
section, which is first converted into an equivalent square (see step 5 of Example 9-4). If the
resisting shear is greater than 90 percent of the factored vertical loads, the depth is adequate.
If the resisting shear is less, a more refined analysis is required. At this point one must make
a decision either to increase the footing arbitrarily by 25 to 50 mm with some increase in
material costs or to refine the analysis with the resulting increase in engineering costs and a
possibility of still having to increase the depth. Also carefully note: Shear steel should not
be used, for the footing weight has a stabilizing effect on overturning. Most importantly, the
footing rigidity is needed to satisfy the linear soil-pressure assumption used in the design.
The most efficient method of round base design is to use a computer program such as B-20
(see your diskette README.DOC file), which uses a radial gridding scheme so that a grid
line can be placed at the outer face of the pedestal, which is nearly always used. This program
is set up to allow each circular grid line to have a different modulus of subgrade reaction and
to allow doubling of the edge springs. This program can iterate to a valid solution by setting
node springs that have soil-footing separation to zero. This makes it easy to locate the line of
zero pressure without resort to tables or charts and to find bending moments and shear values
at the various nodes. In passing, note that it is not a trivial task to compute critical moments
by hand when the base supports a pedestal. Moments may be under-computed by close to 30
percent if the pedestal is not considered. By trying several depths a near optimum value can
be found and the design continued.
When the footing depth has been fixed, the reinforcing steel is computed. In most cases the
minimum amount controls, but note the minimum percent (as a decimal) can be either lA/fy

(or 200/fy) or a one-third increase in the actual computed amount (ACI Art. 10-5). This steel
may be placed radially and distributed across each octagon face (Fig. 9-7). Tangential steel
based on temperature and shrinkage (T and S) requirements should be placed parallel to each
octagon face. Chu and Afandi (1966) suggest that tangential moments are not likely to exceed
0.05qoR2, so that T and S steel will usually control. Steel requirements for bending moments
are computed both for the bottom (with computations based on eccentric soil pressure) and
for the top, based on no soil pressure and the weight of backfill and footing acting with full
loss of soil pressure.
The pedestal may be hollow but is commonly solid to increase overturning stability. The
bearing between base ring and pedestal is checked using the method of Sec. 8-6 for allowable
bearing. Depending on base ring dimensions and pedestal configuration this check may set
/c' (which does not have to be same as footing) of the pedestal. The pedestal steel is designed
to provide enough steel to resist the overturning moment at the base of the pedestal. This steel

may be computed on the basis of using the section modulus of a line circle with r = radius;

The pedestal seldom requires reinforcement; however, some designers routinely use a
minimum percent steel (A5 = 0.01Aped). A cracked section analysis using reinforcement
may be required if unreinforced concrete tension stresses exceed some maximum value
[given as /, < OA<f>Jfj (50 JJj, psi), <f> = 0.65 in ACI318-1M, Art. 6.2.1]. Ifacracked
section analysis is necessary, it involves finding the neutral axis (using statics) of the pedestal;
the resulting moment of inertia of the composite section and tension stresses in the rebars.
The anchor bolts are designed to resist the tension force from the overturning moment at
the base of the vessel or stack. Equation (a) may also be used to approximate the anchor bolts.
A general overview of the design of an industrial footing is given in Example 9-4. There
is some diversity of opinion on how these designs should be made and what is too conser-
vative a design. One must weigh doubling or tripling engineering costs for a refined design
using estimated loads against material savings of perhaps 50 to 150 mm of concrete depth or
diameter change. A computer program such as B-20 is particularly useful in analyzing this
type of base for node shear, moment, and soil pressures.


Example 9-4.

Given. The following data for the design of a vertical refining vessel:
Diameter (less insulation) = 1.85 m
Insulation thickness = 0.075 m
Height of vessel above pedestal = 33.5 m
Diameter of bolt circle of base ring = 2.00 m
Weights (including anchor or base ring): Shipping = 290 kN
Operating = 580 kN
Test (proofing) = 116OkN
Allowable net soil pressure qa = 150 kPa
Unit weight y of backfill = 16.50 kN/m3
Materials f'c = 21 MPa fy = 400MPa
yc = 23.6 kN/m3
Vessel location: southern Illinois
Obtain from the Uniform Building Code (UBC, 1994 edition):

Importance factor (hazardous materials), / = 1.15
qs = 1.80 kPa (wind v = 190 kph and using UBC Table 23-F)

Required. Make a tentative design for this system using both a round base and round pedestal and
for the given UBC requirements.

Solution. Some initial computations (not shown) are used to approximate a set of dimensions for
the base, pedestal and base thickness. Clearly the pedestal will have to be about 0.15 m larger than
tower diameter to provide adequate side cover so the anchor bolts do not split out. The base will
have to be large enough to carry the tower load based on allowable soil pressure and the thickness
(of 0.70 m) is estimated based on the base diameter (refer to Fig. E9-4a).
Step 1. We will only check wind moments (although earthquake moments should also be checked,
as this site is in a zone that has an above average earthquake potential). From the Uniform Building
Code (UBC) Sec. 2316,1 we obtain the following equation for wind pressure:
Pw = ^e^q^s'

where Ce = exposure, height and gust factor (use average of (1.13 + 1.20)/2 =1.17 (using UBC
Table 23-G))
Cq = pressure coefficient for structure and for round and elliptical shapes = 0.8 (using
UBC Table 23-H)
qs = wind pressure, at the standard height of 10 m (Ce adjusts for greater heights) and
based on the anticipated wind velocity in kph (using UBC Table 23-F). For 190 kph
use2 qs = 1.80 kPa
/ = Importance factor (1.15 for hazardous materials, UBC Table 23-L)

1TlIe UBC method is quite similar to the ANSI A58-1 standard, available from ASCE as ANSI/ASCE 7-88.
2At the time this textbook was being prepared, the several available building codes had not converted to SI. The
values used by the author are soft conversions from the source and rounded.


Making substitutions, we have the average wind pressure for the tower height as
pw = (1.17)(0.80)(1.80)(1.15) = 1.94 kPa
The total horizontal wind force is computed as the projected area X qs with an increase factor to
account for tower projections of various types. The increase factor may be 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, etc.; we will
use a value of 1.0. The general equation format is
Pw = height(diam.)(increase factor)(/?w)
Substituting, we obtain the horizontal wind force as
Pw = (33.5 + 0.3)[1.85 + 2(0.075)](l)(1.94)
= 33.8(2.00)(l)(1.94) = 131.14 kN
This force acts at midheight of the tower and produces a horizontal shear at the anchor ring, as
shown in Fig. E9-4a. Strictly, the shear is at the top of the ground, but the small height of 0.3 m is
negligible, especially since the anchor ring may be between 100 and 150 mm thick.
The 131.14-kN wind load produces an overturning moment, at the top of the anchor ring, of
Mo>r = 131.14(33.5/2) = 2197 kN • m (rounded)

and, about the base (and using initial trial dimensions), of
MOtb = 131.14(33.5/2 + 0.30 + 1.50 + 0.70)
= 131.14(19.25) = 2524 kN • m (rounded slightly)
Step 2. Estimate the gravity weights of the several elements in the system that contribute to foun-
dation load. Take pedestal Bp = bolt ring diameter + 0.3 m = 2.30 m and base slab dimensions
shown on Fig. E9-4a. Concrete yc = 23.6, soil ys = 16.5 kN/m3.
Base area (from Fig. 9-7) = A = 0.828B2 = 0.828(6.60)2 = 36.1 m2
Pedestal weight = 1.50(0.828)(2.302)(23.6) = 155.IkN
Footing weight = 36.1(0.70)(23.6) = 596.4 kN
Backfill weight (excluding pedestal zone) = (36.1 - 4.38)(1.50)(16.5) = 785.1 kN
Total base weight = 1536.6 kN
The following load conditions are checked:
1. Erection weight = pedestal + footing + shipping
= 155.1 + 596.4 + 290 = 1042 kN
2. Test weight = Total base + Test weight
= 1536.6+ 1160 = 2697 kN
3. Operating weight = Total base + Operating
= 1536.6 + 580 = 2117 kN
Step 3. Check overturning stability by taking moments about the toe or leading edge (line 4-4 of
Fig. 9-8). For all case 1 gravity loads the resisting moment is at BfI from edge to give
Mr = (290.0 + 155.1 + 596.4) X 6.60/2 = 3437 kN • m
The worst case for overturning will be case 1 of tower erection onto a base without backfill. The
other two load cases are computed similarly.
Mo = wind moment about base = 2524 kN • m (from Step 1)
SF = stability number = MjM0 = 3437/2524 = 1 . 3 6
The SF is small but > 1. One might consider using some temporary guying during the erection
phase.
For working conditions (case 3) we find
Mr = (580.0 + 1537) X 6.60/2 = 6986 kN • m M0 = 2524 kN • m as before
SF = 6986/2524 = 2.77 > 1.5 (O.K.)
Step 4. Find soil pressures beneath toe and heel for cases 2 and 3.
For case 3:
e = M/P = 2524/(1537 + 580) = 2524/2117 = 1.19 m
B/S = 6.60/8 = 0.825 < 1.19.
Thus, part of the base under operating conditions appears to have soil-base separation. We will
continue (in practice I would use program B-20, described on your diskette, and check the toe for
q to see if q > qa). Here, to prevent soil-base separation would require B = 1.19x8 = 9.52 m—
clearly an overdesign.
The effective radius R of the base is (see the equations on Fig. 9-7)


The section modulus about a diameter is (also see Fig. 9-7)
Sx = 0.6906/?3 = 0.6906(3.573) = 31.42 m3
We will compute soil pressures as q = P/A ± MfSx ^ qa. Also the base and backfill weight will
be neglected, since qa is a net allowable pressure. The resulting error is the difference between the
unit weight of concrete and soil and base thickness, (yc — ys)Dc.
For load test case 2, and including only the test load + pedestal weight, we have
_ 1160+ 155.1 + 2524
q 36l ± 3L42
= 36.4 ± 80.3 = 116.7 < 150 O.K.
= -43.9 < 0 may be O.K.
Since the test load is temporary, any small overstresses would probably not be critical.
At operating conditions (case 3) we have the operating load + pedestal weight, giving:
_ 580+ 155.1 + 2524
q 361 ±?AA2
= 20.4 ± 80.3 = 100.7 < 150 O.K.
= -59.9 kPa (base only partly effective)
At this point we have the problem that with the base only partly effective, the section modulus Sx
should be revised. We will not do this, for two reasons:

1. These pressures are only for base bending moment.
2. The actual soil pressure cannot be computed this simply; that is, when the heel begins to lift
from the soil, the weight of that part of the base and overlying soil provides a resistance to soil
separation. As previously shown it would require an extremely large base diameter to reduce the
(-) heel pressure to zero using simple computations of the type used here.

Step 5. Check depth for shear.
We will find the shear value and arbitrarily apply the ACI Code LF = 1.4 (for dead loads) to
the working design loads to make them "ultimate." Alternatively, we could recompute the pressures
using some ACI factors such as 0.75(1.AD + 1.7W) or 0.9D + 1.3W, but this single factor for the
types of loads we have should be an adequate computation.

a. Check wide-beam shear: Take a 1-m wide strip at section 1-1 of Fig. 9-8 (refer also to Fig. E9-4b)
as adequate. Take d = 700 - 70 - 25 (estimated 25 mm rebar diam both radial and tangential)
to obtain a nominal design depth
d = 700 - 70 - 25 = 605 mm -» 0.605 m
The shear to be resisted is the area abed of Fig. E9~4b under the toe. The slope s of the
pressure diagram for case 2 (appears worst case) is
s = (<7toe " qheei)/B = [116.7 - (~43.9)]/6.6 = 24.3
qad = 116.7 - s(X) = 116.7 - 24.3(1.545) = 79.2 kPa
For a trapezoid pressure diagram using LF = 1.4,L = X = 1.545 m, and a width of 1 m obtain
the shear along line ad as

Concrete wide-beam resistance is vc = 0.649 MPa (Table 8-2)
V'c = vcbd = 0.649(I)(0.605)(l 000)
= 393 kN » 211.9 O.K. wide-beam
b. Check two-way action: We should check perimeter shear around arc ABC of Fig. 9-8. This arc is
often converted into an equivalent one-half square with the same area. The shear on this perimeter
is very hard to compute for the overturning case. In many cases its precise value is not necessary.
For example, if the resisting shear is larger than about 90 percent of the total vertical load, the
precise value is not needed. Let us compute the resisting two-way action shear (allowable vc =
1.298 MPa from Table 8-2). We will use an equivalent square based on a diameter of
Bp + d = 2.300 + 0.605 = 2.905 m
The equivalent side of a square with this diameter is
ss = V0.7854(2.9052) = 2.57 m
p = 2.57 + 2 X 2.57/2 = 5.14 m (one-half of two-way shear perimeter)
Two-way action shear will be based (using LF = 1.4) on
Vi = 1.4 (operating load + pedestal weight)
= 1.4(580+ 155.1) = 1029 kN

The resisting shear (include 1000 to convert MPa to kPa) is
Vr = vcpd = 1.298(5.14)(0.605)(1000) = 4036 k N » 1029

It appears the base is quite adequate for both wide-beam and two-way shear for all three load cases.
Several comments are worthwhile at this point:

1. One could make the footing thinner, but the weight gives additional stability against overturning;
thickness gives additional rigidity for satisfying the condition of linear soil pressure distribution.
2. One might consider using /c' = 18 MPa, but when concrete strengths are much less than 21
MPa (3 ksi) the extra quality control needed might cost more than the extra sack or so of cement
required for higher strength.
3. Reducing the footing thickness 0.150 m would save about 5.4 m3 of concrete but would be likely
to take an extra day to redesign the footing (especially to check two-way action shear). Obviously
the "safety" would be somewhat less with a thinner base slab.

Step 6. Find the required area of bottom reinforcing steel for bending: Take a 1-m strip to the face
of the pedestal perpendicular to line 3-3 of Fig. 9-8 (refer also to Fig. E9-4b).
Cantilever arm L = 2.15 m

For /c' = 21 MPa, fy = 400 MPa -+a = 22AAS. Using Eq. (8-2), we have

Making substitutions, we have
A(0 605-22AAS)- L 4 ( 2 2 9 - 5 )
AS\U. OUD 2 J 0 9 ( 4 0 0 ) ( 1 0 0 0 )
from which
A] - 0.0540A5 = 0.0000797
As = 1519 mmVm
Arbitrarily check the following:
T & S: As = 0.0018(1000)(605) = 1089 mm2/m < 1519
Check Min A, of \A/fy (or 200/fy) (Art. 10.5.1):
As = ^(0.605)(l)(106) = 2118mm2/m> 1519
Jy
Check Min A, (Art. 10.5.2), since \A/fy > 1519 for bending
A5 = 1.33(1519) = 2020mm2/m


From these we see that l.4fy controls, so use either A5 ^ 2118 mm2/m or A5 ^ 2020 mm2/rn. Use
four No. 30 bars (4 X 700 = 2800 mm2/rn) and place radially.
The pedestal produces a "fixed-end" rigidity such that the moment computed at the pedestal face
of 239.1 kN • m/m could be as much as 30 percent low. ACI Art. 10.5.2 was used in this analysis
to provide the required amount of steel. The Code commentary for Art. 10.5.3 states that for slabs
supported by soil the one-third increase does not apply unless superstructure loads are transmitted
by the slab to the soil. In this case the pedestal transmits the tower load to the footing, so the one-
third increase is applicable. It is preferable, of course, to use a computer program and directly obtain
the moment at the pedestal face—although the Art. 10.5.2 check would still have to be done.
Step 7. Top steel requirements (side opposite high toe pressure) are based on footing weight +
backfill and full loss of soil pressure: Moment arm is same as used in step 6 = 2.15 m, LF = 1.4,
and
2 152
M11 = 1.4(0.7 X 23.6 + 1.5 x 16.5) X - ^ - = 133.6 kN • m
Based on this small moment and from step 6 it is evident that the minimum A5 = lA/fy will control.
Therefore, use A5 = 2118 mm2/m -> seven No. 20 bars (7 X 300 = 2100 mm2/m). This steel is
required in any case, as the top steel requirements result from wind, which can come from any
direction.
Step 8. Find vertical steel for the pedestal, assuming that the rebars will carry all of the tension
stresses. Take pedestal rebar diameter Bp « 2.30 - 0.30 = 2.0 m.
Find wind moment at top of footing (refer to Fig. E9-4a):
Mu = 131.14(33.5/2 + 0.3 + 1.5) = 2433 kN • m
Using Eq. (a) previously given, including the LF = 1.4 and rearranging (the 1000 converts m2 to
mm2) we have:

= 16064 mm2 (total in pedestal)
O.OIA^ = 0.01(0.828 X 2.302)106 = 43 801 mm2
Using load factors from ACI Art. 9.2.2, \3W + 0.9D, gives
A5 = 22027 mm2 > 16064 just computed
Use 24 No. 35 bars (A5 = 24x1000 = 24 000 mm2) in the pedestal as follows (for octagon shape):
1 at each corner (uses 8)
2 at 1/3 points of each side (uses 16)
These rebars would have to be placed symmetrically, since wind can come from any direction.
The anchor bolts and tangential rebars (probably just T & S) are still to be designed but will be
left as a reader exercise. For the anchor bolts the designer would require a plan of the ring support
so that the anchorage hole positions are located.

Comment. What should one use for load factors in this type problem? Because the tower is fixed in
dimension and volume, there is not an uncertainty factor of 1.7 and probably not of 1.4. The wind
load could have a load factor of 1, because it is already estimated from a building code, and it does
not make much sense to say, 'The wind load is uncertain and may have an additional uncertainty
of 30 (1.3), 40 (1.4), or 70 (1.7) percent."

9-6 MODULUS OF SUBGRADE REACTION
The modulus of subgrade reaction is a conceptual relationship between soil pressure and
deflection that is widely used in the structural analysis of foundation members. It is used for
continuous footings, mats, and various types of pilings to be taken up in later chapters. This
ratio was defined on Fig. 2-43c, and the basic equation when using plate-load test data is
kks - ±
~ 8
with terms identified on both Fig. 2-43c and Fig. 9-9b. Plots of q versus S from load tests
give curves of the type qualitatively shown in Fig. 9-9b. If this type of curve is used to obtain
ks in the preceding equation, it is evident that the value depends on whether it is a tangent or
secant modulus and on the location of the coordinates of q and S.
It is difficult to make a plate-load test except for very small plates because of the reaction
load required. Even with small plates of, say, 450-, 600-, and 750-mm diameter it is difficult
to obtain 8 since the plate tends to be less than rigid so that a constant deflection across the
plate (and definition of ks) is difficult to obtain. Stacking the smaller plates concentric with
the larger ones tends to increase the rigidity, but in any case the plot is of load divided by
plate contact area (nominal P/A) and the average measured deflection.
Figure 9-9c is a representation of ks used by the author where ks is taken as a constant up
to a deflection Xmax. Beyond Xmax the soil pressure is a constant value defined by
#con = ^sv^max)
Obviously one could divide the q-8 curve into several regions so that ks takes on val-
ues of the slope in the several regions; however, this approach tends to incorporate too much

refinement into the problem since most analyses proceed on the basis of estimated values or
at best an approximate load test.
A number of persons do not like to use the concept of a modulus of subgrade reaction;
rather, they prefer to use Es (and fx) in some kind of finite-element analysis. The author's
experience using both the finite element (of the elastic continuum) and the concept of the
modulus of subgrade reaction is that, until the state of the art improves so that accurate val-
ues of Es can be obtained, the modulus of subgrade reaction method is preferable owing to
its greater ease of use and to the substantial savings in computer computation time. In the
following paragraphs we will see a direct relationship between Es and ks.
A major problem is to estimate the numerical value of ks. One of the early contributions
was that of Terzaghi (1955), who proposed that ks for full-sized footings could be obtained
from plate-load tests using the following equations:
For footings on clay3

For footings on sand (and including size effects)

In these two equations use B\ = side dimension of the square base used in the load test to
produce k\. In most cases B\ — 0.3 m (or 1 ft), but whatever B\ dimension was used should
be input. Also this equation deteriorates when B/B\ ~ > 3.
For a rectangular footing on stiff clay or medium dense sand with dimensions of B X L
with m = L/B,

where ks = desired value of modulus of subgrade reaction for the full-size (or prototype)
foundation
k\ = value obtained from a plate-load test using a 0.3 X 0.3 m (1 X 1 ft) or other
size load plate

Equations (9-3), (9-4), and (9-5) are presented primarily for historical purposes and are
not recommended by the author for general use.
Vesic (1961«, 196Ib) proposed that the modulus of subgrade reaction could be computed
using the stress-strain modulus Es as
k's = 0.65 n ^ r — ^ (units of E5) (9-6)
Y EfIf 1 — JXZ

3The B

x is not usually seen in this equation, since at the time it was proposed by Terzaghi (1955) only Fps units
were used, and with Bx — 1 ft it did not need to be shown. The equation is dimensionally incorrect, however,
without including B1. Equation (9-3) is not correct in any case, as ks using a 3.0 m footing would not be -^ the
value obtained from a Bx = 0.3 m plate.


where E5, Ef = modulus of soil and footing, respectively, in consistent units
B, If = footing width and its moment of inertia based on cross section (not plan)
in consistent units

One can obtain ks from k's as

ks~ ~B
Since the twelfth root of any value X 0.65 will be close to 1, for all practical purposes the
Vesic equation reduces to

One may rearrange Eq. (5-16«) and, using E's = (1 - /JL2)/ES as in Eqs. (5-18) and (5-19)
and m = 1, obtain
AH = AqBE'slsIF
and, since ks is defined as Aq/AH, obtain
k ~ Aq ~ l (9 1)

but carefully note the definition of E's. Now one can correctly incorporate the size effects that
are a major concern—particularly for the mat foundations of the next chapter. As for Eqs.
(5-18) and (5-19), we can write a ks ratio from Eq. (9-7) as follows:

Equation (9-8) should be used instead of Eqs. (9-3) through (9-5), and Eq. (9-7) is at least as
theoretically founded as Eq. (9-6). Carefully note in using these equations that their basis is
in the settlement equation [Eq. (5-16a)] of Chap. 5, and use B, Is, and Ip as defined there.
Equations (9-7) and (9-8) show a direct relationship between ks and Es. Since one does
not often have values of Es, other approximations are useful and often quite satisfactory if the
computed deflection (directly dependent on ks) can be tolerated for any reasonable value. It
has been found that bending moments and the computed soil pressure are not very sensitive
to what is used for ks because the structural member stiffness is usually 10 or more times
as great as the soil stiffness as defined by ks. Recognizing this, the author has suggested
the following for approximating ks from the allowable bearing capacity qa furnished by the
geotechnical consultant:
SI: ks = 40(SF)^ kN/m3
Fps: ks = l2(S¥)qa k/ft3 (9-9)
where qa is furnished in ksf or kPa. This equation is based on qa = qu\t/SF and the ultimate
soil pressure is at a settlement A// = 0.0254 m or 1 in. (1/12 ft) and ks is q^AH. For
AH = 6, 12, 20 mm, etc., the factor 40 (or 12) can be adjusted to 160 (or 48), 83 (or 24), 50
(or 16), etc.; 40 is reasonably conservative but smaller assumed displacements can always
be used.


The most general form for either a horizontal or lateral modulus of subgrade reaction is
ks = As + BsZn (9-10)
where A5 = constant for either horizontal or vertical members
Bs = coefficient for depth variation
Z = depth of interest below ground
n = exponent to give ks the best fit (if load test or other data are available)

Either As or Bs in this equation may be zero; at the ground surface As is zero for a lateral ks
but at any small depth As > 0. For footings and mats (plates in general), As > 0 and Bs = 0.
Equation (9-10) can be used with the proper interpretation of the bearing-capacity equa-
tions of Table 4-1 (with the dt factors dropped) to give
tfuit = cNcsc + yZNqsq + 0.5y BN7S7) (9-10«)
Observing that
As = C(cNcsc + 0.5yBNySy) and BSZX = C(yNqsq)Zl
we obtain a ready means to estimate ks. In these equations the Terzaghi or Hansen bearing-
capacity factors can be used. The C factor is 40 for SI units and 12 for Fps, using the same
reasoning that qu\t occurs at a 0.0254-m and 1-in. settlement but with no SF, since this equa-
tion directly gives qu\t. Where there is concern that ks does not increase without bound with
depth Z, we may adjust the B8Z term by one of two simple methods:
Method 1: S^ tan"1 —
Method 2: ^-Zn = B'sZn
Dn
where D = maximum depth of interest, say, the length of a pile
Z = current depth of interest
n = your best estimate of the exponent

Table 9-1 may be used to estimate a value of ks to determine the correct order of magnitude
of the subgrade modulus obtained using one of the approximations given here. Obviously if a
computed value is two or three times larger than the table range indicates, the computations
should be rechecked for a possible gross error. Note, however, if you use a reduced value of
displacement (say, 6 mm or 12 mm) instead of 0.0254 m you may well exceed the table range.
Other than this, if no computational error (or a poor assumption) is found then use judgment
in what value to use. The table values are intended as guides. The reader should not use, say,
an average of the range given as a "good" estimate.
The value of Xmax used in Fig. 9-9c (and used in your diskette program FADBEMLP as
XMAX) may be directly estimated at some small value of, say, 6 to 25 mm, or from inspection
of a load-settlement curve if a load test was done. It might also be estimated from a triaxial
test using the strain at "ultimate" or at the maximum pressure from the stress-strain plot.
Using the selected strain emax compute

The 1.5 to 2B dimension is an approximation of the depth of significant stress-strain in-
fluence (Boussinesq theory) for the structural member. The structural member may be either
a footing or a pile.

Example 9-5. Estimate the modulus of subgrade reaction ks for the following design parameters:
B = 1.22 m L = 1.83 m D = 0.610 m
qa = 200 kPa (clayey sand approximately 10 m deep)
Es = 11.72 MPa (average in depth 5B below base)

Solution. Estimate Poisson's ratio /x, = 0.30 so that
K = l-^ = l-^f = 0.077 65 mVMN

For center:
H/B' = 5B/(B/2) = 10 (taking H = 5B as recommended in Chap. 5)
LlB = 1.83/1.22 = 1.5
From these we may write
/, = 0.584 + 1~_2(()Q33) 0.023 = 0.597

using Eq. (5-16) and Table 5-2 (or your program FFACTOR) for factors 0.584 and 0.023.
At DlB = 0.61/1.22 = 0.5, we obtain IF = 0.80 from Fig. 5-7 (or when using FFACTOR for
the Is factors). Substitution into Eq. (9-7) with B' = 1.22/2 = 0.61, and m = 4 yields

K = 0.61(0.07765X4 x 0.597X0.8) = U - 0 5 M N / m 3
You should note that ks does not depend on the contact pressure of the base qo.
For corner:
H/B' = 5B/B = 5(1.22)/1.22 = 5
[from Table 5-2 with L/B = 1.5 obtained for Eq. (5-16)]


04
ls = 0.496 + 7^(0.045) = 0.522 IF = 0.8 (as before)

Again substituting into Eq. (9-7) but with B' = B = 1.22 m and one corner contribution, we have

k> = 1.22 X 0.0776^X0.522 X 0.8 = 2 5 - 2 8 M N / m 3
For an average value we will use weighting, consisting of four center contributions + one corner
value, giving
4(11.5)+ 25.28 ^ O A i r w x T / 3
fe(avg + — ~ = 13.896 MN/m3
We can also estimate ks based on SF = 2 for sand to obtain
ks = 40(SF)(^) = 40(2)(0.200) = 16 MN/m3
For practical usage and since these values of 13.896 and 16.0 are estimates (but reasonably close)
we would use
ks = 15.0 MN/m3 (15000 kN/m3)
Comments. It is evident from this example that the "center" ks is softer (or less stiff) than a corner
(or edge). The center being less stiff is consistent with the dishing of uniformly loaded plates. One
can also zone the area beneath a footing by computing a series of ks values at, say, center, \, | , and
edge points using for the \ and | point the contributions from four rectangles and for the edge the
contributions of two rectangles of the same size.
Note the use of H = 5B = 5 X 1.22 = 6.1 m for both center and corner.

9-7 CLASSICAL SOLUTION OF BEAM
ON ELASTIC FOUNDATION
When flexural rigidity of the footing is taken into account, a solution can be used that is
based on some form of a beam on an elastic foundation. This may be the classical Winkler
solution of about 1867, in which the foundation is considered as a bed of springs ("Winkler
foundation"), or the finite-element procedure of the next section.
The classical solutions, being of closed form, are not so general in application as the finite-
element method. The basic differential equation is (see Fig. 9-10)
E1ji = q = ~Ky (9"n)
where k's = ksB. In solving the equations, a variable is introduced:
A = V 4Ei or AL = V 4^7
Table 9-2 gives the closed-form solution of the basic differential equations for several load-
ings shown in Fig. 9-10 utilizing the Winkler concept. It is convenient to express the trigono-
metric portion of the solutions separately as in the bottom of Table 9-2.
Hetenyi (1946) developed equations for a load at any point along a beam (see Fig. 9-10Z?)
measured from the left end as follows:

The equation for the slope 6 of the beam at any point is not presented since it is of lit-
tle value in the design of a footing. The value of x to use in the equations is from the end of the

as
PA P

>'iA< M-iB' °=PC
where the coefficients A', B', and C are the values for the hyperbolic and trigonometric re-
mainder of Eqs. (9-12) to (9-14).
It has been proposed that one could use AL previously defined to determine if a foundation
should be analyzed on the basis of the conventional rigid procedure or as a beam on an elastic
foundation (see combined footing Example 9-1):

Rigid members: XL < — (bending not influenced much by ks)
Flexible members: AL > TT (bending heavily localized)
The author has found these criteria of limited application because of the influence of the
number of loads and their locations along the member.


The classical solution presented here has several distinct disadvantages over the finite-
element solution presented in the next section, such as

1. Assumes weightless beam (but weight will be a factor when footing tends to separate from
the soil)
2. Difficult to remove soil effect when footing tends to separate from soil
3. Difficult to account for boundary conditions of known rotation or deflection at selected
points
4. Difficult to apply multiple types of loads to a footing
5. Difficult to change footing properties of /, D, and B along member
6. Difficult to allow for change in subgrade reaction along footing

Although the disadvantages are substantial, some engineers prefer the classical beam-on-
elastic-foundation approach over discrete element analyses. Rarely, the classical approach
may be a better model than a discrete element analysis, so it is worthwhile to have access to
this method of solution.

9-8 FINITE-ELEMENT SOLUTION OF BEAM ON
ELASTIC FOUNDATION
The finite-element method (FEM) is the most efficient means for solving a beam-on-elastic-
foundation type of problem based on Eq. (9-10) but requires a digital (or personal) computer.
It is easy to account for boundary conditions (such as a point where there is no rotation or
translation), beam weight, and nonlinear soil effects (either soil-beam separation or a dis-
placement > Xmax).
The FEM is more versatile than the finite-difference method (FDM), because one can
write an equation model for one element and use it for each element in the beam model.
With the finite-difference method all of the elements must be the same length and cross sec-
tion. Different equations are required for end elements than for interior ones, and modeling
boundary conditions is difficult, as is modeling nonlinear soil effects. The FDM had an initial
advantage of not requiring much computer memory, because there is only one unknown at a
node—the displacement. With the discovery of band matrix solution methods this advantage
was completely nullified.
Only the basic elements of the FEM will be given here, and the reader is referred to
Wang (1970) or Bowles (1974a) if more background is required. The computer program B-5
(FADBEMLP) on the enclosed diskette has the necessary routines already coded for the user.
This program was used to obtain text output.

General Equations in Solution
For the following development refer to Fig. 9-11. At any node i (junction of two or more
members at a point) on the structure we may write
Pi = A1-F1-
which states that the external node force P is equated to the contributing internal member
forces F using bridging constants A. It is understood that P and F are used for either forces


or moments and that this equation is shorthand notation for several values of A1-F1- summed
to equal the ith nodal force.
For the full set of nodes on any structure and using matrix notation, where P, F are column
vectors and A is a rectangular matrix, this becomes
P = AF (a)
An equation relating internal-member deformation e at any node to the external nodal
displacements is
e = BX
where both e and X may be rotations (radians) or translations. From the reciprocal theorem
in structural mechanics it can be shown that the B matrix is exactly the transpose of the A
matrix, which is a convenience indeed; thus,
e = ATX (b)
The internal-member forces F are related to the internal-member displacements e and
contributing member stiffnesses S as
F = Se (c)
These three equations are the fundamental equations in the finite-element method of analysis:

Substituting (Z?) into (c),

F = Se - SATX (d)

Substituting (J) into (a),

P = AF = ASA1X (e)

Note the order of terms used in developing Eqs. (d) and (e). Now the only unknowns in this
system of equations are the X's; so the ASAT is inverted to obtain
X = (ASA1T1P (/)

Figure 9-11 External (nodal) and internal (member) finite-element forces.

Nodal P - J f

Element F - e


and with the X's we can back-substitute into Eq. (d) to obtain the internal-member forces that
are necessary for design. This method gives two important pieces of information: (1) design
data and (2) deformation data.
The ASAT matrix above is often called a global matrix, since it represents the system of
equations for each P or X nodal entry. It is convenient to build it from one finite element
of the structure at a time and use superposition to build the global ASAT from the element
EASAT. This is easily accomplished, since every entry in both the global and element ASAT
with a unique set of subscripts is placed into that subscript location in the ASAT, i.e., for
/ = 2, j = 5 all (2, 5) subscripts in EASAT are added into the (2, 5) coordinate location of
the global ASAT.
Developing the Element A Matrix
Consider the single simple beam element shown in Fig. 9-l2b coded with four values of P-X
(note that two of these P-X values will be common to the next member) and the forces on the
element (Fig. 9-12c). The forces on the element include two internal bending moments and
the shear effect of the bending moments. The sign convention used is consistent with your
computer program B-5.
Summing moments on node 1 of Fig. 9-l2d, we obtain
Px = Fi+ OF2
Similarly, summing forces and noting that the soil spring forces are global and will be in-
cluded separately, we have

Placed into conventional form, the element A matrix for element 1 is

The EA matrix for member 2 would contain P^ to P§\ it is not necessary to resubscript the F
values.
Developing the S Matrix
Referring to Fig. 9-13 and using conjugate-beam (moment-area) principles, we see that the
end slopes e\ and e2 are

Developing the Element ESAT and EASAT Matrices
The ESAT matrix4 is formed by multiplying the ES and the transpose of the EA matrix (in
the computer program this is done in place by proper use of subscripting) as shown on the
next page and noting that AT goes with e and X. The EASAT is obtained in a similar manner5
as shown opposite.
The node soil "spring" will have units of FL~l obtained from the modulus of subgrade
reaction and based on contributory node area. When ks = constant, they can be computed as

and

4The element arrays are prefixed with E to differentiate them from global arrays.
5There are several published methods to obtain the element stiffness matrix EASAT (sometimes called K), includ-
ing defining the 16 matrix entries directly. The method given here is easy to understand and program, but more
importantly it produces the ESAT, which can be saved to compute element moments later.

Figure 9-13 Conjugate-beam relation-
ships between end moments and beam
rotations.

The element S matrix then becomes


Bowles (1974a) shows that best results are obtained by doubling the end springs. This was
done to make a best fit of the measured data of Vesic and Johnson (1963) with computations.
This is incorporated into the computer program on the diskette for beams.

There is some logic in end spring doubling (see also comments at end of Example 9-6), in
that if higher edge pressures are obtained for footings, then this translates into "stiffer" end
soil springs. For these matrices use Kx = L2Bk8 and similarly for K5 of Fig. 9-12.
From Fig. 9-12 we can see that summing vertical forces on a node (and using node 1 for
specific illustration) gives
F1 + F2 _
JT2 ~ - AlA2 - 0
Since (Fi + F2)IL is already included in the global ASAT we can rewrite the foregoing as


or the node spring is directly additive to the appropriate diagonal [subscripted with (i, i)]
term. This method is the most efficient way of including the soil springs since they can be
built during element input into a "spring" array. Later the global ASAT is built (and saved
for nonlinear cases) and the springs then added to the appropriate diagonal term (or column
1 of the banded matrix that is usually used).
A check on the correct formation of the EASAT and the global ASAT is that they are
always symmetrical and there cannot be a zero on the diagonal. Note that the soil spring is an
additive term to only the appropriate diagonal term in the global ASAT matrix. This allows
easy removal of a spring for tension effect while still being able to obtain a solution, since
there is still the shear effect at the point (not having a zero on the diagonal). This procedure
has an additional advantage in that the ASAT does not have to be rebuilt for nonlinear soil
effects if a copy is saved to call on subsequent cycles for nodal spring adjustments.

Developing the P Matrix
The P matrix (a column vector for each load case) is constructed by zeroing the array and then
entering those node loads that are nonzero. The usual design problem may involve several
different loading cases (or conditions), so the array is of the form P(j where / identifies the
load entry with respect to the node and P-X coding and j the load case. For example, refer
to Fig. 9-12 where we have column loads at nodes 2 and 4 and two load cases (/ = 2) as
follows:

Load case

Column 1 2

1 (node 2) 140 kips j 200 kips j
1 100 ft-Io 110 ft -k ^
2 (node 4) 200 kips| 300 kipsj

Our nonzero P matrix entries would be (from the P-X coding diagram)

P3J = 100 P Xi = -110 (moment entries)
P4^1 = 140 P 4 2 - 200 (axial loads)
P8! i = 200 P8^2 = 300 (also axial loads)

The loads acting in the same direction as the P-X coding have a (+) sign and opposed a ( - )
sign as for the second load case moment at column 1.
From the foregoing we see that it is necessary to know the P-X coding used in forming
the EA matrix, or output may be in substantial error.
For columns that are intermediate between nodes, we may do one of two things:

1. Simply prorate loads to adjacent nodes using a simple beam model.
2. Prorate loads to adjacent nodes as if the element has fixed ends so the values include
fixed-end moments and shears (vertical forces). This procedure is strictly correct, but the
massive amount of computations is seldom worth the small improvement in computational
precision.


Boundary Conditions
The particular advantage of the finite-element method is in allowing boundary conditions of
known displacements or rotations. When the displacements are zero, the most expeditious
method to account for them is to use P-X coding such that if NP = number of P-X codings
of all the free nodes (thus, NP = 10 in Fig. 9-12) and we want to fix node 5 against both
rotation and translation, we would identify
NP = 8
and use Pg-Xg for both rotation and translation P-X values at node 5 and instruct the computer
that we have NP = 8. The program would then build a 9 X 9 array but only use the active
8 x 8 part. When inspecting the output we would, of course, have to know that node 5 has
been specified to have zero displacements.
When displacements are of a known value (and including 0.0), a different procedure is
required. Here the computer program must be set to allow known displacements. In this case
have the program do the following (the computer program uses ASAT for ASAT):

1. Put a 1 on the diagonal at the point of P-X coding (j, j).
2. Zero all the horizontal A S A ^ entries from k = I ton except k = j .
3. Insert the known displacement S in the P matrix (so P7 = 8).
4. Augment all the other P matrix entries as
P(/) - P(/) - ASA^7 X 5 for i = 1 to NP except i = j
Then set ASAj7- = 0 for i = 1, AT except i = j
When this is done properly, we have an ASAT that has a horizontal and vertical row of zeros
that intersect at (j, j), where there is a 1.0. The P matrix has been augmented everywhere
except at P7, where there is the entry S.
Alternatively, we can use the following (not particularly recommended) approach:
1. Multiply ASA^7 by a very large number N (say N > 1010).
2. Replace P7 by P^ = ASAj7- XNxS.

It is common in foundation design to have displacements that are known to be zero (beam
on rock, beam embedded in an anchor of some type, etc.). Seldom do we have known dis-
placements where S # 0 other than in "what if" studies.
Node Springs
All the author's finite-element programs using beam elements require concentrating the ef-
fect of ks to the nodes as springs. The concentration method usually used is that suggested by
Newmark (1943) for a general parabolic variation of ks versus length. This method is exact
for a parabolic curve and very nearly so for either a linear or cubic curve for ks if the node
spacings are not very large. The error is readily checked because the sum of the node springs
(not considering any doubling or reduction of end springs) should equal the volume under
the ks curve. The equations given by Newmark (1943) include a derivation in the Appendix


to his paper. For constant ks the illustrations for K\, K2 previously given can be used, which
are essentially average end area computations.
We can readily check the programming for the beam equations by referring to Example
9-6, which lists ks and all node springs. The sum of the listed node springs is
i i | ^ + 11616+ 14520+ - + 27588 + ^ ^ = 370550.4
z* z*
The two end values were doubled in the program, since this was a beam. The volume of the
ks curve is
V = BXLXks
and, taking L = sum of element lengths = 6.38 m and B = 2.64 m, we obtain
V = 2.64 X 6.38 X 22000 = 370550
for very nearly an exact check. The reason for this close agreement with using a constant ks
is that the element lengths are rather short.
Spring Coupling
From a Boussinesq analysis it is evident that the base contact pressure contributes to settle-
ments at other points, i.e., causing the center of a flexible uniformly loaded base to settle more
than at the edges. Using a constant ks on a rectangular uniformly loaded base will produce
a constant settlement (every node will have the same AH within computer round-off) if we
compute node springs based on contributing node area. This approach is obviously incorrect,
and many persons do not like to use ks because of this problem. In other words the settlement
is "coupled" but the soil springs from ks have not been coupled.
It is still desirable, however, to use ks (some persons call this a Winkler foundation) in
a spring concept because only the diagonal translation terms are affected. When we have
true coupling, fractions of the springs K[ are in the off-diagonal terms, making it difficult to
perform any kind of nonlinear analysis (soil-base separation or excessive displacements). We
can approximately include coupling effects in several ways:
1. Double the end springs, which effectively increases ks in the end zones. This approach is
not applicable to the sides of very long narrow members.
2. Zone ks with larger values at the ends that transition to a minimum at the center. This
concept was illustrated in Example 9-5 where the center ks was considerably smaller than
the corner value.

For beam-on-elastic-foundation problems, where concentrated loads and moments are
more common than a uniform load, doubling the end springs is probably sufficient coupling.
Finite Element Computer Program for Beam-on-Elastic
Foundation
A computer program would develop the EA and ES for each finite element in turn from input
data describing the member so that /, L, and computations (or read in) for K\ and K2 can
be made. The program performs matrix operations to form the ESAT and EASAT and with
proper instructions identifies the P-X coding so the EASAT entries are correctly inserted into
the global ASAT.


When this has been done for all the finite elements (number of members NM, a global
ASAT of size NP X NP will have been developed as follows:
PNP = ANPXN^S^X^A^XJSJPXNP

and canceling interior terms as shown gives
PNP = A S A N P X N P X N P
which indicates that the system of equations is just sufficient (that is, a square coefficient
matrix, the only type that can be inverted). It also gives a quick estimate of computer needs,
as the matrix is always the size of (NP X NP) where NP is the number of P-X codings.
With proper coding (as in Fig. 9-12) the global ASAT is banded with all zeros except for
a diagonal strip of nonzero entries that is eight values wide. Of these eight nonzero entries,
four are identical (the band is symmetrical). There are matrix reduction routines to solve these
types of half-band width problems. As a consequence the actual matrix required (with a band
reduction method) is only NP X 4 entries instead of NP X NP.
The ASAT is inverted (computer program FADBEMLP on the diskette reduces a band
matrix) and multiplied by the P matrix containing the known externally applied loads. This
step gives the nodal displacements of rotation and translation. The computer program then
rebuilds the EA and ES to obtain the ESAT and, using Eq. (d), computes the element end
moments. Node reactions Rt and soil pressures qt are computed using
Ri = K1X1 q( = ksXt
It may be convenient to store the ESAT on a disk file when the ASAT is being built and recall
it to compute the element end moments of the F matrix.
If the footing tends to separate from the soil or the deflections are larger than Xmax it is
desirable to have some means to include the footing weight, zero the soil springs where nodes
separate, and apply a constant force to nodes where soil deflections exceed Xmax of
Pi = ~Ki(Xmax)
Note the sign is negative to indicate the soil reaction opposes the direction of translation.
Actual sign of the computed P matrix entry is based on the sign convention used in developing
the general case as in Fig. 9-12.
A computer program of this type (FADBEMLP on your diskette) can be used to provide
the output of Example 9-6 and can also be used to solve a number of structural problems by
using 0.0 for ks.
Example 9-6. Given the general footing and load data shown in Fig. E9-6a, assume the loads
are factored and might be obtained from some kind of horizontal tank loading where the loads
are from the tank supports and are the full width (2.64 m) of the footing. Take ks = LF X ks =
1.571 X 14000 = 22000 kN/m3; also /c' = 21 M P a ^ Ec = 21500MPa.

3. The moments for the near end of element 1 and far end of element 12 should both be 0.0 (0.014
and -0.004).
4. If the largest soil pressure of 260.1/LF < qa, the bearing pressure would be O.K. We must use
an LF here since factored loads were input.
5. The largest node displacements are
Translation = 11.8 mm (at node 1)
Rotation = -0.00253 rad (at nodes 1 & 2)
6. The output table of displacements from the disk plot file is used to plot the shear V and moment
M diagrams shown in Fig. E9-6c. You should study these carefully and see how the output is
interpreted—particularly at nodes with input moments. Compare the plots to the output checks
shown in Fig. E9-6d. Refer also to the shear and moment plots of Fig. El3-Ig.

Comments.

1. The author recently noted that Westergaard (1948) indicated that edge springs probably should
be doubled. This suggestion probably did not receive the attention it should have because his
observation was the last page of a "Discussion."
2. The question arises of whether one should double the edge springs or double ks at the ends.
Having checked both procedures, the author recommends doubling the edge springs for a beam-
on-elastic-foundation problem. For mats one probably should double the edge ks as that seems
to give slightly better values over doubling edge springs. Doubling edge ks for mats gives large
computed edge node soil pressures that include both bearing and edge shear and may (incor-
rectly) give qi > qa.
3. There have been some efforts to use only one or two elements by integrating the modulus of
subgrade reaction across the beam length. The author does not recommend this for three reasons:
a. It is difficult to allow for nonlinear effects or for soil-footing separation.
b. When using a nonlinear analysis with Xmax the setting of a soil spring to zero introduces a
discontinuity into the model. The discontinuity is minimized by using a number of closely
spaced elements, the better to transition from the displacements X > Xmax and displacements
X ^= Xmax.
c. It is difficult to produce a shear and moment diagram unless several elements are used. With
the availability of computers, there is no justification to use a clever one-element model and
have an enormous amount of hand computations to obtain the shear and moment diagrams.
The author suggests that one should use a minimum of 10 elements for a beam—more for long
beams or if it appears that any nonlinear zones are present.

9 9 RING FOUNDATIONS
Ring foundations can be used for water tower structures, transmission towers, TV antennas,
and to support various process tower superstructures. The ring foundation considered here
is a relatively narrow circular beam as opposed to the circular mat considered in the next
chapter.
The finite-element method (FEM) for a ring foundation is somewhat similar to the beam-
on-elastic-foundation method. The node and element numbering are rather straightforward,
as shown in Fig. 9-14. The computer program is considerably more lengthy since the P-X
coding is somewhat different (see Fig. 9-15) in order to obtain a bandwidth of 9. A bandwidth
of 60 is obtained if one proceeds in a continuous manner counterclockwise around the ring
from node 1. The element A matrix is:

Check node 2:

Figure 9-14 Ring foundation configuration and definitions. Note that loads should be placed on mean radius
Rm, which divides ring area in half, and not on average radius, which divides the ring width in half. Always orient
your ring so node 1 is at top of page as shown here.

and, allowing for torsion, the element stiffness matrix is

The usual matrix multiplications are carried out to produce the element EASAT, which is
then summed into the global ASAT matrix, which is then banded and reduced to produce
the nodal displacements X1-. The displacements are then used to compute the element forces
(moments and shears), soil reactions, and pressures.
To avoid twisting and for a theoretical uniform displacement across the radial line defining
any node, one should place the loads on the mean radius Rm, defining the center of area and
computed as
_ /lD2 + OD2
* m " V 8 '
rather than on the arithmetic average radius,
_ (ID + OD)
Ra = ^ •
The moments are computed at the center of area defined by the mean radius Rm (see Fig.
9-l4a) so that the displacements can be assumed to be constant across the ring radius at the
node. Since the inner and outer element lengths are different but with the same end displace-
ments, there should be a different moment according to the central finite-difference expres-
sion given as
EI

Replacing Ax2 by A//2 we can readily see the moment at the inner radius defined by the ID
is larger than at the mean radius, and the outer moment at the radius defined by the OD is
smaller than the mean radius value. We can adjust for these values as follows:

where Mm = computed value on computer output sheets, and the interior moment Mt and
exterior moment M0 can be computed using the preceding expressions.


The finite-element length H is taken as the chord distance and differs slightly from the arc
length La as follows:
La = Rm X 0.314 16 H = 2 X/?m sin 9° = Rm X 0.312 87
The node springs (see Fig. 9-l4b) are computed using a constant value of modulus of
subgrade reaction ks as
0.7854(OD2 - ID2)fc5
Ki 20
However, one may input springs for selected nodes in the computer program.
The solution of a ring foundation will be illustrated by Example 9-7, using program B-17,
described in the README.DOC file on your diskette.

Example 9-7. Find the bending moments and other data for a ring foundation given the following:
ID = 14.5 m OD = 16.0 m Dc = 0.76 m
Ec = 22400 MPa ks = 13 600 + OZ1 kN/m3
(Assume Poisson's ratio of concrete /JL = 0.15)
Three equally spaced (120°) loads of 675 kN each
Tangential moment = +200 kPa at node 1 (+) using the right-hand rule (based on the P-X
coding of Fig. 9-15)
Consider the ring foundation to be weightless (although the computer program allows the input
of the unit weight of the beam material and will then compute a weight contribution for each node).

Solution.
Step 1. We will put one load on node 1 and the other two will fall on element 7 and on element
14 (as shown on Fig. E9-7#). The loads on elements 7 and 14 will have to be prorated to adjacent
nodes. We can use either La or H for the prorating. Using La, we write
_ /14.52 + 162
R " = \ Q = 7 ' 6 3 4 m
[Average Ra = (14.5 + 16)/4 = 7.625 m < 7.634]

La = 7.634(0.31416) = 2.398 m
Load location = 120° - 6 X 18° = 120° - 108° = 12° into element 7, which is exactly two-thirds
of the length (either La or H), that is,
L-L
a = |(2.398) = 1.599 m ^ = ±^- = 0.799 m
The column loads are entered in the vertical P's so that

Node 1: Moment gives Pi = 200 kN • m


Figure E9-7a

These data are shown on Fig. E9-lb (computer output pages) where the P matrix is listed.
Step 2. Check the output. The output is partially self-checking. Note that the program converts Es
from MPa to kPa and computes the shear modulus
G- = 2 a T 7 i r 9 7 3 9 1 3 0 k P a
1. First check that the sum of input vertical forces = sum of soil springs (the program sums the
spring forces).
2. Since the loads are symmetrical and there is a moment only at node 1, there should be some
symmetry in the soil springs (which also represents symmetry in the translation displacements).
3. All of the soil springs should be equal (unless some were input (not done here)). The springs
should be
Kt = 0-7854(16* -R5»X13 600) _ u m * m / m

(The computer value of 24433.72 uses more digits, but in single precision.)
4. The program computes the moment of inertia using a beam with b = (16 - 14.5)/2 = 0.75 m
as
/ , - bJl - 0 ^ 2 7 6 3 ) - 0.Q27436 m<
The torsion inertia J for a rectangle is computed in the program as:

t = thickness, b = width of rectangle, and t < b.

5. The nonlinear routines are not activated since XmSLX (XMAX) was set at 0.02 m (20 mm) and the
largest displacement, at node 1 (as expected with a full 675 kN located at the point), is 0.007 93
m (7.93 mm).
6. With a symmetrical load and no radial moments the radial rotation at nodes 1 and 11 are both
0.00000 as expected.
7. Note that even though the node coding is somewhat mixed, the node and element order is re-
covered for the output. This result makes it easy to check input node springs. Both input node
springs and displacements greater than XMAX are identified on the output sheets.

8. One should never accept FEM output as correct without at least some internal checks. Here Fig.
E9-7c (next page) illustrates checking nodes 1 and 11 for statics (X M = 0 and X Fv = 0). To
orient the moments and end shears, you should be inside the ring and look outward at the element
or node of interest. Element end shears are computed (but watch the signs—both the moments
and shear direction have one) as (Fi + Fi)IB.. For any element the shear at each end is the same
but reversed in direction (refer also to Figs. 9-11, 9-12, and 9-15Z?). For element 1 we have the
numerical value of the shear using H = 2(7.634) sin 9° = 2.388 m as
V = ~ 6 1 9 ' 8 ^ o t 4 5 ' 2 1 4 = -240.6 kN (-240.595 computer)
Although the foregoing came out (-), you must look at the element to assign the correct direction
(up or down).
Comment For design one might use the computed displacements from an analysis such as this,
depending on how much confidence the user has in the value of ks. Many designers use some alter-
native method for computing settlements that often includes both "immediate" and "consolidation"
settlement components. A method for "immediate" settlements was illustrated in Example 5-13
using a case history.

9-10 GENERAL COMMENTS ON THE
FINITE-ELEMENT PROCEDURE
Strictly, the finite-element model used in this chapter should be termed a beam-element
model. It is a beam-column model when axial forces are included as a part of the element force
model. The finite-element method is practical only when written into a computer program,
because there are usually too many equations for hand solving. The following comments are

observations made from solving a large number of different problems using the finite-element
method.

1. One must always check finite-element program output. A finite-element computer pro-
gram should be somewhat self-checking. This is accomplished by echoing back the input
and comparing sums of input versus output forces.
a. Carefully check the input data for correct dimensions, elastic properties, and units.
b. Check the X M = 0 at nodes and the sum of soil reactions equal to applied loads
(X Fv — 0). Note how applied moments were treated in Examples 9-6 and 9-7. Also
in these examples observe that select nodes were given statics checks.
c. When the program seems to have been working and a new problem gives obviously
incorrect output, compare the P-X coding to be sure you are inputting the loads with
the correct signs.
2. One should use at a minimum 8 to 10 finite elements, but it is not usually necessary to
use more than 20. The number of finite elements used (NM) depends on the length of
the member. Also more elements (and closely spaced) are needed if you consider soil
nonlinearity or have shear and moment diagrams to plot.
3. One should not use a very short element next to a long element. Use more finite elements
and effect a transition between short and long members. Try to keep the ratio

- ^ - < 2 and not more than 3.
^short
4. The value of ks directly affects the deflection but has very little effect on the computed
bending moments—at least for reasonable values of ks such as one might obtain from
using ks = 40(SF)<^ (or ks = 12(SF)^). If one must obtain accurate displacements one
must input a good estimation of ks.
There are a large number of published solutions claimed by their authors to be better than
the simple one proposed here for the beam-on-elastic foundation. A recent claim [Chiwanga
and Valsangkar (1988)] has a reference list that may be of some value. Generally, these solu-
tions require additional soil data (which are usually estimated) or obscure soil parameters that
are not clearly defined. As a consequence, the solution that is the simplest and requires the
minimum of soil properties is going to be the best one—regardless of claims to the contrary.
After all, if one must guess at soil values, keep it simple.
As previously stated, a number of beam-on-elastic-foundation solutions claim to allow the
user to model the foundation with one or two elements. This is too few for practical purposes
in general and too few for realism when including nonlinear effects or where critical values
of shear or moment are required for plotting shear and moment curves. In using one or two
elements in the beam model these authors do some form of integration, so the result is often a
difficult equation containing hyperbolic (and sometimes Bessel and/or Hankel) functions and
with strange symbols. These models seldom have any provision for soil-footing separation or
for modeling the case where the displacements X > Xmax.
A note of caution—since ks is usually estimated—is that the use of refined methods may
give undeserved confidence in the computed results.
The only ring solutions known to the author are a closed-form procedure given by Voltera
(1952) and Voltera and Chung (1955) and the finite-element method given in the preceding
section.

MAT FOUNDATIONS

10-1 INTRODUCTION
A mat foundation is a large concrete slab used to interface one column, or more than one col-
umn in several lines, with the base soil. It may encompass the entire foundation area or only
a portion. A mat may be used to support on-grade storage tanks or several pieces of indus-
trial equipment. Mats are commonly used beneath silo clusters, chimneys, and various tower
structures. It becomes a matter of definition as to when the dimensions of a spread footing
make the transition into being called a mat. Figure 10-1 illustrates several mat configurations
as might be used for buildings. Those shown encompass the entire building plan, but this is
not a requirement.
A mat foundation may be used where the base soil has a low bearing capacity and/or the
column loads are so large that more than 50 percent of the area is covered by conventional
spread footings. It is common to use mat foundations for deep basements both to spread the
column loads to a more uniform pressure distribution and to provide the floor slab for the
basement. A particular advantage for basements at or below the GWT is to provide a water
barrier. Depending on local costs, and noting that a mat foundation requires both positive and
negative reinforcing steel, one may find it more economical to use spread footings—even if
the entire area is covered. Spread footings avoid the use of negative reinforcing steel and can
be accomplished as in Fig. 10-2 by pouring alternate footings, to avoid formwork, and using
fiber spacer boards to separate the footings poured later.
Mat foundations may be supported by piles in situations such as high groundwater (to
control buoyancy) or where the base soil is susceptible to large settlements. We should note
that the mat contact stresses will penetrate the ground to a greater depth or have greater
relative intensity at a shallower depth (refer to Figs. 5-4 and 5-9). Both factors tend to increase
settlements unless there is a stress compensation from excavated soil so that the net increase
in pressure is controlled.

10-2 TYPES OF MAT FOUNDATIONS
Figure 10-1 illustrates several possible mat-foundation configurations. Probably the most
common mat design consists of a flat concrete slab 0.75 to 2 m thick and with continuous
two-way reinforcing top and bottom. This type of foundation tends to be heavily overde-
signed for three major reasons:

1. Additional cost of analysis methods, which are, however, not exact.
2. The extra cost of a reasonable overdesign of this element of the structure will generally
be quite small relative to total project cost.
3. The extra margin of safety provided for the modest additional cost.


Figure 10-3 Increase in bearing capacity by using a mat foundation.

10-3 BEARING CAPACITY OF MAT FOUNDATIONS
The mat foundation must be designed to limit settlements to a tolerable amount. These set-
tlements may include the following:

1. Consolidation—including any secondary effects
2. Immediate or elastic
3. A combination of consolidation and immediate amounts

A mat must be stable against a deep shear failure, which may result in either a rotational
failure (see Fig. 4-la), typified by the Transcona elevator failure (White, 1953), or a vertical
(or punching) failure. A uniform vertical punching failure would not be particularly serious,
as the effect would simply be a large settlement that could probably be landscaped; however,
as the settlement is not likely to be uniform or predicted as such, this mode should be treated
with concern equal to that for the deep-seated shear failure.
The bearing-capacity equations of Table 4-1 may be used to compute the soil capacity,
e.g.,

<7uit = cNcscicdc + yDNqsqiqdq + -XBNySyiydy

or

tfuit - 5.14ywQ +s'c+d'c- O + q
Use B = least mat dimension and D = depth of mat (Fig. 10-3). The allowable soil pressure
is obtained by applying a suitable factor of safety (see Table 4-9) and any applicable reduction
for mat width B as suggested in Sec. 4-4.
When the bearing capacity is based on penetration tests (e.g., SPT, CPT) in sands and
sandy gravel one may use Eq. (4-13) rewritten [see Meyerhof (1965)] as follows:

where Kd = 1 + 033D/B < 1.33
AHa = allowable settlement such as 25, 40, 50, 60 mm, etc.
The factor 0.08 converts Meyerhof's original equation to allow a 50 percent increase in bear-
ing capacity and to produce kPa. The bracket ratio of (AHa/25.0) allows the reader to use
any specified settlement, since the original equation was based on a settlement of 25 mm (1
inch). For a mat the ratio ((B + F>$)/B)2 — 1.0 and is neglected.

Spread footings Mat


With qc (in kPa) from a CPT we can use Fig. 3-23 or Eq. (4-20) to estimate an N$$ value
for use in Eq. (10-1). A typical computation for A/55, which you can use as a guide, is given
in Fig. 3-23. For CPT in cohesive soil one can use Eq. (3-11) to obtain the undrained shear
strength (0 = 0° case) su and use the bearing capacity equations (Meyerhof, Hansen, or
Vesic) from Table 4-1 simplified to
quh = 5.14sM(l + s'c + d'c - ic) + yD
Alternatively, use Eqs. (4-19) directly with qc. In most cases the mat will be placed on
cohesive soil, where qu (or qc) from standard penetration tests is the principal strength data
available. In these cases SPT sampling is usually supplemented with several pushed thin-
walled tube samples so that laboratory unconfined (or confined triaxial) compression tests
can be performed to obtain what are generally considered more reliable strength parameters.
Any triaxial laboratory tests may be CK0XX, as indicated in Sec. 2-11, and either (or both)
compression (case 1) and extension (case 3) type of Fig. 2-40. Alternatively, in situ tests may
be performed, such as the pressuremeter or borehole shear, to obtain the design strength data.

10-4 MAT SETTLEMENTS
Mat foundations are commonly used where settlements may be a problem, for example, where
a site contains erratic deposits or lenses of compressible materials, suspended boulders, etc.
The settlement tends to be controlled via the following:

1. Use of a larger foundation to produce lower soil contact pressures.
2. Displaced volume of soil (flotation effect); theoretically if the weight of excavation equals
the combined weight of the structure and mat, the system "floats" in the soil mass and no
settlement occurs.
3. Bridging effects attributable to
a. Mat rigidity.
b. Contribution of superstructure rigidity to the mat.
4. Allowing somewhat larger settlements, say, 50 instead of 25 mm.

The flotation effect should enable most mat settlements, even where consolidation is a
problem or piles are used, to be limited to 50 to 80 mm. A problem of more considerable
concern is differential settlement. Again the mat tends to reduce this value. We can see in
Fig. 10-4 that bending moments (6£/A/L2) and shear forces (12£7A/L3) induced in the su-
perstructure depend on relative movement A between beam ends. Mat continuity results in
a somewhat lower assumed amount of differential settlement relative to the total expected
settlement versus a spread footing as follows:

Expected maximum Expected differential
Foundation type settlement, mm settlement, mm

Spread 25 20
Mat 50 20

Computer methods that incorporate frame-foundation interaction can allow one to estimate
both total and differential settlements. The total settlements will be only as good as the soil

data, however, and if other than a strip from the mat is used as a beam-on-elastic foundation
type of analysis, the computational effort is substantial.
The differential settlement may be arbitrarily taken as 20 mm (0.75 in.) if the total expected
settlement A// is not more than 50 mm or may be approximated using a rigidity factor Kr
[see ACI Committee 336 (1988)] defined as
FTi.
*- = E& (10"2)
EIb may be taken as
Elb = EIf + X EIbl + X ^ (10-3)
where EIt, = flexural rigidity of the superstructure and mat
E = composite modulus of elasticity of superstructure frame
EIf = footing or mat flexural rigidity
E5 = modulus of elasticity of soil

^ T = effective rigidity of shear walls perpendicular to B; h = height; a =
wall thickness
X EIhi = rigidity of the several members making up the frame resistance per-
pendicular to B
B = base width of foundation perpendicular to direction of interest

ACI Committee 336 suggests that mat differential settlements are related to both the total
estimated foundation settlement AH and the structure rigidity factor Kr about as follows:

Total
settlement


For Kr Differential settlement expected

0 0.5 X AH for long base
0.35 X AH for square base
0.5 0.1 x AH
> 0.5 Rigid mat; no differential settlement

Analyses of settlements will have to be performed where the net increase in pressure ex-
ceeds the existing in situ pressure p'o. These may be immediate and/or consolidation settle-
ments adjusted for OCR and depending on the underlying soil stratification.
A major problem—particularly for deep excavations in clay—is expansion and/or lateral
flow into the excavation base so that the base elevation rises. This phenomenon is termed
heave, and values of 25 to 50 mm are very common. Values up to 200 mm (about 8 in.)
are reported in the literature. It is difficult to compute settlements when heave has occurred.
Theoretically, all the heave should be recovered if we reapply a mat pressure q0 equal to
that previously existing. In practice this recovery does not occur, or at least it does not occur
with the same rapidity as the heave. It should be expected that if part of the heave occurs
from a deep-seated lateral flow (refer to Fig. 4-1 elements 1 and 2) it will be very difficult
to predict either the total amount of heave or how much of this will be recovered by elastic
recompression. In general, where heave is involved, considerable experience and engineering
judgment are necessary in estimating probable soil response, for there are currently no reliable
theories for the problem. There is some claim that a finite element of the elastic continuum
computation can resolve the dilemma; however, this is a speculative procedure aided by hope
of a happy outcome of computations and measurements. The reason is that a finite-element
computation is only as good as the input parameters of E5 and /JL . Even were we to be able to
obtain a reliable initial Es it will reduce during, and after excavation, as the loss of confining
pressure p'o and expansion produces heave.
Heave can also occur in deep excavations in sand but the amount is usually very small.
Heave is usually not a consideration where the excavations are on the order of 2 to 3 m in
depth in most soils, but it becomes a major problem for excavations of 10 to 20 m in clay.

Example 10-1. For the soil profile of Fig. E10-1 (a composite of the several site borings to save
text space) estimate the allowable bearing capacity for a mat foundation to be located at D =
1.5 m.

Solution. We will estimate an allowable bearing capacity based on qu and adjust it so the settlement
is approximately adequate.
These data are basically the type a geotechnical consultant would have on which to make an
allowable pressure recommendation.

Step 1. Find a qa based on strength alone with SF = 3 for clay. As in Example 4-4,

qa- s p - 1.3(5./) 2 3

= 1.3(5.14)^? = 334.IkPa

Tentatively, qa = 300 kPa = qu (see Ex 4-4)
Step 2. Find qa so mat settlement is on the order of about 50 mm.


a. Find the average Es.
The depth H from base of mat to rock is
H = (4.90 - 1.5) + 3.3 + 7 + 13.8 = 27.5 m
The average Es in this depth (and using Table 5-5) is
EsX = 1 0 ( y ^ = 15000OkPa (average range of stiff clay and su = ^ )
Es2 = 500(N55 + 15) (the most conservative equation in Table 5-5)
Es2 = 500 18 (— J + 15 = 18 950 kPa (converting N70 to TV55 and rounding)

Es3 = 500122 (^ j + 151 = 22 000 kPa (for 7 m stratum)

Es4 = 500 j 4 0 ( ^ U 15] = 3290OkPa
The weighted average Es is

_ 3.4(150000) + 3.3(18950) + 7.0(22000) + 13.8(32900)
^s(av) — 27~5
= 1180555 = 4 2 9 3 Q k p a

b. Estimate the mat will be on the order of 14 m, giving

Estimate /UL = 0.3 for all the layers.

For a settlement Ai/ = 50 mm (0.050 m) we solve for the required qa{ = qo) to obtain

This qa should limit the mat settlement to about 50 mm, which is a common allowable value for
mat foundations.

Note: A qualifying statement should be included with this recommendation that if, as the design
proceeds and B is found to be substantially different from 14 m, it may be necessary to revise qa.
Recommend qa = 250 kPa.

10-5 MODULUS OF SUBGRADE REACTION ks
FOR MATS AND PLATES
All three discrete element methods given in this chapter for mats/plates use the modulus of
subgrade reaction ks to support the plate. The modulus ks is used to compute node springs
based on the contributing plan area of an element to any node as in Fig. 10-5. From the figure
we see the following:

Node Contributing area

1 (corner) \ of rectangle abde
2 (side) \ of abde + \ of beef
3 (interior) \ of each rectangle framing
to a common node (as node 3)

For a triangle one should arbitrarily use one-third of the triangle area to any corner node.
For these area contributions the fraction of ks node resistance from any element is
Kt = ks, kN/m3, X Area, m2 = units of kN/m (or kips/ft in Fps)
Since this computation gives units of a "spring" it is common to call the effect a node spring.
In this form the springs are independent of each other, the system of springs supporting the
plate is termed a "Winkler" foundation, and the springs are uncoupled. Uncoupling means
that the deflection of any spring is not influenced by adjacent springs.


Figure 10-5 Method of prorating ks to build node springs for rectangles and triangles.

Because the springs are uncoupled, some designers do not like to use the concept of ks,
preferring instead to use a FEM of the elastic continuum with Es and /x as elastic parameters.
This choice does somewhat couple the effects; however, the computations are extensive and
only as good as one's estimate ofEs and /JL. It has already been shown in Sec. 9-6 that there is
a direct relationship between these parameters and ks. In any case the use of ks in analyzing
mats is rather widespread because of the greater convenience of this parameter. There is
actually little computational evidence that the FEM of the elastic continuum provides better
solutions than using a "Winkler" foundation.
The author [Bowles (1986)], and as given in previous editions of this textbook, has ap-
proximately coupled the springs. In general, coupling can be done as follows:

1. Simply double the edge springs of a mat (we doubled the end springs of the beam-on-
elastic foundation in Chap. 9). This should only be done under these conditions:
a. The plate or mat is uniformly loaded except for edge moments as one would obtain
from a tank base.
b. The plate or mat has only one or at most two column loads.
c. The computed node soil pressures q are in the range of mat load 2 P/Am, where Am =
area of the mat. If there are large differences do not double the edge springs. How does


one ascertain this? Use computer program B-6 (FADMAT on your diskette), double the
edge springs, and inspect the output. If the contact pressures q are questionable, copy
the data file, edit the copy to remove the edge spring doubling controls, and rerun. Use
the most reasonable output.
2, We can zone the mat area using softer springs in the innermost zone and transitioning
to the outer edge. Zoning is computed as in Example 10-2 and usually the three zones
computed there are sufficient. Refer to Example 10-6 and data file EXAM106B.DTA for
the method.
The simplest zoning (which effectively doubles the edge springs) is to use two zones—
an interior one, which includes all of the nodes except the edge ones, and all the perimeter
nodes for the second "zone." Use 1.5 to 2 X ^interior for these edge (or perimeter) nodes.
But be aware this will result in large computed edge pressures. Element data generator
program B-18 (on your README.DOC file) is particularly well-suited to do these com-
putations.
3. You should not both double the edge springs and zone the mat area for the same program
execution. Use either one or the other, or simply use a constant ks beneath the entire foun-
dation. This latter may be the most nearly correct when there are a number of column
loads. There has been some attempt at coupling by using the Boussinesq equation [Eq.
(5-3) or (5-4)] in this fashion:
a. Make a trial run and obtain the node pressures.
b. Use these node pressures and compute the pressure increase profiles at adjacent nodes.
c. Use these pressure increase profiles to modify the ks around these several nodes. This
approach requires a very massive amount of computing and is not recommended by the
author. It does not make much sense to use an approximation to refine an "estimate."

Example 10-2. For the soil data of Example 10-1 recommend ks for the 14 X 14 m mat foundation.

Solution. For many cases a single value of ks is recommended that may be an average for the base.
We will do this but also give the three zone values since very little additional effort is required.

Figure E10-2


Step 1. The center ks (point C of Fig. E10-2) is readily computed from the same data used to obtain
qa in Example 10-1. From Example 10-1 obtain
1 _ Aff - 0 0 0 0 2 4 - * £ - * - l
ks ~ A^ " a u u u 2 4 " > AH ~ ks~ O00024
and center ks = 4166.7 -* 4200 kN/m3.
Step 2. The edge (points of Fig. E10-2) value is obtained by dividing the 14 m mat into two parts
of BXL = 1 X 14 with a common corner H/B' = 4 (as before) but L/B = 2, D/B = 0.1, /x = 0.3,
so

I5 = 0.476 + ^(0.069) = 0.515 IF = 0.95 (using FFACTOR)
EF> - X~^ - ° 9 1 - 9 19x10-5

'~ 42930 " 4 2 9 3 0 ~ 2 A 2 x l °
Rearranging Eq. (5-16«) into Eq. (9-7), we have

*" = IFEku} - 7(2.12 X 1 0 - 4 X 0.515X0.95) = 6887-> 6900 kN/rn^
t
(We used m = 2 since there are two common corners.)
Step 3. For the | point (point B) we have midpoints of two sets of rectangles:
Set 1: B' = 1 L' = 10.5m L/B = 1.5 IF = 0.95 H/B' = 4
/, = 0.483 (program FFACTOR direct)
Set 2: B' = 3.5 L = 7.0 m L/B = 2 H/B = 27.5/3.5 = 7.86
/5 = 0.630

^(1/4) = 7(2.12 X 10-5)(2 x 0.483)(0.95) + 35(2.12 X 10-5)(2 X 0.63O)(0.95)
t t
for 2 rectangles

= 2 . 2 5 0 x 1 0 - 4 = 4 ^ 4 9 - 4 5 0 0 k N / m 3
The value of &5(i/4) is not the sum of set 1 and set 2 but is actually the reciprocal of the sum of the
displacements as given by placing the sum under a single common numerator of 1 as here.
Step 4. If a single value of ks is to be provided, one might use either
4200 + 4500 + 6900 - o n A 1 X T / 3
ks = = 5200 kN/m
or (weighting the center ks)
. 4(4200)+ 6900 . _ . . ^A A 1 1 V T / 3
ks = — = 4740 -* 4700 kN/m
Comments. This set of computations for ks is theoretically exact since the displacements are theo-
retical and the definition of ks has been strictly followed. The only approximations are in whether
Es and /JL are correct.


MODULUS OF SUBGRADE REACTION AND CONSOLIDATION SETTLEMENTS. It is
not uncommon that a mat is placed on a soil that is analyzed by using ks, but there are, in
addition, consolidation settlements that will occur later.
It is a relatively simple exercise in using the definition of ks to include the effect of con-
solidation settlements. This can be done as follows:
*• - Is <">
Although the base contact pressure qo remains constant the total settlement is
Mi' = A// + AHC
giving

< - AflTA* <*>
Dividing Eq. (b) by Eq. (a), we obtain
_ ksAH
s ~ AH + AH
C

 (C)

We can see that including the consolidation settlement reduces ks to the lesser k's value of
Eq. (c).

Example 10-3. What is the recommended k's (constant value) if the consolidation settlement is
estimated to be 50 mm in Example 10-2? Use ks = 5200 kN/m3.

Solution, From Example 10-1 a contact pressure of q0 = 205 kPa produces A// = 50 mm =
0.050 m. From Example 10-2 we see the elastic ks was independent of qa\ thus, using Eq. (c) we
write
5200(50) ^ ™ 1 X T / 3
^ = l o T W = 2 6 O O k N / m
Comments. It is presumed that the consolidation pressure is based on qo = qa = 200 kPa. One
would probably have to inspect the computer output to find out if the contact pressure in the zone
of interest was much different from 200 kPa. If so, a new value of A//c would have to be computed
and the problem recycled.

10-6 DESIGN OF MAT FOUNDATIONS
There are several methods to design a mat (or plate) foundation.

1. An approximate method. The mat is divided into strips loaded by a line of columns and re-
sisted by soil pressure. This strip is then analyzed as a combined footing. This method can
be used where the mat is very rigid and the column pattern is fairly uniform in both spacing
and loads. This method is not recommended at present because of the substantial amount
of approximations and the wide availability of computer programs that are relatively easy
to use—the finite grid method (program B 6 on your program diskette) in particular. A mat


is generally too expensive and important not to use the most refined analytical methods
available.
2. Approximate flexible method. This method was suggested by ACI Committee 336 (1988)
and is briefly described here, and the essential design aids are provided. If this method is
used it should be programmed as for the AIRPAVE computer program noted in subsection
10-6.2 following.
3. Discrete element methods. In these the mat is divided into elements by gridding. These
methods include the following:
a. Finite-difference method (FDM)
b. Finite-element method (FEM)
c. Finite-grid method (FGM)

10-6.1 Approximate Flexible Method
The approximate flexible method of ACI Committee 336 requires the following steps:

2. Compute the plate rigidity D (unfortunately, same symbol as footing depth).
3. Compute the radius of effective stiffness L (Note: the approximate zone of any column
influence is ~ 4L).
4. Compute the radial and tangential moments, the shear, and deflection using the following
equations (the Z1 factors, from Hetenyi (1946), are not easy to compute) where load P acts:
Mr = -^[z"-l-zrLz^\ (1(M)
Mt = - j \jxcZA + ]~Y^^ (10-5)

AH = —— (vertical displacement) (10-6)
oD

A// = ——ZT, (at distance r from load) (10-6«)

V = -^jA (shear) (10-7)

where P — column load, kN or kips
D = plate stiffness, as

D = TTZTT^ ^r (units of moment)

V ks
Mn Mt = radial and tangential moments at the load point of Fig. 10-6, per unit of
width in units of P, L
V = shear per unit of width of mat or plate in units of P

The radial (Mr) and tangential (Mt) moments in polar coordinates at the load point are
converted to rectangular coordinates Mx, My, referenced to the origin, using the transfer
equations shown in Fig. 10-6. For the several loads in the influence region L these Mx, My
moment values are summed with attention to sign for design of the plate.

Load point


When the edge of the mat is within the radius of influence L, calculate the edge moment
and shear. The parallel edge moment and shear are then applied as edge loads with opposite
sign. When several columns overlap in the zone L, apply superposition to obtain the net effect.
An illustration of computations for a mat are given by Shukla (1984) using this procedure.
The D calculated in this reference is in error, so that the resulting computations are not quite
correct; but the general procedure gives an illustration of the method.
10-6.2 Mats or Slabs for Industrial Warehouses
and Concrete Airstrips
Industrial floor slabs and concrete airport pavements are somewhat similar and can be de-
signed using the procedure outlined here. One additional step is required. From Westergaard
(1948) we can obtain an equation for the bending stresses in the bottom of a slab under a
wheel load. This equation is

{l;} - & <•+"<>'"-f^> *2(1 - * • > £ ! <>°-8>
Here terms not defined previously are t = plate thickness; a,b = axis dimensions of an
ellipsoid used to model the tire footprint. Approximately [given by PCA (1955)] we have
Area = tire load/tire pressure
/ A r e a n • x
a = V^6655) (1°ngaX1S)
b = 0.6655 X a (short axis)
Use consistent units for t, a, b of meters or inches. If tire load is in kN use tire pressure in kPa;
if load is in pounds use tire pressure in psi. As you can see, there is a sign convention involved
with the several equations given here. To understand the significance of the signs you should
solve a simple slab where you know there is tension (or compression) in the bottom and
compare the result to the signs for stress or moment values given by the equations. Convert
the moments of Eqs. (10-4) and (10-5) to stresses by using the conventional

fc = —j- = —Y (since M/ = per unit of width)

In usage one would program Eq. (10-8) together with the Z,- factors and Eqs. (10-4) through
Eq. (10-7). If the point where the stresses are wanted is under a wheel, include Eq. (10-8) in
the analysis. If the point is not under a wheel, use only the equations containing the Z,- factors.
You need to program the Z1- factors so that interpolation is not necessary (it is also difficult to
obtain reliable values from Fig. 10-6). Figure 10-7 illustrates a set of wheels (these are one
landing gear of an airplane) but could be from a wheeled loader in a warehouse. In using this
procedure it may be worthwhile to provide suitable load transfer dowels into perimeter wall
footings for jointed slabs. For airport runways the common procedure is to use continuously
reinforced concrete (CRC) so joints are not used. The pavement edges are usually thickened
such that edge formulas do not have to be considered. Floor slab edges in warehouses probably
should be thickened as well, partly because of the difficulty in obtaining good compaction
adjacent to the perimeter wall footings.

tations for tire load and the approximate ellipse dimensions for use in Eq. (10-8).

10-7 FINITE-DIFFERENCE METHOD FOR MATS
The finite-difference method uses the fourth-order differential equation found in any text on
the theory of plates and shells [Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger (1959)]:
dAw 2dAw dAw _ q P
J7 + dx1 dy2 + Jy* " D + D(dx dy) ( }
which can be transposed into a finite-difference equation when r = 1 (Fig. 10-8):
20wo — 8(W^ + WB + WR + Wi) + 2(WTL + WTR + WBL + WBR)
qh4 Ph2
+ (WJT + WBB + WLL + WRR) = -jy + -jy (10-10)

When r ^ l , this becomes (as in program B-19, but with much algebra and many steps not
shown)
( ^ + ^ + 6)W0 + ( ~ 7 - ^)(WL + ^ ) + (~~ ~ A^(WT + WB)
2 1

Since ^ = - ^ w 0 we must rearrange the wo term of Eq. (10-11) to read

(a)

Slab

Area


The form shown for the ks term results from computing a spring using ksrh2, dividing through
by rh2, and multiplying by h4. Note that rD does not cancel in the P term.
When r = 1 we have the familiar deflection coefficient at any interior node of

(20 +ks-\wo (b)

Referring to Fig. 10-8, we see that the horizontal grid spacing rh can be different from the
vertical grid spacing h(\ < r or r < 1). In a computer program, of course, one simply orients
the mat so that the minimum grid points are horizontal with the origin of the grid at the lower
left corner. The input then consists in the horizontal grid spacing and vertical grid spacing,
which are constant, and the band width, which is 2 X horizontal grid points + 1 (thus, a
minimum is obtained if the horizontal grid points are the minimum).
The finite-difference method has several advantages:

1. It has been widely used (and should be used as a check on alternative methods where it is
practical).
2. It is reliable if the mat can be modeled using a finite-difference grid.
3. It is rapid since the input data are minimal compared with any other discrete method, and
the computations to build the stiffness array are not so extensive as other methods. Usually
only three to five lines of input data are needed compared with up to several hundred for
the other methods.

There are also a number of disadvantages:

1. It is extremely difficult to model boundary conditions of column fixity.
2. It is very difficult to model notches, holes, or reentrant corners.
3. It is difficult to apply a concentrated moment (as from a column) since the difference
model uses moment/unit of width.

The following example illustrates typical input and output from an FDM program (e.g.,
program FADMATFD, B-19).

Example 10-4. Do the Example 10-5 (p. 565) using thefinite-differencemethod (FDM) to illustrate
the small amount of input needed and typical output, at least output using program FADMATFD.

Select data marked with a u* from the computer output sheet (Fig. E10-4) is shown on Fig.

Note that the program FADMATFD allows a "nonlinear" displacement check, the inclusion of
mat weight, the doubling of edge springs, and user input of node springs in the form of SK X HA/D
(gives 15 700 X 0.64/412 628.1 = 0.00493 for interior and doubled side nodes and 0.00493/2 =
0.00247 for doubled corner nodes). Here the only option used was doubling of the edge springs so
the output could be compared to the output from the other two methods shown on Fig. E10-5«. The
program always checks for any soil-mat separation and recycles if any nodes separate from the soil
regardless of the NONLIN input parameter.
Checking. Perform checks as follows since mat and load are symmetrical.

1. Displacement array is symmetrical. For example, corner nodes of 1,1, 1,6, 6,1, and 6,6 =
0.01107 m.
2. Moments are symmetrical. For example, the jc-moment at nodes 2,2, 2,5, 5,2, and 5, 5 =
-66.87 kN • m.
3. Since the displacements are symmetrical, the node reactions and soil pressures are also equal.
The node soil pressure at node 2,2 = SK X X(2,2) = 15 700 X 0.01146 = 179.9 kPa.
4. Note the sum of the soil reactions = 2200.396 kN versus the sum of column loads = 2200.000
kN (slight computer round-off error).


10-8 FINITE-ELEMENT METHOD FOR MAT FOUNDATIONS
In the finite-element analysis, element continuity is maintained through use of displacement
functions. The displacement function is of the form
u = ax + a2X + a3Y + a4X2 + a5XY + a6Y2 + ^7Z3 + asX2Y + a9XY2 + ^10F3
4- anX4 + anX3Y + 0I3X2F2 + auXY3 + ai5Y4 (10-12)
With a rectangular plate and three general displacements at each corner node (Fig. 10-9) only
12 unknowns of Eq. (10-12) are necessary. This results in reducing the general displacement
equation to one with 12 a,- coefficients instead of 15. Which three are best to discard becomes
a considerable exercise in both engineering judgment and computational ability/tenacity. Var-
ious procedures have been and are being periodically proposed to reduce and solve the re-
sulting matrix such as those proposed at thefinite-elementconferences at McGiIl University
(1972), Wright Patterson AFB (1965, 1968, 1971), and regular papers in several journals
including the Journal of Structural Division, ASCE.
One of the major advances in the FEM is using isoparametric element formulation so that a
given element may have more nodes than an adjacent one. In any case, the FEM output is very
difficult to interpret. Additionally the method is computationally intensive (about four times
as long to run a problem of reasonable length as the FGM of the next section). The general
methodology uses advanced mathematical concepts with which many civil and structural
engineers are not familiar so that identification of incorrect output may be difficult.
Concentrated node moments can be readily input as part of the load array; however, a nodal
statics check is difficult. The reason is that the output element node moments are in units of
moment/unit of width, whereas the input is the moment at that node. A moment summation
is not directly possible because of units incompatibility, and the situation is not helped from
having to interpret and apply the twist moment Mxy of Fig. 10-9. Similarly a vertical force
summation is not easy since element node shears are difficult to compute with the element
moments obtained on a unit width basis.
For these several reasons, the author does not recommend use of the FEM for mat and
plate problems. There are many design situations where the FEM is particularly suited; how-
ever, the FGM following is preferred for the more direct solution of foundation engineering
problems.

10-9 THE FINITE-GRID METHOD (FGM)
This method is particularly well-suited for use for the analysis of mats and plates. It has these
distinct advantages:

1. The output is easy to interpret since beam-column type elements that have only bending
and torsion are used. The moment/unit width is simply the node moment (from a node
summation) divided by the element width.
2. It is easy to obtain design shears at the ends of the elements. The shear is simply the sum
of the element end moments divided by element length. Then one divides the total element
shear by the element width to get the shear/unit width.
3. It is easy to input concentrated column moments directly.
4. Boundary cases are as easily modeled as with the FEM.
5. It is relatively simple to extend the 3 degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) nodes of this method to
use 6 d.o.f. nodes that are required for pile cap analysis [Bowles (1983)].

Although Table 10-1 (based on Fig. 10-10) established the general validity of the FGM,
users have been the ultimate test. The program (your diskette program B-6 but often supple-
mented by professionals with the data generator program B-18) has been used for silo bases
and liquid storage tank bases as well as mat foundations for buildings.1 A recent comparison
was made between the FEM and FGM for a full-scale mat foundation in Australia [Payne
et al. (1992)]. This reference compared a modification of B-6 and the commercial computer
program NASTRAN. They found a maximum difference of about 10 percent between the
stresses computed by the two methods when analyzing a mat on expansive soil. It was not
possible to identify the "correct" stress. About the best that could be done was to see if the
programs predicted crack locations reasonably well.
The FGM is similar to the beam finite element used in Chap. 9 but extended to a beam
column (which has torsion) and used for a plate. The same equations as in Sec. 9-8 are used,
namely,
P = AF e = A1X F = Se = SATX
P - ASA1X X = (ASA1 T1 P
As before, it is necessary to develop the element EA and ES matrices, with the com-
puter taking care of the remainder of the work including the building of the global ASAT
matrix.
Referring to Fig. 10-11, the element EA matrix is built by X F at each node. For example,
at node 1
P\ = F\ sin a + OF2 - F^ cos a
P^ = F\ cos a + OF2 - F3 sin a

student edition the usage has been worldwide, not just the United States.

Node springs are built during element input based on node contributory area and saved
in a "spring" array. After the global ASAT is built (in band form to save computing effort
and memory) the node springs are added at the appropriate NP location. All edge springs or,
preferably, the perimeter ks, should be doubled to approximate spring coupling.
The torsion factor J should be computed for a rectangle (see p. 528 unless a T or other
shape is involved). The adjust factor Ci is used [along with the double area (see Fig. 10-
12)] to make the solution better fit the theoretical solutions as found in Timoshenko and
Woinowsky-Krieger (1959), usually used by others to verify FEM solutions. This step is

not greatly different frd?h discarding terms in the FEM or using interpolation functions. At
present the Cl factor for a best fit is

where L, B = grid element length and width, respectively. This method has been extended
to allow triangular elements (shown in Table 10-1) and described in more detail in Bowles
(1986). As with the beam element, it is necessary to have access to the P-X coding used to
develop the EA array so the output can be interpreted.
The concept of subgrade reaction with spring contribution at nodes is easy to modify for
soil separation, since the diagonal term is the only coefficient in the stiffness matrix with the
soil spring K(i
(Au + JT1OX1- = P1
Thus, for footing separation we simply make Kt = 0, rebuild (or reuse a copy of) the stiffness
matrix, and again solve for the displacements X1-.
Generally one should include the mat weight in the analysis. The mat does not cause inter-
nal bending moments due to self-weight since the concrete is poured directly on the subbase
and in the fluid condition conforms to any surface irregularities prior to hardening. Should
the loads cause separation, however, the mat weight tends to counter this. Deflections will be
larger when including mat weight, since the soil springs react to all vertical loads.

Preliminary Work
Generally, the depth of the mat is established from shear requirements as in Example 10-6
following. This depth + clear steel cover Dc is used to compute the moment of inertia or D:
/-"3S(FEM) D = T 1 f ^ ( F E M )
The bending moments obtained from the later plate analysis are used to design the mat rein-
forcement in both directions.
Total deflections are sensitive to the value of ks used. Bending moments are much less
so, but the designer should try to use a realistic minimum and a probable maximum value
of ks and obtain at least two solutions. The design would be based on the best information
available or the worst conditions obtained from either of the two solutions (generally when
ks is minimum).

Establishing Finite-Grid Elements
(variables in brackets refer to diskette
computer program B-6.)
Begin the design by drawing the mat plan to scale and locate all columns and walls. Next lay
a grid on this plan such that grid intersections (nodes) occur at any points of zero rotation or
displacements (at column faces, wall edges, fixed edges, and similar). Use any convenient
gridding if no nodes have unknown rotations or displacements. Grid elements do not have
to be the same size, but best results are obtained if very small members are not adjacent to
large ones (e.g., a member 0.2 m long connecting to a 2-m-long member is not so satisfactory
as a 1-m connecting to a 2-m member). For pinned columns the grid can be at convenient
divisions. The load matrix is developed using both column locations and loads. Code the grid
starting at the upper left corner, across and then down. Orient the grid so a minimum number
of nodes are horizontal for minimum bandwidth.
Develop a data generator to produce element data including the member number (MEMNO)
and the six NP values for each element [NPE(I)] and H, V, and B (refer to Fig. 10-12). A
data generator (program B-18) is a necessity, since the element input data are enormous.
Develop the nonzero P-matrix entries for each load condition; use simple beam theory for
pinned columns between nodes.
Establish if any changes in soil modulus are required. These may be accounted for in the
data generator; however, for local soft spots, holes in the ground, hard spots, etc., it may be
more convenient to hand-compute the node springs to input into the spring array.
Establish the number of zero boundary conditions (NZX).
Compute the number of NPs in the matrix: NP = 3 X number of nodes; also count the
number of members (NM) to be used in the grid.
Compute the bandwidth of the matrix as follows:

1. Find the minimum NP value at various nodes.
2. Find the maximum NP value at adjacent nodes that are interconnected by grid lines.
3. Compute bandwidth as
NBAND = NPmax - NP1111n + 1


As shown on Fig. 10-12, NBAND = 2 1 - 1 + 1 = 2 1 (element 6). The size of the resulting
band matrix ISIZE is
ISIZE = NBAND X NP

The Solution Procedure
With the displacements from X = (ASAT )- 1 P wecan solveF = SATX for each element in
turn to find the element forces.
The computer program performs the necessary matrix multiplication to form the element
ESAT (ESAT) and EASAT (EASAT). The element EASAT will be of size 6 x 6 . The EASAT
is then sorted for values to be placed at the appropriate locations in the global ASAT (ASAT)
for later banding and solution. Normally the ASAT will have to be put on a disk or tape file
capable of random access.
The computer routine next recalls the ASAT from disk (or tape) and stores the band in main
memory (refer to Fig. 10-13), filling the lower right corner with zeros. Boundary conditions
are applied if specified, which result in zeroing the appropriate row and upper diagonal of
the band matrix and placing a 1.0 in the first column as shown here (typical):

With the band reduction method, the displacements are exchanged with the P matrix
at the end of the reduction. If it is desired to save the original P matrix for any reason, it
must be stored in some alternative location. The Xs (or redefined P's) are used to compute the

Bandwidth (NBAND)

F's. Also they should be scanned to see if mat-soil separation has occurred at any nodes. If
negative deflections occur (tension soil springs), the stiffness matrix is rebuilt with no springs
(K = 0) at those nodes, and the problem is cycled until the solution converges. Convergence
is understood to occur when the current number of nodes with soil separation Ni is equal to
the Ni-\ number of nodes with soil separation just used, or

Nt = N1-X
When convergence is achieved, the program then computes the element bending and torsion
forces using
F = ESATX
Here some savings in computation time can be made if the ESAT was saved to a disk file
when it was computed. But this can be done only if the node springs are added from a spring
array; otherwise the element Kt values are included in the ESAT.
It is helpful to have the program sum soil node forces (X1Ki) to compare with the input
vertical forces as a quick statics check. It is also helpful if the program makes a moment
summation (includes both bending and torsion moments) for the several elements framing
into a node for a visual X M = 0 within computer round-off at any node i (see Fig. 10-14).
These node moments can be directly used in design by dividing by the element width to
obtain moment/unit width.
Design shear requires access to a listing of element forces so the two end moment values
can be summed (with attention to sign) and divided by the element length and divided by
the element width to obtain shear/unit width. In passing we note that at any node the sum of
vertical applied force (from P matrix) + soil reaction + X sum of element shears framing to
node = 0 within computer round-off (and with attention to signs).

methods with those that would be used in conventional spread footing design of Chap. 8. A large

Ec = 22408 MPa /x = 0.15 Thus, G' = 9740MPa
Assume ks = 15 700 kN/m3 Dc = 0.60 m Double edge springs

One should use a data generator to develop member data entries, since there are 60 lines of input
containing NPE(I), H, V, B, and element soil springs. From the output, which is symmetrical from
loading, obtain the moments and deflections shown in Fig. E10-5a. The FGM program output mo-
ment for the element has been divided by B = 0.6 m to give the moment/unit width shown. Note that
you will have to use program FADMAT (B-6) on your diskette with two data sets EXAMl 05?.DTA
to obtain the output for verifying this example.
The actual moment can as easily be determined by the FGM as by the alternative methods. In
general, however, the agreement is very good from all three methods. Where the FGM differs from
the others, it is on the conservative side. There is some uncertainty as to what the correct moments
should be at node 8 since theory indicates odd plate (or membrane) behavior at this location (and
also at nodes 11,26,29).
b. Compare the moment computed by the ACI 318-suggested procedure with the FGM output.
We will do two comparisons: without column fixity (EXAM 105A.DTA) and with column fixity
(EXAM 105B.DTA). Column fixity will assume that the column limits plate rotation at the column
corner nodes (15, 16, 21, and 22) to 0.0 radians. This assumption is not unrealistic since the column
is 0.6 X 0.6 m square. For the fixed case a moment at the column face is found to be 307.1 kN • m/m,
which is larger than the 272.1 kN • m/m computed without column fixity.
The ACI column face moment will be based on an average soil pressure of q = 2200/32 =
244.4 kPa. The moment based on a moment length L = 2(0.6) = 1.2 m is
w qL

M- — ~z~ = ~

= 176 kN m/m < 272.1 kN • m/m
<^c 307.1 (for fixed column case)
This moment difference is so large that the footing has a real LF close to 1 for the USD method
and only slightly over 1.0 for the ADM. At least one non-U.S. footing design standard requires
additional reinforcing bars in the column zone for this higher-than-average moment.
c. Now let us do a statics check. For this you must have the output from using program B-6 (on
your diskette) with data file EXAM 105A.DTA. We will do a statics check at one of the column
corner nodes—node 21.


Figure E10-5a

1. From Fig. E10-5a count the elements (a partial count is shown) so the elements framing into
node 21 can be determined (here 30, 35, 36, and 41).
2. Next draw a sketch (as Fig. E10-5&) showing the elements framing into node 21 in order, and
on the end of those elements draw the bending and torsion moment vector directions. Use the (+)
directions as was done in the figure, and from the moment table in the output put the actual moment
values and signs on the vectors drawn.
Note you have "far-end" moments (second moment column) for elements 30 and 35, "near-end"
moments for elements 36 and 41. The arrowheads on the elements in Fig. E10-5Z? point toward the
"far end."
The torsion has a (-) sign if arrow is into the element and (+) if out of the element (sign con-
vention shown in Fig. 10-11).
3. Based on element moments shown, make the following computations:
XMXl = X-I = 163.3 + 0 = 163.3
Combine the end moment on element 41 and torsion from element 36:
XMX2 = X-2 = -152.6 + (-10.7) = -163.3
Combine the end moment on element 30 and torsion from element 35.
From this we see X-I = -X-2

These are the horizontal or X values that are output in the combined moment table for direct design
use (after the user divides them by element width).
Similarly, XMYl = Y-I = -163.3 + 0 = -163.3
Combine the vertical moment vector from element 35 with the torsion vector from element 30:
Likewise, XMY2 = Y-2 = 152.6 + 10.7 = 163.3
Combine the vertical moment vector from element 36 with the torsion moment from element 41:
From this we see Y-I= -Y-2 (i.e., equal and opposite)
The sums of the moments at node 21 are satisfied in both the X and Y directions. These are also the
values in the node moment table of your computer printout sheets, including sign. There may be
small differences (order of 0.01) due to computer rounding.
4. Now we will check X Fy = 0. For this draw the elements again, somewhat reoriented on Fig.
E 10-5& with the moments shown as circle arcs. Again refer to the element moment table and, using
signs, put both the near- and far-end moment values on the arcs and orient the arrowheads on the
arcs in the correct direction. Use the right-hand rule to establish directions based on Fig. 10-11.
Note that Fig. E10-5Z? shows both the arrowheads in correct direction and the moments labeled
with a sign. With the moments on both ends of the element properly oriented, compute the element
end shears (there will be a value at each end with one vector up and the other down). You need the
moment orientation to get the shear vector signs (or arrowheads) in the correct direction.
Noting that element forces act on the node in the opposite direction, we can draw the node as in
the lower left corner of Fig. E10-5& and for this node there is an external force (a P matrix entry)
of />63 = 550 kN acting as shown. Putting the several element end shears and the output value of
spring force of 66.83 kN from the element moment table (its direction is known, as it always resists
downward movement) on node 21, we sum forces and find that the shear -f soil reaction gives
^ F \ = 241.58 + 241.58 + 0. + 0. + 66.83 = 549.99 kN
and
] T Fl = 550 kN (or 549.99 « 550)
This completes the statics check. We have found that the sum of X moments is the same with
opposite signs; the sum of the Y moments is the same with opposite signs; and the sum of vertical
node forces ~ 0.
One final note: The moments shown in the node moment table will have a sign reversal for the
node. For design divide the node moments by the element width and, on the basis of signs for the
element (or the node displacements), you can determine if the top or bottom of the plate has tension;
sometimes there is tension in one direction and compression in the other at a node.
5. The element shear values can be used to check two-way action as follows: For either element
35 or 41 (30 and 36 are column elements) we have V = 241.58 kN for a width B = 0.6 m. This
shear is constant over the element length L. Dc = 0.60 m so, assuming 70 mm of clear cover and a
25-mm reinforcing bar, the depth d = 505 mm or 0.505 m. At dfl from the column face we have
(two-way shear vc = 1.298 MPa for /c' = 21 MPa from Table 8-2)
Resisting shear = vcdb = 1.298(0.505)(0.6O)(1000, to convert MN to kN) = 393.3 kN
Actual shear = 241.6 kN <§c 393.3 kN Two-way shear is O.K.
The footing could probably be made with a smaller Dc but as this decreases, the shear at the
column face will increase. You could make one or more trials using data set EXAMl05A.DTA
edited for slab thickness to find an optimum depth d.

Example 10-6. Make a comparison of soil pressure for the notched footing shown in Fig. E10-6
for the following three cases: (1) no notch, (2) a notch but no column fixity, and (3) for notch
with column fixed. You should use your program B-6 together with data sets EXAM106.DTA,
EXAM106A.DTA, and EXAM106B.DTA from your diskette. Use the output to verify data shown
on Fig. E10-5 and for other locations as well. Although the data are assembled into data sets for
your convenience the given data are
Column: 600 X 600 mm with an axial load P = 2400 kN
Footing: BxB = 3.038 X 3.038 m less the corner notch of dimensions shown in
Fig. E10-6
Other: fc = 21 MPa Ec = 21700MPa /JL = 0.15
Dc = 510 mm qa = 260 kPa (sandy-gravelly clay)
Solution. Draw the footing to a large scale and place a grid on it as shown in Fig. E10-6. Try to use
symmetry as shown so the output will be somewhat self-checking. Also use enough nodes/elements
that there is confidence in the output. I used program B-18 (an element data generator) to produce
the element data on a disk file, which was then put into the first B-6 data file (EXAM105.DTA)
using the subroutine in B-6 that requests input from the screen when a data file does not exist. Input
a 1 at the request location when queried about element data, and later use your editor to include the
element data and remove the information line in the data set for B-6. Before editing the output from


program B-18, use the element data set to set up the file for the unnotched base. Next, edit a copy of
the data set to create the notch case (by removing some elements and modifying widths of certain
others, we have the element data for the notched base). For this we obtain
NP = 186 Number of elements NM = 108
NBAND = 27 - 1 + 1 = 27 (using element 8)
ks = 40(SF)?a = 40(3)(260) = 31200kN/m3
G'= 2 ( T T ^ T 2 ( ^ 5 ) «5435-JMOO MP.
For fixing the column it is necessary to identify the rotational NPs at the column corner nodes
and specify rotation = 0.0 rad. There are eight rotational displacements, of which the last two
are 109 and 110, shown on Fig. E10-6. Again we can see that the footing is not quite rigid, for the
displacements are larger under the column. Also notice that fixing the column nodes against rotation
tends to smooth out the vertical displacements so that the soil pressure is more uniform beneath the
footing.
Fixing the column substantially increases the bending moment at the column face over that
determined by the pinned column analysis.

Example 10-7. An elevated storage bin carrying a total load of 35 600 kN [including bin contents
(when full), bin, and columns] is shown in Fig. E10-7a. Since steel might require excessive main-
tenance at this geographic location, reinforced concrete square columns of 760 X 760 mm are used.
The soil data for this example are those of Examples 10-1 and 10-2.
We will use column fixity (owing to column dimensions). We should not double the edge springs
to account for soil coupling when we have a mat with more than two column loads.

Required, Make an approximate mat design. Use your program B-6 (FADMAT) and data file
EXAM107.DTA on your diskette to rerun and obtain a set of output. Be careful, however, since
the paper output (using 14^ X 11 in. sheets) totals 15 pages [not including the element data list pro-
duced when using program B-18, which is about 4 pages, or from setting program control parameter
ICHECK = 1 (col 40 in 2nd dataline)].

Solution.
Step 1. Use a load factor LF = 1.5 on loads to convert to ultimate since there is some uncertainty
whether the bin contents may be both long-term and transient. The bin and columns are, of course,
dead loads with an ACI LF = 1.4.
Step 2. Find tentative mat dimensions. This calculation is no different from the method used in
Chap. 8 for spread footings. From the loads and geometry of Fig. 10-7« we will try a square mat:
/ p
B2qa = P -» B = / — (use working loads)

This slight increase in area serves two purposes: (1) It allows for trucks driving through to load
from the hopper; (2) it gives a slight decrease in qo since the mat will probably be rather thick when
carrying an 8900 kN column load.


/;. = 28 MPa jy = 400 MPa (mat rebars)
qu = 250 kPa (from Example 10-1)
ks = 4700 kN/m3 (from Example 10-2)

G'=2(ll7I) = 2frS5)=1 0 8 1 0 M P a

Figure E10-7a

Step 3. Find the depth for two-way action. We will use the approximate formula [Eq. (8-8)] since
these are large loads and that equation is slightly conservative:
Ad2 + 2(w + w)d = Puit/i;c
Obtain^ = 1.499 MPa from Table 8-2 for/c' = 28 MPa; the column dimensions w = 760 mm =
0.76 m and substitution of values give

Simplifying, we obtain

d2 + 0.16d - 2.226 = 0
Solving, we find d = 1.16m(1160 mm). With a 30-mm rebar each direction + 70 mm of clear
cover the total estimated depth is
Dc = 1160 + 30 + 70 = 1260 mm (1.260 m) as first trial
We could use a thinner base with shear reinforcement but this is difficult both to design and to
place and would produce a less rigid mat. We will (or at least try to) use this mat thickness and plan
dimensions.
Step 4. From the mat plan dimensions locate the columns (draw to approximate scale) and place the
grid lines as shown in Fig. E10-7Z?. Since the columns are large they should be "fixed" to the base.
Thus, grid lines must pass through their faces. The remainder should be made as symmetrical as
possible and should be chosen to produce elements of reasonable length. For example, the elements

would be too long (and adjacent to 0.76 mm lengths) if we did not divide the 4.90 m space between
column faces as shown or the exterior spacing of 2.79 m into two element lengths of 1.395 m each.
This gridding scheme results in 121 nodes and 220 elements. This large number of elements will
require an element data generator or an extremely long time to input.
From the P-X coding we find that, to fix the columns by setting the two corner rotations = 0 for
each of the four column nodes and with four columns, we have
NZX = 4 X 2 X 4 = 32 (8 rotations of X = 0 at each column)
Number of elements NM = 220
Number of NP = number of nodes X 3 = 121 X 3 = 363
The bandwidth can be computed from element 11 as
NBAND = 36 - 1 + 1 = 36
The P matrix entries will be four values per column for a total of
NNZP = 4 X 4 = 16 entries
There are two load cases: (1) gravity, (2) gravity 4- wind, so
LC = 2

Zone boundaries
with ks values shown
for Problem 10-8


For input we have to identify the NP value. A set of P values is input for each load case in turn
(refer to the data set). For load case 1 gravity loads Pgravity we have
35 600 kN using 4 columns with 4 nodes per column, so
P value = 35 600/(4 X 4) = 2225 kN
For the load case with wind we will take overturning clockwise as shown on Fig. E10-7«. Note that
if the bin is round, wind can come from any direction with the force and y (of 18 m) shown. It is
possible that a more critical loading case obtains with the wind moment taken about an axis through
columns 3 and 2. For wind as shown the moment is
M = Pwy = 1070 X 18 = 19260 kN • m
The equivalent vertical force is P' = 19 260/(4.90 + 0.76) = 3402.8 kN. This is divided between
two columns on each side, so P" = 1701.4 kN.
Thus the wind moment decreases the vertical load in the windward columns and increases the
load in the leeward columns. Typically,
PL = 8900 + 1701.4 = 10601.4 kN
Pw = 8 9 0 0 - 1701.4 = 7198.6 kN
The vertical P matrix entry for each column node
on the leeward side = 10601.4/4
= 2650.4 kN
P matrix entry for windward side = 7198.6/4 = 1799.6 kN
For columns 1 and 2 we have

NP Pgravity, kN F ^ , kN
25 X 3 = 75 2225.0 1799.6
26 X 3 = 78 2225.0 1799.6
30 X 3 = 90 2225.0 2650.4
31 x 3 = 93 2225.0 2650.4
36 X 3 = 108 2225.0 1799.6
37X3 = 111 2225.0 1799.6
41 x 3 = 123 2225.0 2650.4
42 X 3 = 126 2225.0 2650.4
• • • etc.

At column 1 we have rotation NPs of
73, 74 (75 is translation); 76, 77 (78 is translation);
106, 107 (108 is translation); and 109, 110 (111 is translation)
We should, of course, put these in sequence to minimize program error, not as shown above for
illustration of locating the NP numbers where rotation is specified = 0.
You should obtain a direct printout of the data file (several pages in length) to see how the data
given here are organized.
Step 5. We must inspect the node moment data, which also include actual soil pressures at nodes
and node moments. None of the nodes for load case 1 has a soil pressure q > 248.8 kPa (you should


check your output for load case 2). Remember for LC = 2 you have wind, so it is usual to allow an
actual q > qa (how much greater may require discussion with the geotechnical consultant). Here,
if q < l.33qa consider the soil pressures acceptable.
Make a routine inspection of X M ~ 0 at nodes and
^ Fv « 0 for the entire structure
That is, check if 35 600 input = sum of soil spring reactions (here on the author's computer
35 599.99 kN was output).
Step 6. Compute the required rebars for one node location. From a reasonable examination of the
output (LC = 1 ) find the following:
Node 25: M = 1981.3 with an element width = (1.395 + 0.76)/2 = 1.08 m
Node 26: M = 1522.9 with an element width = (1.225 + 0.76)/2 = 0.99 m
M25 = 1981.3/1.08 = 1834.5 kN-m/m
M26 = 1522.9/0.99 = 1538.3 kN • m/m
Using 1834.5 kN • m/m to find As in both the horizontal and vertical plan orientation in the column
regions in the bottom of the mat, we compute using Eq. (8-2) as follows:

, / , _ a\_ Mu Asfy
Y 2) <t>fyXl000 a 0.85(fc)/c'
For /c' = 28 MPa and fy = 400 MPa, we then have

Solving (remember that 1834.5 kN • m/m is an unfactored design value), we have (using d —
1.26 - 0.030 - 0.070 = 1.16 m from step 3)
A,(1.16-8.40^) = ,j^TfoOO
Simplifying, we obtain
A2 -0.138A, + 0.00091 = 0
Solving, we find A, = 0.006943 m2/m -> 6943 mm2/m. This requires 6943/700 = 10 No. 30 bars
with a spacing of
s = 1000/10 = 100 mm (seems satisfactory)
For a minimum As based on lA/fy -> 1.4/400 = 0.0035, we have
A,,min = 0.0035(100O)(1.16 X 1000) = 4060mm2/m
This computation indicates that most of the mat will require only the minimum percentage of rebars.
Only the column zones using a zone distance of about d from each face (2 X 1.16 + 0.76) = 3.84
m centered on each column and each way using 10 No. 30 rebars is required. For the remainder of
the mat use six No. 30 reinforcing bars (6 X 700 = 4200 > 4060 required).
Note there is much additional work to be done to complete this design. Even though the minimum
percentage of rebars may control, you will have to use them as top bars in zones of ( - ) moment (top
tension).


10-11 MAT-SUPERSTRUCTURE INTERACTION
One may include the superstructure rigidity into the problem, as was done in a semiempirical
manner using Eq. (10-3), which requires a substantial amount of hand computations.
We may use a regular frame analysis program and add a beam-on-elastic-foundation sub-
routine so that the global ASAT matrix includes nodes for the frame and the foundation. Now
one can make a direct solution for node displacements in both the frame and base and from
these compute bending moments for the frame and base for design.
Few computer programs do superstructure-foundation coupling at present because of the
ease of banding a frame program and the separate narrow bandwidth of a beam-on-elastic
foundation. When both the foundation and superstructure are included, the bandwidth may
become rather large; however, modern computers can handle large stiffness arrays so size is
not a major problem.
We could even do the coupling for a space frame; however, these usually have nodes with
6 d.o.f in the superstructure and do not interface well with the plate where the nodes have 3
d.o.f.
Probably as good a solution as any is to do the following:

1. Code and make an analysis of the superstructure to obtain the axial column forces and
applicable column base bending moment(s). Assume a fixed-base condition.
2. Code the foundation (mat or combined footing) with nodes at the superstructure columns.
Now use the output from step 1 as the input of this step and make a solution. You will
obtain node vertical translations and rotations at the column nodes.
3. Use these data from step 2 as boundary conditions for a rerun of step 1. That is, specify
vertical displacement and rotation of the one or more columns. Obtain a new set of axial
forces and moments, which are input for step 2.
4. Continue to iterate until the axial forces and moments used are within some specified
tolerance (closeness) to the preceding cycle. At this point you have a reasonably good
solution for both the superstructure and the foundation.

10-12 CIRCULAR MATS OR PLATES
Circular plates are commonly used for industrial process tower bases (see Example 9-4) and
for chimneys. They may also be used to support silos and other similar superstructures. There
are few closed-form solutions for a circular plate on an elastic foundation. Timoshenko and
Woinowsky-Krieger (1959) give theoretical solutions for a simply supported and a fixed-edge
support circular plate but none for a plate on an elastic foundation. Chu and Afandi (1966)
and Smith and Zar (1964) provided some practical methods for circular plate (for chimneys)
design involving empirical procedures.
The FEM using triangular elements can be used to analyze a circular plate by gridding
it into a series of triangles. The particular disadvantage of this is that the moments at the
center of any triangle are usually output rather than node values. Since the FEM is difficult
to interpret anyway, this creates a truly difficult situation for most designers.
The FGM given here can be fixed (reprogrammed) to solve a circular plate. Referring
to Fig. 10-15, we grid the circular plate as shown with radial lines. This gridding produces
triangles for the central portion with a common node 1. Next we produce chord-type elements
along the circular grid lines. The elements are converted to rectangular elements of average

width and average length, and the same equations (and ASAT formulation) are used as for the
rectangular FGM. We note that one-quarter of a plate with the radial lines shown produces
NP = 75, but more critical is the bandwidth. It is always determined from the central part,
which gives for the figure NBAND = 21 - 1 + 1 = 21; for one-half the plate NBAND =
36 — 1 -h 1 = 36. If there are more radial lines, of course, the bandwidth becomes larger.
Fortunately, it is seldom necessary to have to use more than one-half the plate. A half-plate
is necessary for the overturning case.
Since the element formulation is extremely difficult, it is advantageous to use an element
data generator, code one-half the plate, and use that element data for all load cases.
The circular gridding does not have to use an equally divided radius, so that with the P-X
coding shown it is easy to place one of the circular grid lines at the face of the pedestal or
chimney. By careful coding, the elements inside the pedestal/column face grid can have their
additional stiffness included into the global stiffness matrix.
To compute the soil springs a special procedure is required that must take into account the
contributing arc segment area to any node. The element generator computes the several arc
segments and saves them in an array so that they can be multiplied either by the modulus
of subgrade reaction ks to obtain node springs or by yDc to obtain plate self-weight for the
several nodes.
A nonlinear subroutine can be activated for X > XMAX or for soil-base separation. When
the soil-base separation stabilizes (number of nodes separated does not change from previous

cycle), one can plot a line approximating the zero-pressure line to see how much of the plate
is "effective" in carrying the load.
A pair of programs [B-20, B-21 (element generator)] regularly used by the author for the
circular plate has been tested using the simple edge support and fixed edge support plate
solutions for comparison, with quite good results. The effect of doubling edge springs (or
preferably doubling the edge ks) can be easily shown to be correct. A round, uniformly
loaded plate without edge springs doubled gives a nearly uniform vertical displacement with
moments nearly zero around the center. Doubling edge springs gives edge displacements
approximately 0.64SHcen and plate moments that are greater than zero with the magnitude
dependent on the uniform load. To model a uniform load, input a unit weight y such that
y X plate thickness T gives the desired pressure. For flexible plates the center displacements
compute nearly exactly according to theory. The theoretical center displacement using Eq.
(5-16) is
AH = qD]—-^mIsIF (5-16)
where terms not previously identified in Eq. (5-16) are
D = plate diameter, m or ft
Is = shape factor for round base
= 1 for center
= 0.64 for edge
= 0.79 to 0.88 for a "rigid" circular plate
m = 1.0

It should be evident that one can find a plate thickness to satisfy "rigid" criteria by simply
varying the plate thickness T.
The difference in hand and computer analysis of a round foundation will now be illustrated
using the industrial tower footing of Example 9-4 as a circular plate. In Example 10-8 we
double edge springs by doubling the outer input value of ks. This method is the most precise
since it is the only one to produce exterior node soil pressures that are correct (i.e., include
both edge shear and bearing pressure).
The particular advantage of coding the nodes using radial and tangential rotation NPs is
that the edge fixity is much easier to program. Of course for a chimney or pedestal resting
on a plate, it will be necessary to be able to fix rotations of a series of interior nodes along
some circular grid path. The radial rotations are usually those that are zero when specifying
boundary conditions required when using a 1/4 or 1/2 plate from symmetry.

Step 2. There are several load cases to consider. Here for illustration, only the case of working
gravity load + wind will be analyzed. We will use symmetry and only analyze 1/2 the base, as
shown in Fig. E10-8a. For this the gravity load from the vessel is
Total Load = 580 kN -> use 580/2 = 290 kN


For 9 full nodes and 2 half-nodes (on the line of symmetry) the gravity load is
P1- = 290/10 = 29.0 kN (full node—nodes 3-11)
= 29.0/2 = 14.5 kN (1/2 nodes—nodes 2 and 12)
The P matrix will be developed for 1/2 the base, as shown in the following table. Refer to both Figs.
E10-8« and b for obtaining the NP numbers and both the gravity (vessel) and wind loads shown.

NP Vessel, kN Wind Moment, kN Z = P matrix, kN

6 14.5 159.2 = 173.7
9 29.0 151.4 180.4
12 29.0 128.8 157.8
15 29.0 93.6 122.6
18 29.0 49.1 78.1
21 29.0 0.0 29.0
24 29.0 -49.1 -20.1
27 29.0 -93.6 -64.6
30 29.0 -128.8 -99.8
33 29.0 -151.4 -122.4
36 14.5 - 159.2 - 144.7
E =2900 =0.0 = 290.0

Refer to the computations shown in Fig. E10-8Z? for the wind moment entries. Other types of over-
turning moment would be similarly computed.
The base + backfill + pedestal weights will be accounted for by inputting pedestal H = 1.5 +
0.70 = 2.2 m with yc = 23.6 kN/m3.
For the base, input T = 0.7 m with an equivalent unit weight based on the soil depth over the
base of 1.5 m and base thickness of 0.70 m, giving
0.70 X 23.6 + 1.50 X 16.5 __ 3
7e = QT = 58.96 kN/m3
The total weight will be slightly different from Example 9-4 since we are using a "round" base here
whereas in that example we used an octagon. For checking we should have:
] T F, = 0.7854(2.32)(1.5 + 0.7)(23.6) + 0.7854(6.602 - 2.302)(0.7)58.96 + 580
= 215.7 + 1240.5 + 580 = 2036.2
For 1/2 the base the vertical force F = 2036.2/2 = 1018.1 kN
Step 3. Check computer output. The output (Fig. E10-8c) shows the sum of soil springs:
Fv = 1018.8 kN « 1018.1 input and is O.K.
We can see from the output that there are no nodes where there is soil-base separation. The soil
pressure beneath the base is fairly uniform in the interior. The soil pressure at node 1 is somewhat
meaningless, but looking at several other nodes, we have the following pressure values:

A2 = 2.30cosl8 = 2.187 m
A3 = 2.30cos36 = 1.861m
A4 = 2.30 cos 54 = 1.352 m
A5 = 2.30cos72 = 0.711m
And for \ wind moment at top of ring M = 131.14(33.5/2)/2 = 1098.2 kN • m

Substituting for P, into Eq. (a) we obtain
2.30P6 + 2.08P6 + 1.506P6 + 0.795P6 + 0.219P6 = 1098.5
P6 = 1098.5/6.901 = 159.2 kN

The soil pressures show the effects of the pedestal on "fixing" the base slab. They also show (and
based on Example 9-4) that the depth is substantially more than is required for either wide-beam or
two-way shear. The high edge node pressures at nodes 24 and 34 result from doubling ks instead of
doubling the soil springs.
Step 4. Find the amount of steel reinforcing required. The radial moment at the face of the pedestal
is

The tangential moment at the face of the pedestal (node 2 and element 32):
TMl = Mt = 15.35 kN • M for an element width of 0.258 m
= 15.35A258 = 59.5 kN • m/m <- use for design
Applying an LF = 1.5 the design moment = 1.5 X 59.5 = 89.2 kN • m/m. From inspection of
the element moment table it appears that there are moments producing "tension" in the top of the
slab. This table also shows that the largest element bending moments are under the pedestal, but
they would not be used for design, since the effective depth here is so large that the minimum steel
requirements will control. Critical design moments will be found between element numbers 32 and
73. Since we know that the amount of rebars required in Example 9-4 was based on \A/fy and the
moments here are substantially less, it is evident that lA/fy will control here as well. Therefore the
rebar (with d = 605 mm from Example 9-4) requirements are
M = i d = 0.0035 and A5 = 0.0035 X 1000 X 605 = 2118 mm2/m
fy 400
Use 7 No. 30 bars (7 X 300 = 2100 mm2), radiating from approximately the center to the edge
in all directions. Circular (tangential) rebars of the same size and quantity should also be placed for
the small twisting moments.
Step 5. Estimate tower tilt. From the computer output we have for the three critical pedestal nodes
(1,2, and 12) the following displacements:

Node Vertical displacement, m
12 0.003330
1 0.003359
2 0.003382

The slope is obtained from plotting to a large vertical scale; however, a fairly good value can be
obtained by taking the displacements at nodes 2 and 12 divided by the pedestal width of 2.30 m to
obtain

6= 0 0 0 3 3 8 2

2 3 0

0 0 0 3 3 3 ° = 0.0000226 rad

The tower top movement referenced to the bottom of the base (refer to Fig. E9-4a) is
8H = HO = (33.5 + 0.30 + 1.50 + 0.70) X 0.0000226 X 1000 = 0.81 mm
This amount is negligible, but would probably be larger if we tried to save on concrete by using a
hollow pedestal and a thinner base.
The pedestal rotations could have been specified as zero using boundary conditions but were not.
Probably an execution should have been made setting them to zero (both radial and tangential) and
seeing the effect on the output.
Note that the approximate solution of Example 9-4 does not provide a different design (unless
we want to use a hollow pedestal with a wall thickness of about 200 mm and reduce the base slab
thickness) from the one used here. This analysis, however, gives more confidence in soil pressures
and tower tilt.


10-13 BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
We have identified boundary conditions of zero rotation or zero displacement. For example,
in Example 10-6 we fixed the rotation at the column face nodes to input a total of 32 rotations
that were set to zero. We used "boundary conditions" based on symmetry in the round plate
analysis by fixing select rotation NPs along the diameter.
Table 10-1 was prepared using boundary conditions to solve only a portion of a plate. One
does not arbitrarily select boundary conditions. Rather, one examines the problem carefully to
decide intuitively where a nodal rotation will be zero from fixity or from symmetry. Similarly
one must recognize when a translation will be zero (as at a fixed edge). For example, if we
only solved 1/4 of the circular base of Fig. 10-15 we would specify the radial rotation equals
zero at all the horizontal and vertical nodes that are adjacent to the other 3/4 of the base.
At the center node both rotation Xs would be set to zero. Except at the center, the tangential
node rotations would not be set to zero. This convention complies with the concept of sym-
metrical displacements of the full plate so that what one has done produces a correct solution.
If one sets boundary conditions to zero that are not consistent with the element model, one
can get some strange computed results. For any plate supported only on an elastic foundation,
no vertical displacements would be set to zero.
Although the foregoing boundary cases are valid for a symmetrical vertical load, when one
has overturning the amount of plate involved for a symmetrical set of displacements changes;
one usually must use 1/2 the plate. Example 10-7 was symmetrical for the first load case (four
equal loads and symmetrical column spacing), so we could have used only one-quarter of the
mat with appropriate zeroing of rotation NPs. However, with wind we would have had to use
half the plate. In this case, after considering the difficulty in creating a data file, one is better
off to start with half the plate so the data can simply be copied and select entries edited.
If symmetry does not exist for all possible load cases, one probably should ignore sym-
metry. The additional engineering time to produce extra data sets for the several cases +
identification of nodes with symmetry and to do a closer output check will more than offset
the slight savings in computational effort— particularly at current costs for computer time.

CHAPTER

LATERAL EARTH PRESSURE

11-1 THE LATERAL EARTH PRESSURE PROBLEM
Lateral earth pressure is a significant design element in a number of foundation engineering
problems. Retaining and sheet-pile walls, both braced and unbraced excavations, grain in silo
walls and bins, and earth or rock contacting tunnel walls and other underground structures
require a quantitative estimate of the lateral pressure on a structural member for either a
design or stability analysis.
The method of plastic equilibrium as defined by the Mohr rupture envelope of Figs. 2-24
and 11-Ia is most generally used for estimating the lateral pressure from earth and other ma-
terials such as grain, coal, and ore. On occasion one may use the finite-element (of the elastic
continuum) method but this has several distinct disadvantages for most routine design. The
FEM has more application for estimating pressure on tunnel liners and large buried conduits
than for most lateral pressure analyses.
Earth pressures are developed during soil displacements (or strains) but until the soil is on
the verge of failure, as defined by the Mohr's rupture envelope (see Fig. 11-la), the stresses
are indeterminate. They are also somewhat indeterminate at rupture since it is difficult to
produce a plastic equilibrium state in a soil mass everywhere simultaneously—most times
it is a progressive event. Nevertheless, it is common practice to analyze rupture as an ideal
state occurrence, both for convenience and from limitations on obtaining the necessary soil
parameters with a high degree of reliability.
Referring to Fig. 11-la, we see two circles that are common to point A and tangent to the
rupture line. Both these circles represent a state of plastic equilibrium in plane strain. One of
the other circles such as EA or AF would be a steady-state K0 condition depending on the
overconsolidation ratio (OCR) defined by Eq. (2-13) (with discussion in Sec. 2-8).

11-2 ACTIVE EARTH PRESSURE
Active earth pressure refers to the plastic equilibrium state defined by rupture circle AC of
Fig. 11-la. This equilibrium state is obtained from Fig. W-Ib and c as follows. First apply


{a) Mohr's circles for the K0 and at plastic equilibrium (or rupture).

Elastic

[b) Initial K0 state. (c) Active pressure. (d) Passive pressure.
Figure 11-1 Illustration of the concept of elastic and plastic equilibrium. Note in both (c) and (d) the slip lines
are highly idealized. The stresses in (b), (c), and (d) such as OA, OE, EC are identified on the Mohr's circles of
(a).

stresses OA and OE such that the initial K0 condition is obtained. Next gradually decrease
OE to failure at OC. Stresses OA (maximum) and OC (minimum) can be used to plot a
Mohr's circle. The difference between OA and OC is the circle diameter and is also the
deviator stress as might be obtained in a laboratory GK0UE triaxial test (see Fig. 2-40, case
2). The slip lines form as shown, since the horizontal and vertical planes defining the soil
element in Fig. 1 \-\b are principal planes when the K0 state is developed. The latter is based
on mechanics of materials and is independent of material; however, observations of model
walls in sand indicates the slip-line angle of 45° + </>/2 shown is approximately developed.
The minimum principal stress OC = a^ is termed the active earth pressure and can be
computed using Eq. (2-55), repeated here for convenience:
o-3 = (T1 tan2 (45° - | J - 2ctan(45° - | J (2-55)
This equation was developed by Coulomb about 1776 in a considerably different form;
Bell (1915) appears to be the first published source of the equation in the above form. This
equation is often written in European literature with the following trigonometric relationships
for the tangent function:


Wall of zero volume

Normally
consolidated
cohesionless
soil

Dredge line

(a) (6) Active case. (c) Passive case.
Figure 11-2 Idealization of active and passive earth pressure from a K0 developed by inserting a wall of zero
thickness (and volume) into a soil mass as in (a).
It is also usual to use Ka for the tan2 term as shown previously in Fig. 4-2 and regularly
used in this chapter. For the tan(45° + 0/2) (passive) values of the next section, reverse the
signs of the sine ratio terms.
Let us investigate the practical implications of Fig. 11-1 by using Fig. 11-2. In Fig. 11-2
we have inserted a wall of zero thickness into a normally consolidated; isotropic, cohesionless
soil mass (we could use any soil but this simplifies the discussion). At this point we have a
K0 stress state on the wall; and the lateral (soil-to-wall or wall-to-soil) pressure is, from the
definition of K0,
(73 = KOCT\
and is triangular since at any depth z the vertical pressure a\ = yz. If we assume the soil is
normally consolidated, K0 can be defined by one of the qualitative stress ratios of Fig. 11 -Ia
as
K - °E
Now let us excavate the soil on the left side of the wall of Fig. 1 \-2a to the depth H in Fig.
W-Ib and c. If the wall does not shear off at point B (termed the dredge line) the wall will do
one of the following:

1. Deflect laterally under the cantilever beam loading causing slip planes to form in the soil as
in Fig. 11 -1 c. The lateral pressure cr^ = 0-3 on the Mohr's circle plot moves from E toward
O. The Fig. 11-Ic case develops since the K0 pressure exerted on the wall decreases as it
deflects away from (but is followed by) the soil behind the wall.
If the wall displacement is sufficient, the lateral pressure reaches plastic equilibrium at
OC and the wall pressure is a minimum (termed active pressure case) defined from Eq.
(2-55) as
ah = (T\Ka (since c = 0)
This minimum pressure case can be explained from observing that the slip wedge is a
minimum volume at 45° + 4>/2 from the horizontal. That is, the slope of the line from C
to the point of tangency of Fig. H-Ia is also the slope of line BC of Fig. 11-2Z?. The shear
resistance developed on line BC of Fig. \\-2b also reduces the tendency of the wedge
ABC to push against the wall.
If the lateral displacement (8^fl) is limited (by a brace, prop, or wall stiffness), the wall
pressure becomes indeterminate but is intermediate between the K0 and Ka pressures


(pressures OE and OC of Fig. W-Xa). The reason is that soil requires some limiting strain
to mobilize the maximum shear resistance on the slip planes. This active pressure case is
approximately illustrated as case 2 of Fig. 2-40 since Fig. 11 -2b shows the wall rotating
about the base B, whereas Fig. 2-40 shows a wall translation. Wall pressures depend on
both wall movement and mode of movement.
2. Not deflect at all if the wall is sufficiently rigid and in this case the lateral pressure remains
at
ah = yzKo
Since a lateral displacement of the wall produces a state of active earth pressure at the
point where the wall pressure reduces to a minimum, we might ask what happens if there
is no wall. In this case we have cr3 = o^ = 0, and it is evident that if the soil resistance
mobilized on the slip plane (as BC of Fig. ll-2b) is not sufficient to satisfy statics of the
wedge ABC the soil will slip into the excavation. This action can be readily observed in a
small excavation in dry sand where the sides form slopes at some angle with the horizontal.
It should also be evident that as a hole is opened the surrounding soil will immediately
displace laterally along similar slip planes into the cavity. When this shift happens, any device
inserted into the hole must first "push" this displaced soil back to its original location before
the in situ state is reproduced. It turns out that pushing the soil back to its original location is
nearly impossible and, additionally, we introduce changes in the soil structure. This makes it
very difficult to measure K0 in any excavated hole—including boreholes.
Since the wall must displace/rotate laterally away from the soil being retained to produce
active (or Ka) earth pressure conditions, the question is, how much rotation is necessary? This
has been modestly investigated and the following may be used as a guide:

Soil and condition Amount of translation, 8h>a
Cohesionless, dense 0.001 to 0.002//
Cohesionless, loose 0.002 to 0.004//
Cohesive, firm 0.01 to 0.02//
Cohesive, soft 0.02 to 0.05//

As previously stated, if there is not sufficient lateral displacement, the wall pressure is
indeterminate between K0 and Ka. Most walls are designed for resisting active earth pressure
since any rotation that tends to produce failure is usually large enough to allow the active (or
minimum) pressure to develop. If the wall is rigid or if top rotation may be undesirable for
aesthetic reasons, the wall is designed for higher (usually for K0) wall pressures. Even in this
case if the wall starts into failure mode some rotation/translation will take place and the lateral
pressure will start a reduction toward the Ka state. Failures of structural walls are most likely
to occur during backfilling where compaction of the backfill with heavy rollers may induce
a lateral pressure too large for the wall to support. Only in excavations do the conditions
approximate Fig. 11-2«, b. In these cases the wall is usually installed then excavated to some
depth. Lateral bracing is then installed and the excavation continued to another depth, bracing
installed, etc. The lateral pressure retained by the wall should be at least K0 or somewhat
larger; otherwise the ground around the excavation sinks and if structures are in the settling
zone they crack and lawsuits result.


Lateral pressure bh

11-3 PASSIVEEARTHPRESSURE
The passive earth pressure state is given by the larger Mohr's circle of Fig. 11-la. This
state is developed by obtaining K0 conditions of Fig. 11-lfc and holding OA constant while
increasing the lateral pressure from OE to the plastic equilibrium failure at OD (and the case
4 situation of Fig. 2-40). The slip planes in the soil now make angles that are 45° — $/2 with
the horizontal and are cf> from the active state. This slip angle orientation is shown by the line
from D to the point of tangency of the large Mohr's circle of Fig. 1 l-la.
The major principal stress OD = a\ can be computed from the geometry of Mohr's circle
similarly as for the active pressure case to obtain Eq. (2-54) of Sec. 2-11:
ax = CJ3 tan2 J45° + | J 4- 2c tan J45° + | J (2-54)
Passive earth pressure developed by increasing the lateral pressure from OE to OD of Fig.
HAb and d is analogous to pushing the wall of Fig. 11-2c into the soil. Again the soil under-
goes deformation and with sufficient deformation the maximum shear resistance is mobilized;
however, note these points:

1. The resisting passive wedge volume is substantially larger.
2. The mobilized shear resistance s reverses direction to increase the wall force. The shear
direction of the active case assists in reducing the wall force.

The change in the resisting wedge ABC of Figs. ll-2b, c is the principal reason why a wall
that moves forward to the minimum active pressure case cannot be pushed back to its original
position.
Figure 11-3 illustrates the relative movements and order of magnitude of the lateral earth
pressure coefficients defined by the trigonometric ratios of Eqs. (2-54) and (2-55). Typically,
passive earth pressure is developed by anchor plates or blocks embedded in the soil with a
tension rod or cable oriented so that the cable pulls the block against the soil. Another case
of passive pressure is the soil below the dredge line of Fig. 11-2, which must resist the wall

moving forward from point B down so that active pressure can develop behind the wall from
the soil wedge defined by line BC.
This discussion has been theoretical to this point. We must now develop a means to apply
these principles in a general way to evaluate what the earth pressure will be for specific appli-
cations. There are currently two general procedures for soil masses and a theory of elasticity
method for loads on the soil mass that is to be resisted by the wall. These methods will be
considered in the following several sections.

11-4 COULOMB EARTH PRESSURE THEORY
One of the earliest methods for estimating earth pressures against walls, credited to C. A.
Coulomb (ca. 1776), made a number of assumptions as follows:

1. Soil is isotropic and homogeneous and has both internal friction and cohesion.
2. The rupture surface is a plane surface (as BC of Fig. 11 -2b) and the backfill surface is
planar (it may slope but is not irregularly shaped).
3. The friction resistance is distributed uniformly along the rupture surface and the soil-to-
soil friction coefficient / = tan 4>.
4. The failure wedge is a rigid body undergoing translation.
5. There is wall friction, i.e., as the failure wedge moves with respect to the back face of the
wall a friction force develops between soil and wall. This friction angle is usually termed 8.
6. Failure is a plane strain problem—that is, consider a unit interior slice from an infinitely
long wall.

The principal deficiencies in the Coulomb theory are the assumptions that the soil is ideal
and that the rupture zone is a plane (although for clean sand in the active pressure case,
photographs of model walls indicate the rupture zone is very nearly a plane as BC of Fig.
11-26).
The equations based on the Coulomb theory for a cohesionless soil can be derived from
Figs. 11-4 and 11-5, using a large number of trigonometric relationships. The weight of the
soil wedge ABE, for a unit thickness perpendicular to the drawing, of Fig. 11-4 is

The active force Pa is a component of the weight vector as illustrated in Fig. 1 l-5c. Applying
the law of sines, we obtain

Pg = W
sin(p - 0) sin(180° - a - p + 0 + S)
Pa = Wsin(P-ct>)
sin(180° - a - p + ^ + S)
From Eq. (b) we see that the value of Pa depends on angle p; that is, all other terms for a
given problem are constant, and the value of Pa of primary interest is the largest possible
value. Combining Eqs. (a) and (b), we obtain
yH2 F sin(a+j3)l sin(p - cf>)

Passive earth pressure is derived similarly except that the inclination at the wall and the

Figure 11-1 displays that earth pressure is dependent on the effective stresses in the soil
and not total stresses. It necessarily follows that the wall pressure below the water table is the
sum of the hydrostatic pressure and the effective lateral earth pressure from using the effective
unit weight y' of the soil.

Example 11-1. What is the total active force per meter of wall for the soil-wall system, shown in
Fig. El 1-1, using the Coulomb equations? Where does Pa act?

Figure ElM

Solution. Take the wall friction 8 = 2<£/3 = 20° (a common estimate). For <p = 30° obtain Ka =
0.34 from Table 11-1:
pa = yzKa
Pa = f yzKadz= \yH2Ka
Pa = i(17.52)(5)2(0.34) = 74.5 kN/m
Summing moments about the top, we have
(H yH3
Pay' = yzKazdz = J-^-Ka
Jo 3
Using the symbolic Pa and equating, we obtain

y = 3 ^ № = 3H f r O m t O p ° r
ryir TJ
y = H — — = — from bottom (value usually used)

For 8 = 20° a force polygon would show that Pa will act on the wall as shown in Fig. El 1-1.

Example 11-2. What is the total active force/unit width of wall and what is the location of the
resultant for the system shown in Fig. Ell-la? Use the Coulomb equations and take a smooth wall
so 8 = 0°.


Solution. We have a surcharge, which is seen by the wall at z = O as a pressure q (which could be
caused by a fictitious soil depth of yzo)> There will be Ka values for each soil of
KaX = 0.307 Ka2 = 0.333 (Table 11-1 and a = 90°)
At z = 0 (top of wall where surcharge acts) we have
P\ = yzoKa = qKa = 100(0.307) = 30.7 kPa
At the interface (interpreted as z - dz) of top stratum z\ = 3.5 m and noting the surcharge q carries
through to give the effect of qz = yzo + JZ\, we have
p2 = (q + yZl)Ka = [100+ 16.5(3.5)]0.307
= 30.7+ 17.7 = 48.4 kPa
It is often convenient to retain the several effects separately. Here we see that q gives a rectangular
(constant) wall pressure whereas the increasing depth of soil gives a triangular pressure diagram
with 17.7 kPa at the base.
Continuing for soil 2, at depth z + dz = 3.5 m we are into soil 2 and since that is the location of
the water table we will have to use y' = 19.25-9.81 = 9.44 kN/m3.
Just at the interface we have
p'2 = [q + 16.5(3.5) + 9.44 dz]Ka2
= [100 + 16.5(3.5) + 0]0.333 = 52.5 kPa
Note we have an abrupt discontinuity in the pressure diagram of 48.4 kPa and at 3.5 + dx a pressure
of 52.5 kPa. At the bottom of the wall we have
p3 = [100 + 16.5(3.5) + 9.44(3.5)]^
which is the same as
p3 = 52.5 + 9.44(3.5)0.333
= 52.5 + 11.0 = 63.5 kPa (again the 11.0 is a triangle)

Figure Ell-2


The water also contributes lateral pressure and has Ka = Kp = 1 since <f)w = 0°. Thus,
Pw = ywzw = 9.807(3.5) = 34.3 kPa
These pressure values are plotted on Fig. El\-2b so the several pressure areas can be numerically
integrated to obtain the total wall force. By using triangles and rectangles as shown, the total wall
force is the sum from the several areas and the forces act through the centroids of the areas as shown
so that we can easily sum moments about the base to obtain

Include water with P4 since both areas are triangles:

Now sum the moments for y:

11-5 RANKINE EARTH PRESSURES
Rankine (ca. 1857) considered soil in a state of plastic equilibrium and used essentially the
same assumptions as Coulomb, except that he assumed no wall friction or soil cohesion. The
Rankine case is illustrated in Fig. 11-7 with a Mohr's construction for the general case shown
in Fig. 11-8. From Fig. 11-8 we can develop the Rankine active and passive pressure cases
by making substitution of the equation for r (shown on the figure) into the equations for EF
(and FG) (also shown on the figure). Then substitution into the expression for K'a (with OB
canceling and using sin2 /3 = 1— cos2 /3) gives the pressure ratio acting parallel to backfill
slope /3 as
R, = cos ^8 - JcOS

Since cos /3 is a permanent entry it is convenient to include it with K'a of Eq. (11-7) or K'p of
Eq. (11-8), giving, e.g.,
Ka = C Q S ^ - V c g g - C Q S ^ (n.7fl)
cos /3 + Vc o s 2 /3 ~~ cos2 cf)
and similarly for Kp. These latter values are given in Tables 11-3 and 11-4 to use in active
and passive pressure computations (use program FFACTOR for intermediate values). Using
these pressure ratios, one obtains the lateral pressure and force as follows:

which is applicable for cohesionless soils. Again note that the yz term represents effective
stresses. The horizontal and vertical components of Pa and Pp are usually required for design,
giving
Pa,h = Pacos P Pa>v = Pasin/3
PP,h = P P cos/3 PPtV = P p sin/3

Figure 11-9 Rankine active earth pressure diagrams in a cohesionless soil.
Example 11-3. What is the total active earth force per meter of wall for the wall system shown in
Example 11-1 using the Rankine equation?
Solution. For/3 = 10° and <^ = 30° we obtain Ka = 0.3495 from Table 11-3. Directly substituting
into Eq. (11-9), we may write
Pa = \yH2Ka = |(17.52)(5)2 0.350 = 76.6 kN/m
This value compares with 74.5 kN/m by the Coulomb equation, for a difference of about 2 percent,
but acts here at a wall angle of /3 = 8 = 10° as shown on Fig. El 1-3 instead of 3 = 20° of Fig.
El 1-1. The horizontal and vertical force components are

11-6 GENERAL COMMENTS ABOUT BOTH METHODS
One should not use the Rankine method for Kp when /3 > 0, since an inspection of Table
11-4 shows that it decreases with increasing /3. This is clearly not correct—Ka does properly
increase. Note also that one can use a (-) /3 in the Rankine equations, but the computed
coefficients are those of (+) /3.

The Coulomb equations are valid for both (+) and (—) /3. That is, Kp increases with
increasing /3 and decreases with (—) )3 values.
SOIL WITH COHESION. Neither the Coulomb nor Rankine method explicitly incorporated
cohesion as an equation parameter in lateral earth pressure computations. Bell (1915) seems
to be the first person to publish a solution to this problem. Bell's equations are actually Eqs.
(2-54) and (2-55) and were directly obtained from Mohr's circle. With these equations for the
pressure the wall force is obtained as in Eqs. (11-9) for the cohesionless case by integrating
between limits over the depth increment dz. Modifications to these equations might include
using the Coulomb or Rankine K factors in lieu of the tangent factors.
Example 11-4. Draw the active earth pressure diagram for a unit width of wall for the conditions
shown in Fig. El 1-4«. Compare the several possible alternatives that are produced from this problem
(tension crack, how the diagram might be modified, and water in tension crack).
At top: z = 0
Pa = yzKa - 2c JYa = -2(10.5)(0.84) = -17.64 kPa

and

Note: This value of z is the depth of a potential tension crack, since (-) p = tension stresses
that the soil cannot carry. At base, the lateral pressure [from Eq. (2-55)] is
pa = 17.52(6.5)(0.704)-2(10.5)(0.84) = 62.53 kPa
The resultant force is found as 2 Fh = R- The location of the resultant may be found by summing
moments at the base or by inspection, depending on the complexity of the pressure diagram. The
tension zone ab is usually neglected for finding the magnitude and location of the resultant.

In this case the water-in-crack solution is between the two previous solutions, from which it appears

Example 11-5. Plot the active earth pressure diagram and compute the resultant R and its location
y for the wall system shown in Fig. El 1-5. This type of problem is often encountered in excavations
for large structures where there may be two or more basement levels. The soil parameters 4>, c may
be estimated or else be obtained from performing consolidated isotropically undrained (CIU) tests
on good-quality tube samples. The major approximation is defining the several strata by abrupt
discontinuities (using lines as shown to delineate layers). In most real situations the soil type grades
through a finite length from one to the next.

Solution. We should plot the soil and pressure profiles adjacent to each other as in Fig. El 1-5. The
Rankine equations for active earth pressure coefficients Ka will be used [use program FFACTOR
since these small (/> angles are not in Table 11-3, or use Eq. (H-Ia)].
For instance, for </> = 32°, use Table 11-3, obtain Ka = 0.307 and 70.307 = 0.554, etc.
Typical computations for Ap^ are as follows:

Depth, m Ap0, kPa
0 100 kPa (surcharge)
1.80 100+ 1.80(17.30) = 131.4 kPa
2.40 131.4 + 0.6(19.60 - 9.807) = 131.4 + 0.6(9.79)
= 137.02 kPa
5.15 137.02 + 2.75(9.89) = 164.22 etc.

It will be convenient to tabularize the computations as in Table El 1-5 following.
Notice that at the interface between two soils we use the interface pressure two times: first with
—dz and the upper K coefficients, and second with +dz and the K coefficients of the lower soil.
Note also that the 2c JWa term can be simplified for the second use.
To find the resultant we must divide the pressure profile into rectangles and triangles as shown
on Fig. El 1-5/?. The water pressure is included (Ka = Kp = Kw = 1) if the water cannot drain

through the wall or away by other means. Since the water contribution is significant, it is obvious
that drainage should be allowed if possible.
The tension zone ( - ) qh is a problem. Should it be included to reduce the wall force or neglected,
as it may pull away from the wall? A more conservative case is made if the tension zone is neglected,
which we will do here—so neglect tension zone.
There is much busywork with this type of problem—particularly to get the pressure profile—so
that a computer program such as B-25 should be used if possible.
Computations for finding the resultant are as follows:

1. Compute the force P1 for each geometric area (rectangle or triangle) and locate its resultant y
from the base as partially shown on Fig. E11-5&:

2. Sum the horizontal forces X Fy1 = R

11-7 ACTIVE AND PASSIVE EARTH PRESSURE USING
THEORY OF PLASTICITY
The Coulomb and Rankine passive earth pressure methods consistently overestimate the
passive pressure developed in field and model tests for $ much over 35°. This estimate may
or may not be conservative, depending on the need for the passive pressure value. Because
of the problem of overestimation, Caquot and Kerisel (1948) produced tables of earth pres-
sure based on nonplane-failure surfaces; later Janbu (1957) and then Shields and Toluany
(1973) proposed an approach to the earth pressure problem similar to the method of slices
used in slope-stability analyses. Sokolovski (1960) presented a finite-difference solution
using a highly mathematical method. All these methods give smaller values for the passive
earth pressure coefficient. None of these methods significantly improves on the Coulomb or
Rankine active earth pressure coefficients.
Rosenfarb and Chen (1972) developed a closed-form earth pressure solution using plas-
ticity theory that can be used for both active and passive earth pressure computations. The
closed-form solution requires a computer program with an iteration routine, which is not
particularly difficult. This method is included here because of the greater clarity over the
alternative methods.
Rosenfarb and Chen considered several failure surfaces, and the combination of a so-called
log-sandwich mechanism gave results that compared most favorably with the Sokolovski
solution, which has been accepted as correct by many persons. Figure 11-10 illustrates the
passive log-sandwich mechanism. From this mechanism and appropriate consideration of its
velocity components the following equations are obtained.

In solving Eqs. (11-10) through (11-13), it is necessary to solve for the maximum value
of Kp or Ka. The maximizing of these equations depends on the two variables p and ifj.
This requires a search routine in computer program B-23. The values of the two dependent
variables are initialized to approximately
p = 0.5(a + j8)
(// = 0.2(a + /3)
With these initial values, the search routine is used to revise the values until convergence is
obtained. In most cases values from which Kp is computed are found after not more than 20
iterations. A computer program should shut off after 46 to 50 iterations. In a few cases the
program may not find a solution using the above initial values because of the programming
search routine. For these cases, one must change the initial values and retry as necessary to
obtain the solution. Table 11-5 gives selected values of Kp for cohesionless soils. Note that
these equations correctly give Kp increasing with /3. Values of /3 = 8 = 0 are not shown,
as they are identical to the Coulomb or Rankine solution.
The "smooth" wall solution is used for wall friction S < </>; when S = cf> the "rough"
wall equation is used. Equations (11-12) and (11-13) can readily be programmed, using the
same routines to solve an equation for minimum or maximum with two dependent variables,
to obtain passive pressure coefficients for cohesive soil. This solution does not give greatly
different values from the Coulomb passive pressure theory until the cf> angle becomes larger
than 35° and with 8 on the order of <f>/2 or more and /3 ^ 0° (since the back slope can have
±/3).
11-8 EARTH PRESSURE ON WALLS, SOIL-TENSION
EFFECTS, RUPTURE ZONE
The Rankine or Coulomb earth pressure equations can be used to obtain the force and its
approximate point of application acting on the wall for design. Soil-tension concepts can also
be investigated. These will be taken up in the following discussion.

11-8.1 Earth Forces on Walls
From Eq. (2-55) and temporarily considering a soil with c = 0, y constant with depth z and
referring to Fig. 11-9«, we can compute the wall force as
(H rH <V72K <vH2
Pa = *3Ka dz = yzKa = ^ p £ = ^-Ka (a)
Jo Jo 2 z
from which it is evident that the soil pressure diagram is hydrostatic (linearly increases with
depth) as shown in the figure. If there is a surcharge q on the backfill as shown in Fig. 11 -9c
(other surcharges will be considered in Sec. 11-13), the wall force can be computed as

The point of application requires taking moments about a convenient point, and for the
case with surcharge and from the top of the wall we have
Pay = J* (yz + q)KaZ dz = №f + ^Va (C)
and, inserting the value of Pa from Eq. (fo), the distance from the top of the wall is
1 IyH2 + 3qH
y t " 3 yH + 2q
and from the bottom of the wall y = H — yt
(for c = 0) (11-14)

(b)


Figure 11-11 Tension crack and critical depth of an unbraced excavation. Tension cracks are often readily visible adja-
cent to excavations.

When the surcharge q = 0, we obtain y = H/3; for c > 0 locate y using Example 11-4 or
Fig. 11-llc as a guide. It is not correct to convert the surcharge to an equivalent additional
wall height and use y to the centroid of a triangle, because the surcharge effect is rectang-
ular against the wall.
A number of researchers using both models and fairly large retaining walls have found that
the wall force resultant seldom acts at the distance y = H/3 from the wall base. This implies
that the wall pressure diagram is not triangular. Williams (1989, with a number of references)
derived equations that tend to produce a somewhat parabolic pressure distribution, which may
or may not coincide with the Coulomb pressure profile near the top.
In any case, the resultant of the lateral pressure is commonly taken as H/3 and the pressure
diagram is assumed to be triangular (if there is no surcharge), including cases where the
backfill slope angle /3 # 0. Some evidence exists that, because the wall rotates about its
base, the pressure diagram is not triangular and that the resultant is somewhere in the middle
one-third of the wall height—about the OAH point above the base.
Most walls are constructed with a void on the backfill side, which is then stage-filled
and compacted (that is, add a layer, compact it, add another layer, compact it, etc.) until the
surface is reached. This method also tends to increase the wall pressure—particularly near the
bottom—and more particularly for clay backfills (which may be necessary if granular backfill
is not available). The lower compacted soil produces lateral displacements in the upper wall
zone, so soil later compacted in this area may not produce enough additional deflection to
reduce the lower wall pressure to an active state.
Clayton et al. (1991) measured compaction pressures against a wall from a clay backfill.
They found that compaction pressures did not become significant until the air-void content
(difference between the zero-air-voids curve and the maximum dry density) was less than 15
percent and that the pressures could be expressed as a percentage of su, ranging from about
20 to 40 percent. Also they found that the lateral pressure, partially produced by compaction,
tended to reduce with time. The question is, what to do?

CHOOSE A K VALUE. Overdesign the wall by using a K intermediate between Ka and K0.

MAKE ASSUMPTIONS. Assume the computed soil pressure resultant is above the usual
point of application (the one-third point for no surcharge). If the pressure resultant (no

surcharge) is assumed to be at a point above the one-third point, the only way this can be
achieved is to force a trapezoidal pressure diagram into the model. This can substantially
increase the bending moments for structural walls, but the shear (and soil pressure resultant
R) remains the same, unless R is increased by some uncertainty factor, such as 1.1, 1.4, 1.5,
and so forth.
We can derive a general equation for locating the pressure resultant and the pressure at
the top of the wall necessary to define a trapezoidal pressure diagram. We already know
that the bottom pressure qb = ysH. From a trapezoid pressure diagram with qt and qb and
height H and the pressure resultant located at kH we can obtain two equations. The resultant
R = area of a trapezoid, giving
TJ JD
R = Hqt + (qb - qt)— -» qt + qb = — (a)
L Ll
Use Eq. (9-2) (the location of the center of a trapezoid) as the second equation and substituting
qt and qb for a and b, obtain

3 \qt + qb )
Now substitute Eq. {a) into Eq. (b) and simplify to obtain

q, = —Qk-I)I i 2
H \ valid from - < k <- (11-15)
qb = —(2 - 3*)J
For qbMt = 40 kPa, H = 10, compute R = 40 X 10/2 - 200. For k = \ we have
qt = 0; qb = qb,imt = 40. For k = 0.5 we have qt = qb = 20 {and the new R = [(20 +
20)/2](10) = 200 as before} but now y = 5 instead of y . Before computing the new top and
base pressures we may increase (or decrease) R as deemed necessary for the given wall.
One should adjust R with care—probably it is best to increase the earth pressure coeffi-
cient—since available evidence indicates the initial resultant Rinn is about that from the
Coulomb/Rankine equation but the location is not. Make the reduction as follows.
Although it is not unreasonable to put the location of the resultant above the one-third
point, one must decide what the minimum pressure will be that the wall must resist before
failure. A high pressure above the minimum active value may reduce to the minimum active
value as the wall starts to rotate forward under the higher pressure. This movement decreases
the pressure, but the wall may rotate further still under the reduced lateral pressure. The
wall either breaks or shears off or reaches some equilibrium resisting lateral pressure, and
movement stops.

11-8.2 Soil-Tension Effects on Backfill
and Open Trenches
Visible tension cracks usually develop where

1. Cohesive soil is used for backfill.
2. A trench or basement excavation is made in cohesive soil.


In the excavation case the cracks form parallel to the excavation and if under pavements
and structures can produce damage. We may use Eq. (2-55), slightly modified and repeated
here as
0-3 = (q + yz)Ka-2c/K~a (c)
where the quantity (q + yz) = <T\. Tension exists in a cohesive soil to some depth z = ht
until the stress <73 = 0 (after that the stress is compression). This depth is estimated from Eq.
(c) by rearranging, replacing z with ht9 and solving to obtain
^ = 2cjK-a-gKa ( 1 M 6 )
yKa
Note the inclusion of the surcharge q makes this equation general. The equation is most often
seen without the surcharge term as follows:

ht = 2Cr— (ll-16a)
yjKa
The tension crack can form at the wall-soil interface and/or at some distance back from the
wall (see Figs. 11-lltf, b). It is not unusual for several approximately parallel tension cracks
to form.
Another value of interest is the theoretical depth an excavation can stand without lateral
bracing. The key words here are the theoretical depth. Building codes and governmental
safety divisions (OSHA in the United States) usually give limitations on unbraced excavation
depths. In any case the theoretical value is computed by integrating Eq. (d) and using z =
Hc = theoretical or critical depth to obtain:
P = J CVq + yz)Ka-2cjKa\dz
Integrating (constant = O), inserting the limits, setting the horizontal force P = O, and sim-
plifying, we obtain

tic = J= ~ — (11-17)

There may be some question of what to use for Ka in Eqs. (11-16) and (11-17) when
/3 > O, since Eq. (2-55) as developed was for a horizontal ground surface. In the absence of
any better information use the Coulomb values from Table 11-3 with S = O .
One should not rely on the tension zone (see Fig. 11-1 Ic) to reduce lateral pressures. In-
stead one should assume that it can form and will possibly fill with water.1 The depth of water
(not the quantity) can increase the overturning pressure against the wall considerably owing
to both the hydrostatic force of ywht and the larger moment arm caused by combining the
hydrostatic force with the already existing lateral pressure.

1If the crack fills with water it will usually close with time as the soil swells. The soil-excavation system must,
however, survive during this time, so it is conservative to consider a crack filled with water as a worst case.


It is suggested that when there is a wall tension zone you use either of the two alternatives
of Fig. 11-1 Ic, together with the water pressure profile shown, if the tension crack can fill
with water. Treating the tension block as a surcharge is probably more nearly correct and
gives a more conservative (larger) wall force and overturning moment.
One cannot rely on Eq. (11-17) to predict the critical embankment height accurately for
several reasons:

1. Once the tension crack forms, Eq. (2-55) is not valid for the full depth of the excavation.
2. Cohesive soils tend to lose cohesion when exposed in excavations as a result of moisture
adsorption and/or shrinkage cracks.
3. A surcharge effect results from equipment and materials piled on the ground adjacent to
the excavation.

Because of these several factors, Eq. (11-17) should include a safety factor for design to obtain
a design depth H'c, as

Of course, if local authorities require a lesser value of H'c, that should be used.

11-8.3 Rupture Zone
The solution of the Rankine equations as shown by the Mohr's circle of Fig. 11-1« gives the
rupture slope p in the backfill as
<t>
p = 45 ± Tj- (+) = active pressure case
for horizontal (j8 = 0) ground. For the general case of sloping ground and/or wall friction
the p angle is not that given above. For these cases it is recommended to use the trial wedge
computer program B-7 on your diskette to obtain the critical p angle (so as to locate the
potential slip zone) since it is given as part of the output for hand checking. There are closed-
form solutions as in Jumikis (1962); however, they are complicated and subject to error in
either derivation or typesetting so that they should be used very cautiously if at all.

11-9 RELIABILITY OF LATERAL EARTH PRESSURES
Several sets of wall tests have been performed to check the validity of the Coulomb and Rank-
ine active and passive earth pressure methods. These include the tests of Terzaghi (1934),
Peck and Ireland (1961), Rowe and Peaker (1965), Mackey and Kirk (1967), James and
Bransby (1970), Rehnman and Broms (1972), and Coyle et al. (1972). Field and model tests
[as by Fang and Ishibashi (1986)] tend to confirm the active earth pressure concept reason-
ably well if the backfill is carefully placed so that compaction effects do not create excessive
stresses and if the wall rotates and/or translates sufficiently to mobilize the maximum shear-
ing resistance in the soil. Often the top of the wall translates/rotates adequately while near the
stem base it does not so that the pressure near the base is larger than predicted by theory—
particularly if some compaction of the backfill has been done. Regardless, the total wall force
from numerically integrating the pressure profile is usually close to the theoretical "active"


value and the resultant is usually at or above the lower one-third point (often closer to 0.4 or
0.45/f).
The active zone rupture surface is also fairly close to that predicted by theory and close
to being a plane. The passive zone, however, often is not in close agreement and the rupture
surface is closer to being a spiral. This latter gives additional cause for suggesting the use of
Sec. 11-7 with computer program B-23 (or similar) for the passive earth pressure case.

11-10 SOIL PROPERTIES FOR LATERAL EARTH
PRESSURE COMPUTATIONS
It is evident from the use of the Mohr's circle as a starting point for earth pressure coefficients
that effective stresses together with any hydrostatic water pressure are used to compute the
wall force. The usual condition of soil behind walls is as shown in Fig. 11-12. We have
excavated a vertical or sloping space for the wall, poured the wall footing and wall and then
backfilled the zone previously excavated, usually with some compaction. We then have to
idealize the model somewhat to compute the earth force that the wall must resist.

11-10.1 Soil Parameters
These soil parameters are used in computing lateral earth pressure:

1. Drained values for sand are used for reasons cited in Chap. 2. Ideally, plane strain <j>

is estimated from visual examination of the sand and using a conservative value from 30
to 34°.
2. For cohesive soils su values are commonly used and are generally adequate for normally
and lightly overconsolidated soil.
3. For overconsolidated soil we may use these:
a. A drained strength parameter with <f>' obtained from a drained shear test, using Fig.
2-25 as a test guide (not often), or estimated from one of the correlations given on Figs.
2-35 or 2-36.
b. The undrained shear strength at the creep threshold.
c. A drained <f> angle between peak and residual strength.

In cohesive soil a wall designed using almost any set of reasonable design strength param-
eters is likely to have an adequate risk factor if the following conditions are met:

1. Wall excavation did not cave during wall construction.
2. Excavated zone is backfilled and compacted using a freely draining soil.
3. If backfill is cohesive, increase the k-iactor of Eq. (11-15) to 0.40 to 0.50.

The risk factor is likely adequate even if the excavation/backfill zone is fairly limited since
a cave-in would have occurred if the retained soil were inherently unstable.

11-10.2 Water in Backfill
Water in the backfill soil is particularly undesirable since it increases the unit weight and
lateral pressure. If a water table can form (or stabilize), the effect is considerably worse since
the <f) angle of water is zero, giving Ka = Kp = 1 as used earlier. A further undesirable
side effect in cold climates is that the backfill water may freeze and greatly increase the
lateral pressure, causing the wall to displace forward. This displacement is usually not fully
recovered when thawing occurs.
Most of the water problem can be avoided by constructing drain (or weep) holes
through the wall base or using lateral drain pipes. The major problem here is to ensure
that the backfill does not erode through the weep holes or clog the lateral drain pipes. If
sand is used it should be properly graded, with coarse material adjacent to the drainage
device and finer material over the coarse. Currently a more reliable method is to face the
backfill side of the wall with a geotextile especially fabricated to allow vertical drainage.
The backfill adjacent to the geotextile does not have to be carefully graded for the geotex-
tile prevents soil erosion. It can be placed vertically and draped over the lateral drains to
avoid clogging. This material will allow the use of either granular (always preferable) or
cohesive backfill.
Although a geotextile material is ideal for allowing backfill drainage it is initially more
costly and requires care in placing and backfilling. Offsetting the higher initial cost is the
savings accrued from reduced maintenance, i.e., regular inspections and recovering eroded
material (refer to Fig 12-18Z?) from the weep hole exits and putting it back behind the wall
(often in vertical "pipes" formed by erosion down to the weep holes).


11-10.3 Angle of Wall Friction S
Wall friction apparently depends not only on the soil properties but also on the amount and
direction of wall movement [see Sherif et al. (1982)]. Indications are that maximum wall
friction may not occur simultaneously with maximum shearing resistance along the rupture
surface and that wall friction is not a constant along the wall—probably because the relative
soil-wall movement is not constant.
Considerable engineering judgment must be applied to obtain realistic values of wall fric-
tion since they are pressure-dependent. Values of S = 0.6 to 0.8$ are reasonable for concrete
walls where forms are used giving a relatively smooth backface. Table 11-6 gives several val-
ues of S for other wall-to-soil materials. For steel, concrete, and wood the values shown are
for a normal pressure an of about 100 kPa. Decrease the values about 2 degrees for each 100
kPa increase in sand [see Acar et al. (1982) and Fig. 2-31].
Rankine earth pressure is commonly used for the structural design of low- and medium-
height walls, since a larger wall pressure is obtained from not including any wall friction
angle 5. For high walls (say more than about 6 m) one should consider using the Coulomb

earth pressure (with some estimated wall friction angle 5), as the Rankine pressure is likely
to produce too much wall overdesign.

11-10.4 Wall Adhesion
Wall adhesion develops from any cohesion in the soil. In the upper region it is expected a
tension crack may form (or form during dry periods as the ground naturally shrinks). The
value of adhesion ca below the tension crack is usually taken at from 0.5 to OJs11 with a
maximum value not much over 50 kPa. There is some opinion to neglect the tension zones
along a wall (see Examples 11-4 and 11-5). One may need to investigate both the total stress
case [with cohesion (su)] and the drained (effective) stress case using only </>', depending on
the particular problem parameters.

11-11 EARTH-PRESSURE THEORIES IN RETAINING
WALL PROBLEMS
Both the Rankine and Coulomb methods are widely used to compute the lateral earth pressure
on retaining walls. The Rankine solution is often used because the equations are simple and
are somewhat more conservative than the Coulomb equations, that is, they compute a larger
lateral pressure.
The Rankine (and Coulomb) equation for cohesionless soil and no surcharge has the same
form as for hydrostatic problems, that is,
Pa = ycr* = j(yHKa)
where the yKa term is the equivalent unit weight of some fluid. Values in the range of 5 to
8 kN/m3 are given in some handbooks, and when these values are used, the resulting design
is termed the equivalent fluid method. This procedure is not generally recommended, partly
because one can simply select some value and not really analyze the problem.
In using either the Rankine or Coulomb solutions, no part of the wall should interfere
with the formation of the approximate rupture surface (line BC of Fig. 11-2). Generally for
cantilever retaining walls (walls with a heel projection as in Fig. 11-13Z?) one must make two
solutions:

1. At the back face of the wall using H = AB of Fig. 11-136 so the stem can be designed to
resist shear and moment.
2. At the heel point C using H = A1C for overall wall sliding and overturning stability.
11-11.1 Walls with Limited Backfill Zones
A major consideration in wall design is whether the idealized rupture zone can form as il-
lustrated in Fig. 11-12. In Fig. 11-12« the backfill zone is large enough that the "Rankine"
zone can develop in soil of known properties. In Fig. 11-12Z? the backfill zone is limited and
the Rankine zone (if one develops) will be in the original ground—the granular backfill only
provides free drainage so hydrostatic water pressure does not form. Obviously, if the existing
ground has been standing for some time it will contribute little—if any—lateral pressure to
the wall and the principal wall pressure will be from compacting the backfill in the limited
zone; however, lateral pressure from compaction may be substantial and even exceed any
computed active pressure.

tations.

The actual wall pressure in this case depends on wall rigidity (in terms of displacement)
and compaction effort. Usually compaction-induced wall pressures produce a resultant wall
force close to midheight versus the one-third height for the active pressure case. This problem
was discussed in Sec. 11-8.1, where it was given that one may use a lateral earth pressure
coefficient
Ka < K < K0
and either locate the resultant at the one-third point or use Eq. (11-15) to locate the resultant
higher along the wall.
Figure W-YIb represents a common field situation where considerable engineering judg-
ment is required to estimate the wall pressures. Considerable opinion holds that, when the b
dimension shown on the figure is so narrow that the Rankine wedge does not form, some kind
of arching action occurs. Handy (1985) considered arching in some detail and later Frydman
and Keissar (1987) suggested that one might estimate the lateral pressure using a modification
ofEq. (11-24) of Sec. 11-16 to read
^ = 2^[1 -e X p ( "2 ^t a n S ] (1M8)
where y = unit weight of backfill
b = backfill zone width


tan S = coefficient of friction
z = depth from top to where the lateral pressure ah is computed
K = lateral pressure coefficient

The value of K is critical—some use K = Ka, others use K = K0, and still others use some
intermediate value. It would appear reasonable to use Ka if the wall can rotate and K0 if the
wall is rigid. Frydman and Keissar (1987) also give an equation for estimating K that depends
on 4> and S as follows:
(sin2 (f> + 1) - V(sin2 </> + I)2 - (1 - sin2 </>)(4tan2 S - sin2 </> + 1)
/£ = - (11-19)
(4 tan2 S -sin2</>+ 1)
For c/> = 32° and S = 18° one obtains K = 0.329. The Rankine Ka = 0.307 but it has no
provision for including the wall friction angle S. This equation is somewhat sensitive to 5, so
one should exercise care to try to estimate a "best" value. Equation (11-19) is programmed
into program FFACTOR as option 8 on your program diskette.
Figure W-YId presents a method where granular backfill is limited in availability, so some
is placed to locate the "Rankine" zone adequately and then poor material is used in the region
where it is not critical. The limited back face zone is for drainage and could be eliminated by
using a vertical drainage geotextile against the wall. Here one would use the $ angle of the
granular soil but a unit weight that is an average for the backfill. Since this backfill geometry
requires careful field control, its use is a last resort.

11-11.2 Sloping and Irregular Backfill Surface
When the backfill is smooth or even, it may either be horizontal or have a ±/3 angle as
illustrated in Fig. 11-13. The Rankine equations see only a (+) /3 angle, but the Coulomb
equations recognize the /3 angle and its sign.
Additionally we may have a sloping dredge line (of Fig. 11-2). We would intuitively expect
a (+) slope to increase the wall pressure and a ( - ) to decrease the pressure. This expectation
is reflected in the Coulomb and Theory of Elasticity methods for both (+) and ( - ) /3 values
and in the Rankine method for (+) values. The ( - ) values have particular value for walls
using passive pressure in the soil below the dredge line. Occasionally walls supporting coal
piles and the like may have a negative slope as the stored material is depleted.
Where the ground is irregular, we may estimate the exit of the Rankine zone (line AC of
Fig. 11-7) and in region BC treat the irregular surface as either a best-fit slope or as a uniform
surcharge and use the equations for the case; for example in Fig. ll-14a we might smooth
out the irregular slope B'FE, measure the resulting /3 angle, and use either the Rankine or
Coulomb equation to obtain a lateral pressure coefficient.
Alternatively, we may also use the trial wedge method in Sec. 11-11.3, particularly if we
want a better estimate of the location of the rupture line.

11-11.3 Surcharges on Backfill
Surcharges such as point, line, strip, or finite area loads may be on the backfill and increase
the lateral pressure. Neither the Coulomb nor the Rankine equations have provision for these
types of surcharges. The graphical and computer methods of the next section and the Theory
of Elasticity method of Sec. 11-13 are often used to obtain lateral earth pressures for backfill
loads.


Figure 11-14 The trial wedge active force solution. For passive force slope of Pp is shown; slope R changes, Cs, Cw
reverse directions.

From the several solutions by these methods shown in Table 11-7 (Sec. 11-13), it is sug-
gested that the Rankine or Coulomb solution may be better than the graphical methods for
surcharges located within the Rankine wedge defined by the angle p (Slope of AC shown on
Fig. U-Ia).
If the surcharge is located within this zone, simply convert the surcharge to a vertical
load, divide by the distance BC (see also the figure on Table 11-7), and treat the result as a
surcharge q.
If the surcharge lies outside the distance BC the best solution is generally the Coulomb or
Rankine method plus the contribution from using the Theory of Elasticity of Sec. 11-13.
A special case of backfill surcharge is one located a distance d from the back face of the
wall. Motta (1994) has produced a closed-form solution but the equations are difficult. They
have been programmed in subroutine MOTTAKA in program FFACTOR as option 9; data
are input using screen prompts. All the values in MOTTAKA have been previously used (i.e.,
consistent notation).

11-12 GRAPHICAL AND COMPUTER SOLUTIONS
FOR LATERAL EARTH PRESSURE
There are graphical solutions for estimating lateral forces when the backfill is irregular-
shaped or loads are concentrated. Neither of these cases is consistent with the Rankine or
Coulomb theories. Among the several solutions are Culmann's (ca. 1886), the trial wedge
method (ca. 1877), and the logarithmic spiral.
An analytical solution based on the Theory of Elasticity can also be used. This is particu-
larly suited for computer use.
The Culmann and trial wedge methods are very similar except for the general orienta-
tion of the force polygons. Both methods rely on computing the known forces on a trial
wedge, which include any external load on the backfill, the weight of the trial wedge, and the
shear force on the tentative (or trial) rupture surface, and, from known slopes of the unknown
wall force vector Pa (or Pp) and the unknown resultant force R on the rupture surface, plotting

a force polygon and graphically obtaining the wall force Pa or Pp. The log spiral method is
similar but uses a log spiral segment to define the rupture surface, whereas the Culmann and
trial wedge methods use a plane surface.
Current analysis trends are to use a computer as much as practical, and for this reason
the only methods considered by the author are the trial wedge method (which can be pro-
grammed for an irregular-shaped backfill and any number of surcharge loads) and the Theory
of Elasticity method. For the interested reader the third edition of this book contains adequate
descriptions of both the Culmann and logarithmic spirals.
Computations using the trial wedge method can produce greatly different lateral pressures
from those resulting from the Theory of Elasticity (or Boussinesq) method. It is probable
that the trial wedge is overly conservative, whereas the Theory of Elasticity method may be
slightly unsafe. In any case we will look at the two procedures, recognizing that there will be
cases where one procedure may be preferable.

11-12.1 The Trial Wedge Method
As previously noted, the trial wedge and Culmann procedures are identical except for orien-
tation of the force polygon. The trial wedge also has an advantage over the Culmann solution
since one can have cohesion as a soil parameter. Figure 11-14 illustrates the general proce-
dure, which may be outlined as follows:

1. Draw the wall and ground surface to a scale that is as large as possible and compute the
depth of the tension crack as
h 2c

This value of ht is then plotted at sufficient points to establish the tension-crack profile
(dashed line BDxD1D of Fig. ll-14a).
2. Lay off trial wedges as AB'E\D\, AB9E1D1, ..., and compute the weight of the corre-
sponding wedges as w\, W1,..., wn. With a tension crack it may be preferable to compute
the weights as the sum of the tension block plus the weight of the triangle (as in Ex. 11-6).
3. Compute Cw and Cs (note that Cw is a constant) and lay off Cw as indicated in Fig. 11-14Z?
to the wall slope and to the appropriate force scale. As a tension crack can form along the
wall, the length AB (and not AB1) should be used to compute Cw. Also draw the weight
vectors Wi, W2, ..., Wn along the line OY. Note that the slopes are transferred from the
wedge to the force polygon.
4. From the terminus of Cw lay off Cs at the slope of the assumed trial failure wedges.
5. Through points w\, W1, ..., wn established in step 3, lay off a vector Pa to the correct
slope. Note that the slope of Pa (or Pp) is constant.
6. Through the terminus of Cs lay off the vector R to the appropriate slope. The slope is at
the angle 0 to a perpendicular to the assumed failure surfaces ADi, AD1, ADi,,
7. The intersection of the R and Pa vectors establishes a locus of points, through which a
smooth curve is drawn.
8. Draw a tangent to the curve obtained in step 7, parallel to the weight vector, and draw the
vector Pa through the point of tangency. As with the Culmann solution, several maximum
values may be obtained. The largest possible value of Pa is the design value.


The slope of the R vector (step 6 preceding) can be established conveniently (Fig. 11-14c)
as follows:

1. To some radius r draw the arc GJ from the vertical line AF in Fig. W-IAa.
2. Draw a horizontal line AO and lay off the angle $ as shown. With the same r used in step
1, draw arc OJ using A as the center.
3. Then AG is the slope of the vector R to failure plane AF.
4. Now lay off arcs GH, HI, IJ in Fig. 11-14c to the same arc length used in step 1.
5. The slopes of lines AH, AI, and AJ of Fig. 11-14c are the corresponding slopes of the
vector R to failure surface ADi, AD^,

In cohesionless materials the values Cw and C5 are zero, and the trial wedge solution is the
same as the Culmann solution except for the orientation of the force polygon.
There are a number of alternative methods of plotting the force polygon. These came about
because of the great difficulty in transferring the slope of the wedge line (AD, AD^, AD\ of
Fig. ll-14a) and the slope of the R vector. The slope of R can be obtained from the method
shown as Fig. ll-14c but must then be transferred to the force polygon of Fig. W-XAb. Accu-
rate slope transfer requires using as large a scale for the plots as possible and careful attention
to detail. If the force scale is too small or the slope transfer (usually using two triangles) in-
cludes any slip, the measured value of Pa (or Pp) can be in error by 10 to 20 percent or more.
For these reasons a computer program with sufficient output to reproduce the "failure" wedge
is much preferred.

Example 11-6. Solve the soil-wall system of Fig. El 1-6 using the trial wedge method.

Solution.

1. The problem is plotted to scale as shown with line AB drawn vertically through the heel of the
wall. Locate the ground surface and plot concentrated loads as shown. Also plot the tension crack
profile at depth zt = 1.5 m.
2. We will assume Pfl acts horizontally as shown (although a friction angle of 8 = </> might be a
better assumption for soil-to-soil on vertical face AB).
3. Compute adhesion on vertical face AB using an effective distance of

Z6 = H -ht = 6.1 - 1.5 = 4.6 m
Use full cohesion along ze for soil-to-soil.
4. Next lay off a trial wedge such as ABCI and compute weight. Also compute cohesion C5 =
distance AI X cohesion, etc.
5. Draw arc XY from A and similarly in the small inset (at same scale), and from AX of inset
lay off </> = 20° and then locate points 1 through 7 as shown. Al = slope of first R, Al =
slope of second R1 etc., which are directly transferred to the force polygon as extended lines
that are intersected by Pa from the W vector to complete the force polygon for any given trial
wedge.

11-12.2 Computer Solution of Trial Wedge
The simplest method of solving the trial wedge (or Culmann) method is to use a computer
solution, for which it is necessary to do the following:

1. Draw the wall-soil geometry to scale and obtain coordinates for sufficient points to plot
the ground profile and to locate any loads on the backfill. If a plotter is available and one
desires to plot the output, enough additional coordinates must be obtained and input to plot
the wall geometry.
2. Program a solution of the force triangle of Fig. 11-14b for P/. This involves two unknown
variables: the wall force P/ and the wedge resultant, labeled R, at the orientations (or
slopes) shown on Fig. 1 \-\4a. Since the force polygon must close and we know the slopes
of the unknown vectors, a direct analytical solution for P/ can be made.
3. Initialize the computations by using a starting soil wedge, say AFE\D\ with angle FAD\
of about 5° (depending on whether AF is vertical), and increment the wedge angle in 1°
increments. Solve the soil wedge twice at all point loads (dx to left and dx to right).
4. Sort the P/ values computed from steps 3 and 4 until all concentrated loads have been
accounted for and P/ has decreased at least two consecutive times. Stop the computations
and print out the maximum P/ and the corresponding p angle. This procedure allows for
study of parametric effects (</>, S, c, and y) much more easily than with the graphical
procedures previously discussed (and illustrated in Example 11-6).

Solution. Refer to Fig. El 1-6 for general geometry. Arbitrarily set the coordinates at the wall heel
(point A) at X = 1.68, Y = 0.0 m. There are two lines defining the backfill, so we give coordinates
at point B as X = 1.68, Y = 6.10 (consistent with coordinates at point A). At point C, X = 1.88,
Y = 7.10. Give coordinates at D a large value (X = 10.00, Y = 7.10). In a similar manner the
coordinates for the two loads can be obtained (see computer output sheet Fig. El 1-7 on next page).
The above dimensions allow us to develop the input data set (given on your diskette as
TWEDGE.DTA, which you can print for inspection). All of the input data are shown on the
output sheet but not in a format suitable for program execution. It is necessary to specify a tension
crack using parameter ITENCR = 1, otherwise the cohesion is not used. Also specify IHEEL = 1
to increment at 1° trial wedges. From the output we obtain Pa = 130.8 kN (versus 130 kN of hand
solution). It took 34 trials and p = 53.1° from the horizontal.

11-12.3 Point of Application of Wall Force Pa
The following procedure to find the point of application of the wall force Pa was suggested by
Terzaghi (1943). This procedure for case 1 (following) for a sloping or horizontal backfill with
no concentrated loads gives the point as H/3 as from the theoretical case. For the other cases
the user will have to decide if the procedure is valid. Note that case 3 is highly speculative
since it is questionable that a concentrated load outside the failure wedge contributes much
(if any) increase in Pa.

CASE 1. There are no concentrated loads (Fig. 11-15a), but there may be other surcharges.

a. Find the center of gravity of the failure wedge graphically or by trimming a cardboard
model and hanging it by a thread at two or three points.

The author suggests the best solution for total wall force and point of application when
there are backfill loads of any type and location is to use one of the following:

1. If the backfill load is inside the Rankine zone, convert it to an equivalent surcharge over
the Rankine zone, then obtain the wall pressure and resultant using either the Coulomb or
Rankine equations.
2. If the backfill load is either inside or outside the Rankine zone, use the Coulomb or Rank-
ine equations for the soil wedge with no backfill load. Next use the Theory of Elasticity
equations given in Sec. 11-13 to find the wall forces from the backfill loads. Then to find
total force and point of application use X P — R — X Pi and Ry = X Piyi-

11-13 LATERAL PRESSURES BY THEORY OF ELASTICITY
The Boussinesq Equation
The trial wedge method seems to be too conservative in estimating the lateral force against
a wall when there are surcharges (or loads) on the backfill—particularly outside the Rankine
zone. For this reason, at present this procedure does not seem to be used much. The Theory of
Elasticity method can be used to compute the lateral pressure profile against the wall from the
surface surcharge (point, line, strip) loading. The Boussinesq equation—or some variation of
it—is commonly used. The equation form usually credited to Boussinesq is

Equation (11-20) can also be written as
P \3rh 1 - 2 / x 1
ar = 2^ [^- - R(RT7)\ (U-2°a)
where the several terms including 0, z, r, and R are identified on Fig. 11-16. This form of the
equation is particularly suitable for programming on a small calculator, since the point load P
is usually fixed with given x, y coordinates and we want to vary z to obtain the wall pressure
profile.
The computer programming of this equation allows one to solve any of the given backfill
surcharge loads of Fig. 11-17 defined as follows:

1. Point load. Use the equation in the given form.
2. Line load. Treat as either one load or a series of concentrated loads along a line of unit
width acting on unit areas.
3. Strip load. Treat as a series of parallel line loads acting on strips of some unit width.
4. Loaded area. Treat as a series of parallel line loads acting on strips of finite length.

We can easily analyze a constant uniformly loaded area (say, the interior part of an em-
bankment) or one with a linear varying load (say, the embankment side slopes). In either of
these cases the loaded area is divided into strips with some load intensity q and some small
"unit" width B, on the order of 0.25 to 0.5 m. These strips are then subdivided into "unit"
areas of some length L also on the order of 0.25 to 0.50 m. These "unit" areas are treated as
a series of point loads of Q — qBL acting at the center of each of the unit areas. The several
"unit" area contributions making up the total loaded area are then summed to obtain the total
lateral pressure acting at some point at the depth of interest (either in the soil or on a wall).
This is the procedure used in program SMBLPl (B-8) on your program diskette.
The general validity of using a form of Eq. (11-20) for surcharges was established in sev-
eral publications, including the work of Spangler (1936), Spangler and Mickle (1956), Rehn-
man and Broms (1972), and others.

diskette. NSQW, NSQL = number of unit elements away from wall and parallel to wall, respectively, as used in
the computer program.

The early work of Spangler and Spangler and Mickle introduced an error into the general
application of the equations; however, that can be avoided by direct use of Eq. (11-20) and
an appropriate value for Poisson's ratio /JL.
When the work of Spangler was first published, he used /JL = 0.5 [and later in Span-
gler and Mickle (1956)], which substantially simplifies Eq. (11-20)—but may not be correct.
Spangler's work consisted of trying to measure the lateral pressure against a 1.829 m (2.134
m total height) high X 4.572 m wide retaining wall with a constant stem thickness of 0.150
m. He used metal ribbons (since earth-pressure cells were not readily available in the early
1930s) and simply dumped a granular (WL = 17.5, Wp = 13.2%) backfill behind the wall
with no compaction at all to produce an extremely loose state. After a time, he had a truck
backed onto the loose backfill so that the rear wheels could simulate two concentrated loads.
To simulate a line load he laid a railroad crosstie parallel to the wall, onto which the rear
wheels (a single axle with dual tires) of a loaded truck were backed. Since the wall was only
4.572 m long and a railroad crosstie is about 3 m long, a strip model was not very likely to
have been produced.
From these efforts Spangler (both references) found that the measured lateral pressure was
about twice that predicted by Eq. (11-20) with /JL = 0.5. From the reported results, Mindlin
(1936a), in discussing Spangler's (1936) work suggested that the factor of 2 could be ex-
plained by a rigid wall producing the effect of a mirror load placed symmetrically in front of
the wall (Fig. 11-ISa). The author began looking at this problem more closely and decided
that the mirror load is not an explanation. As shown in Fig. 11-18&, a mirror load on a rigid

wall would simply cancel the lateral shear stresses in the wall and certainly not double the
horizontal pressure. A flexible wall could possibly double the lateral pressure but would have
to be extremely flexible (and have the loads applied sequentially). Referring to Fig. 11-18Z?,
we see that the horizontal pressure ah produced by P0 (applied first) acting on a rigid area of
dydz would develop shear resistance r such that rt(2dz+2dy) = a^ When mirror load P0 is
applied, a second shear stress r would develop on the element but in the opposite direction, so
the shear stress would cancel and we would simply have on each side of the wall a horizontal
stress ah (not 2ah). If the wall is flexible and little shear stress develops, the element would
(if the loads were applied sequentially) displace laterally toward the -a direction to produce
a resisting soil stress on the —a side of a'h = ah — r(2dz + 2dy). Since this would become
locked in when P'o is applied, the stress on the left would become ah + a'h, and since a'h is
transmitted through the wall, the right side would also have the existing cr^+ transmitted a'h
value from load P0. If the loads were applied simultaneously the stresses would simply be
ah on each side (and not 2ah).
Mindlin got around this complication by inserting a statement that the wall was rigid but
could not carry shear. There is no such wall type known to the author.
Because the Spangler work was done in the early 1930s, it is difficult to speculate on
the cause of the high stresses except to note that the wall had rather finite dimensions. The
surcharge load was caused by a truck backing onto the backfill. When it stopped at the desired
position it would have produced an inertial force that was amplified because the fill was not
well compacted. The backfill probably was of limited extent, so that it is also possible some
type of arching occurred that increased the lateral pressure.
More recently Rehnman and Broms (1972) showed (using modern earth-pressure cells)
that when the soil behind the wall was dense the lateral pressure from point loads was much
less than when the soil was loose. They also found that gravelly backfill produced larger
lateral pressures than finer-grained materials. This observation indicates that both soil state
and Poisson's ratio are significant parameters.

Rigid wall

(b) Horizontal stress oh on differential
area dy dz.


Theory of elasticity gives the limiting range of Poisson's ratio as
- 1 < x t < 0.5
Also note that, strictly, there is a sign with /x, so that (+) means an elongation strain with
lateral contraction, as for a tensile steel test that gives LL = 0.3, and a compression strain with
lateral expansion, as for a concrete test cylinder giving /n ~ 0.15. No engineering material is
known that might give a ( - ) ratio where there is lateral expansion with elongation or lateral
contraction with compression.
In Chap. 2 it was stated that for soils, values of /x can be greater than 0.5 with values of
0.6 and 0.7 fairly common because soil is only pseudoelastic.
Equation (11-20) and similar expressions do not compute reliable wall pressures for sur-
charge loads (point, strip, or line) unless the loads are located beyond some critical distance
from the wall. Laba and Kennedy (1986) suggested this distance might be OAH. Terzaghi
(1954) had also suggested OAH might be the critical distance and provided two equations,
based on Eq. (2-20) but with LL = 0.5: one for the surcharge distance < OAH from the wall
and a second for the surcharge distance > OAH.
With this background, it is clear that approximations to using Eq. (11-20) should be used
cautiously. There are a number of closed-form solutions for select cases of backfill loads; how-
ever, the author has found substantial differences, particularly for variable intensity loading.
For these several reasons, and because Eq. (11-20) can be easily programmed for all the
cases, it is the only method recommended by the author. Comparison with closed-form solu-
tions indicates almost no error from using discrete methods for continuous loadings.
There is some misuse of Eq. (11-20) or its equivalent caused by setting LL = 0.5 so the
LL term disappears. For example, line and strip loads of infinite length should be treated as
plane strain problems. That is, take a unit length parallel to the wall similar to the procedure
for surcharges.
For both line and strip surcharges, Terzaghi (1943) performed integrations on the modified
Eq. (11-20) using ±oo for the limits—but stated that these loadings were plane strain prob-
lems. In using Eq. (11-20) one should be using a plane strain LL' [see Eq. (2-65)] instead of
the triaxial value (or a value estimated at around 0.3 to 0.4). Note the following short table
for the plane strain /x' versus triaxial /x:

[L = 0.3 0.33 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.60
[L' = 0.42 0.50 0.54 0.67 0.82 1.00 1.50

Table 11-7 illustrates the case of a small retaining wall with a concentrated load at varying
distance, using a range of Poisson's ratio. This wall also includes the trial wedge solution for
the several load positions and the Rankine lateral pressure computed for no surcharge. From
this table several conclusions can be drawn:

1. The trial wedge method gives the Coulomb (or Rankine if S = 0) wall force for a hori-
zontal backfill and correctly locates the failure surface using angle p measured from the
horizontal. For concentrated surcharges on the backfill, much larger wall forces are ob-
tained than by any other method.
2. Poisson's ratio/x = 1 gives a substantial increase in wall pressure versus LL = 0.3 to 0.5.
A plane strain LL' = 1.00 may be possible for soil in a very loose state.


3. Concentrated loads well outside the Rankine zone contribute to Pa in the trial wedge case,
leading one to the opinion that the trial wedge is not correct, but conservative.
4. Since Eq. (11-20) gives small lateral pressures when the load is very close to the wall, this
result may mean either that the surcharge load is being carried downward by vertical wall
friction rather than by lateral pressure or that Eq. (11-20) is not valid for a load close to
such a massive discontinuity in the elastic half-space.
5. Wall pressures computed by Eq. (11-20) are rather small once the wall-to-load distance is
greater than the Rankine zone.
Computer Program for Lateral Pressure
Computer program SMBLPl (B-8) on your program diskette can be used for all the lateral
pressure problems shown on Fig. 11-17. By superposition, almost any conceivable surcharge
load can be analyzed, quite rapidly in most cases.

Figure 11-19 General method used in computer program to obtain wall pressure profile, wall resultant R, and
point of application y. Variables used in computer program are shown to identify dimensions required for analysis.

The program is written to solve Eq. (11-20) for a uniform or strip load modeled as a series
of point loads located at the centroid of a small area. The area should be on the order of
0.3 X 0.3 m (1 X 1 ft) but does not have to be square (use 0.2 X 0.3, 0.3 X 0.4, etc.).
For a line load with the plane strain assumption, use a single point load perpendicular to
the wall location where the pressure profile is wanted and use /x/. For a strip use a unit width
opposite the wall, divided into as many unit areas as necessary to define the strip width, and
again use /i/. For a finite-loaded area divide the load into as many unit areas as necessary
and use /x (not ju/), but it can be > 0.5 based on your analysis of the soil state. The computer
program also allows one to input a factor such as 2.0,1.4,1.2,1.0, etc. to "adjust" the pressure
for close proximity to the wall.
Note that Fig. 11-16 shows the lateral stress as a radial value. The program, however, uses
the horizontal component, always assuming the distance to the load DTWAL is perpendicular
to the wall face. Refer to Fig. 11-19 for select program variable identification and the method
used to compute the wall force resultant and location y.
Program SMBLPl will be used to solve the following two examples. The first example
illustrates the effect of /JL on the lateral pressure and the second example examines the linear
varying load and how to check certain types of problems.
Examples 11-8 and 11-9 show that the lateral pressure is heavily dependent on Poisson's
ratio /x. Any lateral pressure equation that does not include Poisson's ratio has probably used
in = 0.50, which may not be a bad estimate if it is used as a plane strain value since it
corresponds to a triaxial type /JL of about ^.

Example 11-8. Find the lateral force against a 7.5 m wall from a 2 X 4 m loaded area that is 3 m
from the wall as in Fig. EIl-Sa.

NSQL

Input data:
NSQW = NSQL = 10 (probably could use NSQW = 5)
giving BI = 2/10 = 0.2 m and W\ = 0.4m
PSQR = 200(0.2 x 0.4) = 16 kN
DOP = 2m (shown) DTWAL = 3.0m (also shown)
DY = 0 (top of wall level with loaded area)
HTWALL = 7.5 m (given)—use NVERT = 1 1 ( 1 0 segments)
LIST = 0 (no additional output requested)
IVARI = 0 (constant q = 200 kPa)
IMET = 1 (SI units)

Use: \i = 0.30, 0.50, and 1.00 (XMU)

Solution. We will use /JL = 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0.
Since the center of the loaded area will cause the greatest possible wall pressure, we will center
the base on the wall point of interest.
From the sketch we see that the length is parallel to the wall, so we will use NSQW =
NSQL = 10, giving unit areas that are Bl = 0.2 m X Wl = 0.40 m. The equivalent concen-
trated load on this unit area is

200 kPa X 0.2 X 0.4 = 16 kN (input as PSQR since it is constant)

For the text we will restrict the listing to only the input data and the solution.
Using 11 points on the wall gives DDY = 7.5/(NVERT - 1) = 0.75 m, which is computed
in the program. With PSQR = constant, use IVARI = 0, DOP = 2 m since the wall is centered
and DTWAL = 3.0 m (given data). Building a data file, we obtain Fig. E11-8Z? as I/O. We see that
varying /JL from 0.3 to 1.00 nearly triples the wall force and from 0.5 to 1.0 nearly doubles the wall
force. Of interest in the next example is the wall force for fi = 0.50 for resultant R = 52.672 kN
shown on Fig. E11-8Z?.

Wall

Example 11-9. For the linear loaded area shown in Fig. Ell-9a compute the wall force.

Solution. Since the general data are identical to Example 11-8 the only additional input is to use
IVARI = 1 and then input a series of element loads PSQL(I) for the 10 strips parallel to the wall.
The strip element loads are computed as shown on Fig. Ell-9a and are output with the other input
data on Fig. El 1-%.
Comments. This problem is self-checking by solving the problem with the load linearly increasing
and then linearly decreasing [which simply reverses the order of PSQL(I)]. The sum of the two
solutions should equal the 52.672 kN of Example 11-8.
Here the sum is
23.898 + 28.774 = 52.672 kN (vs. 52.672 previous)

From the check it would appear that the program is correct and that the sloping surcharge has been

Comment. The lateral pressure problem has a number of solutions in the literature for linearly vary-
ing surcharges but the author has found the only consistent answers are from the computer program.

One can model a strip or line load, as previously stated, but the model is probably not
correct since these types of loadings are properly plane strain cases. If one elects to use the
infinite strip one can model it using a finite number of unit areas—say, about 40 or 50 de-
pending on the distance from the wall. Also use one-half the length and double the computed
force or pressures. One can determine whether there are enough unit areas by making two


runs with, say, 40 areas in one and 50 in the other, and seeing whether there is any significant
change in the computed wall force resultant.

11-14 OTHER CAUSES OF LATERAL PRESSURE
Ice Formation
Lateral pressures can be developed when pore water in the backfill freezes. This problem is
minor in an unsaturated soil unless ice lenses form. The problem can be eliminated by using
granular backfill and/or providing a drainage system, as illustrated in Fig. 11-12, of drain (or
weep) holes and longitudinal collector drains with or without a vertical geotextile drain.
Swelling Pressure
If the retaining wall backfill is an expansive clay whose water content increases beyond that
at the time of placement, it can expand and produce very large lateral wall pressures. The
problem can be somewhat alleviated by placing the clay under carefully controlled conditions
of no lumps and at a water content considerably above optimum (> OMC). The problem can
be considerably alleviated by using granular backfill; however, this is not always possible.
Lateral pressure is not likely to be developed when one is building against overconsolidated
clay, for the high initial K0 stresses will be lost as soon as the excavation is opened. Vertical
rather than lateral expansion is more likely to be a problem in overconsolidated clay.
Thrust Due to Temperature
Walls providing restraint to members that can undergo thermal expansion and contraction
may develop unwanted stresses. This problem can be solved by minimizing the restraint with
rollers, hinges, or expansion joints. Typically this type of action occurs in bridge abutments
and such.
Lateral Pressure Due to Compaction
A number of studies have been made in an effort to estimate the lateral wall pressure due
to compaction of the backfill. Not much success has been had except to ascertain that com-
paction does generally increase the wall pressure. The problems are these:

1. Width of backfill zone
2. Type of backfill
3. Type—weight and method—of compaction equipment used

Because of these several variables designers have the options of ignoring compaction pres-
sures or raising the pressure resultant location from about ///3 to 0.4 or 0.5//. Those who
ignore the compaction pressure assume the wall, being somewhat flexible, will rotate suffi-
ciently to produce active pressure conditions regardless of the initial pressures.

11-15 LATERAL WALL PRESSURE FROM EARTHQUAKES
Field observations and model studies indicate that earthquake and machinery vibrations will
increase the wall pressure/force. The earthquake acceleration a produces an inertial force in
the active, passive, and wall masses (see Fig. 11-20) according to
F = ma (a)


(b) Saturated backfill case

where m = W/g = mass of soil or wall
a = some fraction of the acceleration of gravity g (such as 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc.)

From this we obtain from Eq. (a)

Fh = mah = ^-(kh Xg) = yikh (b)

Fv = *«,(?<* or y') (c)

as shown on Fig. 11-20.
We can define the angle of the earthquake resultant (see Fig. 11-20, which includes both the
net gravity force of the soil wedge and the lateral earthquake force) as an angle 8 defined as

water

(a) Dry soil case

Inertia force


for a dry soil using the substitution of values shown on Fig. 11-2Oa. For a submerged soil
there are two cases to consider (see Fig. 11-20&).
Case I. The soil is saturated but relatively impervious, so that the water essentially
moves with the soil giving Ff1 = khj^u however, the vertical component is always the sub-
merged y' = ysat - Jw With suitable manipulations using methods and soil definitions given
in Sec. 2-3, we obtain
t a n - 1 ^ ^ = ^
which can be transformed to a new value, say 0', of
0' = 9±±ltm-l0 = Me tan'1 6
Gs - 1
In this case with a soil of low permeability (clays, silts, and very fine sand) the 6 angle to be
used is about twice as large as for a dry soil.
Case II. For soils with large permeability such as coarse sands and gravels we use the
alternative form shown on Fig. 11-20& to obtain
tan-i, = ^ = ^ ! ^
Fv J' ± kvy'
which can be transformed into a new value, say 0", of
0" = - ^ - t a n " 1 0 = Me tan"1 0
Gs - 1
In the case of a soil with Gs = 2.65 and a high permeability (coarse sands, etc.) the 0-angle
to be used is about 1.6 times as large as a dry soil.
The foregoing values for the angle 6 can be used in the Mononobe-Okabe equations for
the dynamic active and passive earth pressure coefficients Kae, Kpe—if you use program
FFACTOR you will be asked if you want to input one of the forms of the multiplier Me given
above.
The Mononobe-Okabe equations were developed in Japan ca. 1926 (and the original ref-
erence is probably no longer available2). Referring to Fig. \l-21a, we see that a passive zone
may assist in resisting wall movement. The active and passive forces at an angle of S normal
to the wall face can be computed in general (including dynamic water pressure Pwd) using
( M - 1(1± Jy' + - ^ ^ ] HA M + Pwd+ Pw (11-21)
[Ppej 2 \ sin(a + j3)/ [Kpe]
This equation requires some discussion:

1. The (1 ± kv) term depends on the sign of kv and not on Pae or Ppe.

2The most readily available reference is probably Matsuzawa et al. (1985). Almost all the equations found in several
reference sources include one or more errors. The equations as programmed in program FFACTOR give values
that are similar to those from several graphs found in the literature.


2. For the Mononobe-Okabe earthquake coefficients, use subscript a for the active Kae and
p for Kpe. The dynamic water pressure term Pwa* is generally that given by Westergaard
(1933, closure p. 472) for a large body of free water,
Pwd = 0.5837^Tf2 (kN/m or kips/ft of wall)
This equation for Pwd (at y = OAH) is not applicable if the pore water is not free to
move. When the permeability is low the dynamic water force will have to be estimated in
some other manner, or simply use ysat in the appropriate equation for 0 above and neglect
the Pwd term.
Use Pwd only on the backfill side of the wall.
3. The surcharge term qs was added by Matsuzawa et al. (1985).
4. The static water force Pw term is optionally used for the passive side of the wall when
there is water on both sides of the wall. It may be used on the backfill side if you do not
use Pwd, but do not use it on both sides at the same time.
5. The original equations were for a dry sand backfill with the resultant at H/3 above the
base. Current opinion, based on laboratory shaking table experiments [see Sherif et al.
(1982)], is to put the resultant y at between 0.45 and 0.63ZJ. Whitman (1990) suggests
using y = 0.6//. For an equivalent trapezoidal pressure profile use the resultant earth
force and its y location; refer to Eq. (11-15).
6. If you have a stratified backfill (as for anchored sheet piling of Chap. 13) along a wa-
terfront you should use averaged soil properties for the full length of the piling for H—
not the height above the dredge line—with the resultant force placed at 0.6// above the
pile tip.
7. The dynamic p, defining the failure wedges (of Fig. 11-2Ia) is not the Rankine value of
45° ± 0/2. If Kae < 1 you might obtain a pa of 45° - </>'/2, where you find a pseudo
cf)' by trial using the Coulomb equation in FFACTOR and smaller <f> angles until the
value of Ka computed is approximately that of Kae. Note that pi = 0 if Kae > 1 or if
Kp6 ^ 1.
Davies et al. (1986) suggest the p angle for dry soil has an approximate parabolic vari-
ation from the static case (kh = 0) to zero as kh —> 0.6. The value of kh producing p = 0
is termed the critical acceleration and is approximately
kh = (1 ± A:y)tan0

The following Mononobe-Okabe dynamic earth pressure coefficients are not exactly as
given in Mononobe-Okabe but have been modified to be similar to the Coulomb equations
and to use the Coulomb definition of wall angle af.

with terms as previously used and as illustrated on Fig. 11-21 and with subscript / =
a or p. Owing to the difficulties of typesetting and using this equation, it is in program
FFACTOR as option 7 on your program diskette. Carefully note that the foregoing

equations with (+) signs as shown

coefficients include both the static and earthquake-induced earth pressure at an angle of ±8
to the normal vector to the wall The sign with S depends on the direction of relative earth-to-
wall movement and is influenced by the sign of any assumed kv. This relationship is shown
to be true from the use of the weight vector resultant defined by the 0 angle shown on Fig.
\l-2la. Note that if you use kh = 0 you get the Coulomb values of Tables 11-1 and 11-2.
When the V^-term of Eq. (11-22) is (-) it should be set to 0 [as is done in program
FFACTOR—output ROOTl or ROOT2 = (-)]. It is often negative when using the 0 mul-
tiplier Meofd' or 0" previously given.
The horizontal earth force is usually required; however, this should be a trivial exercise if
you draw the system to a reasonable scale (see Fig. ll-21fc) showing the wall angles at and
earth-pressure vectors Pae, Ppe at the correct S against the wall.
Whitman (1990) suggests that one might approximate Kae as
Kae = Ka+ 0.15kh
If you compute Kae using Eq. (11-22), you might check whether the value Kae(l ± kv) is in
the range Whitman suggested to avoid any large error in Kae. The value of Ka is the Coulomb
value from Table 11-1. The following short tabulation lists several values of Ka, Kp, and Kae,
Kpe as well as the Whitman (1990) approximation:

kh = 0 . 3 0 ; kv = 0

•Using the Whitman (1990) approximation of Ka + 0J5kh.
tIfweuseMe = 2.65/(1 +0.6) = 1.66 we obtain Kae = 2.149; Kpe = 7.948.

(b) General wall forces for dry backfill

Figure 11-21
The table shows that the dynamic active earth pressure Kae is considerably larger than the
Coulomb value of Ka and the dynamic passive earth pressure Kpe is substantially smaller
than the Coulomb Kp. These observations should not be unexpected. The Whitman (1990)
suggestion does not appear to be valid—possibly because kh = 0.3 may be too large and in
any case should only be used for the dry soil case.
Some problems associated with using the Mononobe-Okabe equation include the follow-
ing:

1. Identification of kh and kv. Often kv will be zero (no vertical acceleration—or very small).
Note kv has a sign as shown on Fig. 11-20 and, depending on direction, can either increase
or decrease the vertical (gravity) force Fv. In most cases kv can be neglected; however,
both the 1994 Northridge (California) and the 1995 Kobe (Japan) earthquakes had upward
vertical components, with the result that the upward acceleration increased the downward
gravity force by the inertial force, causing the ground floor of a number of multistory
structures to be squashed.
2. What to use for wall friction 8. Seed and Whitman (1970) suggested S « <f>/2 and Mat-
suzawa et al. (1985) suggested S « 20/3.
3. What soil parameters to use for stratified soils in both the active and passive zones.

Since one must estimate the earthquake fraction (a = kh or kv X g) it is obvious a
solution that is about as reliable as any would be to use the Rankine equations together
with perhaps an additional horizontal force of from 0.2 to 0.4WR, where WR — weight of
the Rankine wedge + any surcharge and any other soil that might push against the wall

11-16 PRESSURES IN SILOS, GRAIN ELEVATORS, AND
COAL BUNKERS
Lateral pressure of agricultural products against the walls of grain storage containers (typi-
cally as in Fig. 11-22«) is similar to lateral earth-pressure problems earlier in this chapter. It is
necessary to obtain the internal and wall friction angles of the material. The 4> values depend
on the material being contained, its water content, and its density. Wall friction S depends
on the wall material used and the factors cited earlier for soil. Table 11-8 gives representa-
tive values for several agricultural grains for which containment structures may be required.
Grain is often measured in terms of bushels; a bushel is approximately 0.0352 m3 (1.24 ft3).
The grain (or other stored material) pressure for relatively shallow containment structures,
say, under about 7 m in height, and with a height/width ratio < 2 (see also Fig. 1 l-22c), can be
computed using the Rankine or Coulomb earth-pressure equation with /3 = angle of repose
of material (</> is also often taken as the angle of repose). The Rankine solution will tend to
be somewhat more conservative than the Coulomb method since wall friction angle S = O
in the Rankine case.

Use plane strain <f> for long rectangular bunkers and triaxial <£ values for square and round
storage shapes.
Coal bunkers often have sloping hopper bottoms as in Fig. 1 l-22c, which require obtaining
the normal and tangential components of pressure on their slopes. These values can be ob-
tained from the geometry of the problem and an ellipse of stress analysis [see Rogers (1952)]
to obtain (in units of zy of kPa or ksf)
Tangential stress: pt = z(y - yKa) sin a cos a 1
9 9 1 (1*~^/
Normal stress: pn = yzcos <f) + yzKa sin </> J
where terms are as defined on Fig. \l-22c or previously used and Ka is either the Rankine or
Coulomb (or at-rest) lateral pressure coefficient.
Grain elevators, silos, and deep storage bunkers (for coal, cement, lime, etc.) are deep bins
and require a modified analysis for the lateral and vertical wall pressure for design. When
grain elevators (Fig. 11 -22a) are emptied, dynamic pressures can develop that have caused
walls to split. These overpressures are caused by the funneling action of the falling material
which produces a lateral wall-bursting pressure similar to flowing water in a tapered conduit.
Currently there is no precise method of evaluating these forces, since the material drop speed
and taper diameter vary from the upper region to the exit point.
There is opinion that in the transition zone of Fig. 11-23Z? the lateral wall pressure transi-
tions from an active case to a passive pressure case at the hopper (or other exit level). If this
situation occurs, it would certainly produce some very large pressures since Kp is substan-
tially larger than Ka. Passive pressure formation is not illogical since the flow of Fig. 11-23a

and b essentially represents a plug of material flowing downward in the "pipe" formed by the
nonflowing material. From this concept, it follows that the minimum overpressure is likely to
occur if the draw-off orifice is centered in the middle third of the bin and would be a maximum
when it is located to one side.
The pressures generated by storage of granular materials in deep containment structures
such as silos, bins, etc. are generally determined by either the Janssen or Reimbert method.
The procedure currently recommended by ACI 313 (1991) suggests these two methods
for the static pressure analysis and overpressure factors for dynamically dumping material
into the bin or for outflow based on estimates of ratio of dumped material to bin size or for
the height/diameter ratio for outflow.
The Janssen method [Briassoulis (1991), Safarian (1969), ACI (1977)] computes the
static pressures at any depth z measured from the centroid of zo (see the right side of Fig.
11-23c) as

Vertical pressure: po = — 1 - exp(-AT^ • — • tan§) (11-24)

Lateral pressure: Ph = poKa (11-25)
The total vertical force on a unit strip of wall perimeter from friction, producing compres-
sion in the wall, is
P1 = (yz-0.Sp0)R (11-26)
The Reimbert method computes the static pressures at any depth z (see left side of Fig.
11-23c) as

Vertical pressure: po = y \z( ^ + l)"* + y 1 (11-27)
Lateral pressure: ph = ^ - \ 1 - f ~ + i f 2 ] (11-28)

where

C = R - Z o

The total vertical force on a unit strip of wall perimeter is
Pz = (JZ-Po)R (H-29)
where terms not previously defined or used are as follows:
R = hydraulic radius = area/perimeter = D/4 for circular walls
z = depth to point where pressure is computed as on Fig. ll-23c
Zo = cone of surcharge = CD/2) tan <f>r where <j>r = angle of repose of material (also
often used for <$>)
D = internal diameter of round container (for rectangular bins use equivalent di-
ameter unless L/B is large)

Mackey and Mason (1972) proposed an analysis based on Fig. 11-24. The bottom dead
zone of height 1.75D is designed based on the Janssen equations. The pipe zone is designed
based on lateral pressures to hold an arch ring in place by friction where the ring is 0.6D

thick. The remainder of the wall height is computed using a wedge theory as shown in the
figure. The angle p shown in the figure is computed as 45° + cf>/2.
The Mackey and Mason method gives higher computed pressures than the static values
of either Janssen's or Reimbert's method so overburden pressure factors are not needed to
account for dynamic pressures during bin emptying.
Table 11-9 gives the ACI recommended overpressure factors for use with the Janssen and
Reimbert methods to increase the static pressures computed from Eqs. (11-24) through (11-
29) to design (dynamic) values.

Example 11-10. Compute the pressures acting on a wheat storage elevator that is 5 m diameter X
28.6 m high. Use all three methods presented. Use ywheat = 0.8(9.807) = 7.846 kN/m3; <£ = 28°;
8 = 24°; Zo = Om.

Solution, We will make a table of po and ph for each 5 m of depth.

1. By Janssen's method: Use Eqs.(ll-24) and (11-25):
p- = K?L[1-«*{-*>• r**8)] (11-24)
ph = poKa
For $ = 28°, Ka = 0.361 (Table 11-3). Then
tan 8 = tan 24 = 0.445 for circle/? = ^ = ^ = 1.25
4 4
With these data, program a computer and obtain the data shown in Table El 1-10 for each 5 m of
depth at the base.
We will check the base pressure as follows [and using Eq. (11-24)]:
Pv = (yz - 0.Sp0)R = [7.846(28.6) - 0.8(59.50)] 1.25 = 221 kPa
using Po at 28.6 m from Table El 1-10.
The total perimeter force = TTDPV = TT(5)(221) = 3471 kN.
The total wheat weight = 0.7854D2//ywheat
= 0.7854(52)(28.6)(7.846) = 4406 kN
The base must carry the difference between total weight and the perimeter friction giving
AP = 4 4 0 6 - 3 4 7 1 = 935 kN
Po = A A Cu = n-jocA,^ = 47.6 vs. 59.5 (but O.K.)

Area of base 0.7854(52)
This difference in po versus Table El 1-10 is due to the approximation using 0.8/?^ in Eq.
(11-24) (47.6/0.8 = 59.5).
2. By Reimbert's method (note zo — 0 here also): Rearranging Eq. (11-25) with zo — 0, we obtain
yzC
Po = ^Tz

where Ka = 0.361
tan 8 = 0.445
R = D/4 = 1.25 as for the Janssen method

Programming po and ph on a computer and incrementing z by 5 m and the base z = 28.6, we
obtain the additional data shown in Table El 1-10.
Make an approximate check:
Pv per meter of wall = area of lateral pressure diagram X tan 8

1. We have checked the computations for statics and to see if the pressures are reasonable.
2. For design we would divide the silo height into four sections and recompute the pressures po and
Ph and, based on H/D = 28.6/5 = 5.72, use the appropriate overpressure factors from Table
11-9 to factor the static pressures to design values as ph(des) = PhCd, etc.
3. By the Mackey and Mason method (Fig. 11-23):
In bottom 1.75D = 1.75(5) = 8.75 m use Janssen pressure distribution
In next (pipe) zone 2.5(5) = 12.5 m use arching
In top 2 8 . 6 - 1 2 . 5 - 8 . 7 5 = 7.35 m use wedge (plug zone)
In considering any ring arch in the pipe zone, the weight of an arch ring of height z = 0.6D
is

Friction resistance = 0.5yz2£(tan</>')7rD

Solving, we find

The lateral pressure for each ring arch (varying from 0 at top to maximum at 0.6D) is
crh = yzK = 7.846(0.6 X 5)(1.87) = 44.01 kPa
This value compares with values of 15.94 and 17.81 kPa of previous methods indicating that the
Mackey values do not require "factoring" up for design.

MECHANICALLY STABILIZED
EARTH AND CONCRETE
RETAINING WALLS

12-1 INTRODUCTION
Retaining walls are used to prevent retained material from assuming its natural slope. Wall
structures are commonly used to support earth, coal, ore piles, and water. Most retaining
structures are vertical or nearly so; however, if the a angle in the Coulomb earth-pressure
coefficient of Eq. (11-3) is larger than 90°, there is a reduction in lateral pressure that can be
of substantial importance where the wall is high and a wall tilt into the backfill is acceptable.
Retaining walls may be classified according to how they produce stability:

1. Mechanically reinforced earth—also sometimes called a "gravity" wall
2. Gravity—either reinforced earth, masonry, or concrete
3. Cantilever—concrete or sheet-pile
4. Anchored—sheet-pile and certain configurations of reinforced earth

At present, the mechanically stabilized earth and gravity walls are probably the most
used—particularly for roadwork where deep cuts or hillside road locations require retain-
ing walls to hold the earth in place. These walls eliminate the need for using natural slopes
and result in savings in both right-of-way costs and fill requirements.
Cantilever walls of reinforced concrete are still fairly common in urban areas because
they are less susceptible to vandalism and often do not require select backfill. Typically they
compete well in costs where the wall is short (20 to 50 m in length) and not very high (say,
under 4 m). They are also widely used for basement walls and the like in buildings.
This chapter will investigate the basic principles of the reinforced earth, gravity, and con-
crete cantilever wall; the sheet-pile cantilever and anchored walls will be considered sepa-
rately in the next two chapters.

12-2 MECHANICALLY REINFORCED EARTH WALLS
The mechanically reinforced earth wall of Fig. 12-1 uses the principle of placing reinforc-
ing into the backfill using devices such as metal strips and rods, geotextile strips and sheets
and grids, or wire grids. There is little conceptual difference in reinforcing soil or concrete
masses—reinforcement carries the tension stresses developed by the applied loads for either
material. Bond stresses resist rebar pullout in concrete; soil relies on friction stresses devel-
oped based on the angle of friction 5 between soil and reinforcement or a combination of
friction and passive resistance with geo- and wire grids.
The principle of reinforced earth is not new. Straw, bamboo rods, and similar alternative
materials have long been used in technologically unsophisticated cultures to reinforce mud
bricks and mud walls. Nevertheless, in spite of this long usage French architect H. Vidal was
able to obtain a patent (ca. mid-1960s) on the general configuration of Fig. 12-1, which he
termed "reinforced earth." We see three basic components in this figure:

1. The earth fill—usually select granular material with less than 15 percent passing the No.
200 sieve.
2. Reinforcement—strips or rods of metal, strips or sheets of geotextiles, wire grids, or chain
link fencing or geogrids (grids made from plastic) fastened to the facing unit and extending
into the backfill some distance. Vidal used only metal strips.
3. Facing unit—not necessary but usually used to maintain appearance and to avoid soil
erosion between the reinforcements.

These three components are combined to form a wall whose side view is shown in Fig.
12-2a. The facing units may be curved or flat metal plates or precast concrete strips or plates
(see Fig. 12-2&). Where geotextiles are used the sheet may lap, as in Fig. 12-3, to produce
the facing unit.
When wire mesh or or other reinforcement with discontinuities (grid voids) is used, a
portion may be bent, similar to the sheet of Fig. 12-3, to form a facing unit. Grid-type

reinforcements strengthen the soil through a combination of friction and passive pressure
pullout resistance. The bent-up portion used as a facing piece provides some erosion control
until the wall is completed.
The exposed reinforcements are usually sprayed with concrete mortar or gunite (material
similar to mortar) in lifts to produce a thickness on the order of 150 to 200 mm. This is
both to improve the appearance and to control erosion. For metals this covering also helps

control rust, and for geotextiles it provides protection from the ultraviolet rays1 in sunlight
and discourages vandalism.
The basic principle2 of reinforced earth is shown in Fig. 12-4 where we see a wall acted
on by either the Rankine or Coulomb active earth wedge. Full-scale tests have verified that
the earth force developed from the active earth wedge at any depth z is carried by reinforcing
strip tension.
Strip tension is developed in the zone outside the active earth wedge from the friction
angle S between strip and soil and the vertical earth pressure yz on the strip. With no lateral
earth pressure left to be carried by the wall facings they can be quite thin and flexible with
the principal functions of erosion control and appearance.
The following several factors enter into the design of a reinforced earth wall:

1. Backfill soil is usually specified to be granular; however, recent research indicates that
we can use cohesive soil if a porous geotextile is used for reinforcement to allow backfill
drainage. This allows one to use the drained friction angle </>' to calculate friction between
the soil and reinforcing.
For cohesive materials, either use a narrow vertical back face zone of granular material
or, alternatively, use strips of a permeable geotextile for vertical drainage.

1MoSt geotextiles have a rating of strength loss versus amount of ultraviolet exposure. ASTM D 4355 gives a
standard in which geotextile strength loss is reported for 150 hours of exposure.
2An extensive literature survey along with a number of applications, primarily in Europe, is given by Ingold (1982).


Pa = active earth force
Ti - tension force in reinforcement
strip (if any)
Figure 12-4 The general concept of reinforced earth is that 2 Ti = Pa cos 8, so the earth force against the wall
(or facing units) = 0.

2. Backfill soil should be compacted, taking care not to get equipment too close to the facing
unit, so that it is not pulled from the reinforcement.
It is also necessary to exercise care with geotextile fabrics not to tear the fabric in
the direction parallel to the wall. A partial tear of this type would reduce the amount of
tension the fabric can carry.
3. Tests with experimental walls indicate that the Rankine wedge (of angle p = 45° + </>/2)
adequately defines the "soil wedge." This angle should be routinely checked using the
trial wedge method (or computer program) for large backfill /3 angles.
4. The wall should be sufficiently flexible that the active earth pressure wedge forms and
any settlement/subsidence does not tear the facing unit from the reinforcement.
5. It is usual to assume all the tension stresses are in the reinforcement outside the assumed
soil wedge zone—typically the distance Le of Fig. 12-5.
6. The wall failure will occur in one of three ways:
a. Tension in the reinforcements
b. Bearing-capacity failure of the base soil supporting the wall, as along the baseline AB
of Figs. 12-3 and 12-6.
c. Sliding of the full-wall block (ACDB of Fig. 12-6) along base AB.
7. Surcharges (as in Fig. 12-6) are allowed on the backfill. These require analysis to ascer-
tain whether they are permanent (such as a roadway) or temporary and where located.
For example:
a. Temporary surcharges within the reinforcement zone will increase the lateral pressure,
which in turn increases the tension in the reinforcements but does not contribute to
reinforcement stability.

b. Permanent surcharges within the reinforcement zone will increase the lateral pressure
and tension in the reinforcements and will contribute additional vertical pressure for
the reinforcement friction.
c. Temporary or permanent surcharges outside the reinforcement zone contribute a lat-
eral pressure, which tends to overturn the wall.
In most cases the lateral pressure from a backfill surcharge can be estimated using the
Theory of Elasticity equation [Eq. (11-20)]. One can also use the Boussinesq equation
for vertical pressure, but it may be sufficiently accurate to use the 2 : 1 (2 on 1) method
[Eq. (5-2)] adjusted for plane strain to give

where Q = Bq0 for the strip width (side view) and average contact pressure produced
by the surcharge; for point loads use either a unit width (0.3 m or 1 ft) or
Eq. (5-3). Since these two methods give greatly differing vertical pressures
(the 2 : 1 is high and Eq. (5-3) is very low) you may have to use some
judgment in what to use—perhaps an average of the two methods.
B = strip width; you are implicitly using L=I unit of width.


Figure 12-6 General wall case with surcharge on backfill as from a road or other construction. Linearizing the
surcharge pressure profile as shown is sufficiently accurate.

Laba and Kennedy (1986) used the 2:1 vertical pressure method [Eq. (5-2)] as shown
in Fig. 12-5 with reasonably good results. In this figure Eq. (5-2) is being used to get a
pressure increase in the zone L\ so that the friction resistance FR for the effective lengths
(Le = L\ + L2) is
Fr = tan 8 [(y z + Ag)Z4 + JzL2]
where terms are identified in Fig. 12-5.
8. Corrosion may be a factor where metal reinforcements are used. It is common to increase
the theoretical strip thickness somewhat to allow for possible corrosion within the design
period, which may be on the order of 50 to 100 years.
9. Where aesthetics is critical, a number of concrete facing unit configurations are available
in a wide range of architecturally pleasing facades, which can either outline the wall or
blend it into the landscape (Figs. 12-2fe, d).
10. There will be two safety factors SF involved. One SF is used to reduce the ultimate
strength of the reinforcements to a "design" value. The other SF is used to increase the
computed length Le required to allow for any uncertainty in the backfill properties and
soil-to-reinforcement friction angle S.

12-3 DESIGN OF REINFORCED EARTH WALLS
The design of a reinforced earth wall proceeds basically as follows:

1. Estimate the vertical and horizontal spacing of the reinforcement strips as in Fig. 12-7.
Horizontal spacing s is meaningless for both wire grids and geotextile sheets but one must
find a suitable vertical spacing h for those materials. The vertical spacing may range from
about 0.2 to 1.5 m (8 to 60 in.) and can vary with depth; the horizontal strip spacing may
be on the order of 0.8 to 1.5 m (30 to 60 in.). The lateral-earth-pressure diagram is based
on a unit width of the wall but is directly proportional to horizontal spacing s.
2. Compute the tensile loads of the several reinforcements as the area of the pressure diagram
contributing to the strip. This calculation can usually be done with sufficient accuracy by
computing the total lateral pressure at the strip (see Fig. 12-6) level,
qKi = qh + kqh (12-1)

where qn = Rankine or Coulomb lateral earth pressure, taking into account backfill
slope and any uniform surcharge
A ^ = lateral pressure from any concentrated backfill surcharge; obtain using
your computer program SMBLPl

With the average pressure obtained from Eq. (12-1), the strip tensile force can be com-
puted as
Tt = AcqKi (12-la)
where Ac = contributory area, computed (including the horizontal spacing s) as
_ hj + hj+i
^c — 2

One should routinely make a computational check:
^ T r , = sX (Pah + area of A<? diagram) (12-lfc)

Reinforcements


That is, the sum of the several tensile reinforcement forces should equal the lateral-earth-
pressure diagram ratioed from a unit width to the actual reinforcement spacing s.
Although Fig. 12-6 does not show the correct pressure profile for a surcharge qo and
/3 > 0 (for that case refer to Fig. ll-9c and use Ka, which includes the effect of /3), it is
a common case. The other common case is a sloping backfill (Fig. 11 -9b) but no concen-
trated surcharge.
3. Compute the strip lengths Le of Fig. 12-5 that are required to develop a friction resistance
Fr = T1 X SF (or !^,design = ^,computed x SF). From these lengths and the Rankine wedge
zone we can then determine the overall strip length L0 to use. It is common to use a single
length for the full wall height so that the assembly crew does not have to be concerned
with using an incorrect length at different elevations; however, this choice is a designer's
prerogative. The friction length is based on soil-to-strip friction of / = tan 6, where 8 =
some fraction of cf> such as 1.0,0.8,0.6</>. What to use depends on the roughness of the strip
(or geotextile sheet). For rough materials use 8 = 4>; for smooth metal strips use 8 ~ 20
to 25°.
For strips of b X Le or geotextile sheets of base width X Le, both sides resist in fric-
tion. For round bars the perimeter resists friction. In both cases friction is the product of
/ X normal pressure on the reinforcement, computed as po = yn where n = average
depth from ground surface to reinforcement. Using consistent units, this approach gives
the following reinforcements:
Strip: Fr = 2{yzt){b X L6) tan8 > T1 X SF (l2-2a)
Rod: Fr = irD(yZi)L6tend > T1 X SF (12-26)
Sheet: Fr = 2{yzdi\ x L6) tan 8 > T1 X SF (12-2c)
where b = strip width, D = rod diameter, and 1 = unit sheet width. Manufacturers pro-
vide geotextiles in rolls of various lengths and widths.3 For the year 1993 and earlier, the
Specifier's Guide of fabric specifications listed roll dimensions of geotextiles the given
manufacturer could supply. For 1994 and later, the roll dimensions are no longer supplied.
The supplier should be contacted prior to design to see what fabric dimensions can be
provided.
4. Next compute the reinforcement area for strips b X t and for rods with bar diam-
eter D. For wire and geotextile grids, obtain the tension force per some unit of width.
For geotextile sheets look in the manufacturer's catalog to find a fabric with a suitable
strength.
For these materials a suitable SF must be used to reduce the ultimate tensile strength
of metal strips and bars to a design value or the geotextile strength (which is, by the way,
orientation-sensitive) to a design value. For metals it is common to use some SF such as
1.5 to 1.67; however, for both metals and geotextiles we can compute an SF based on
partial safety factors as follows:

r a l l o w = Tult (sF

i d X SFcr X SFcd X SFbd X SFif X SF^ )

available geotextile fabrics and select engineering properties such as tensile strength and permeability.

The preceding values (not all are in his table) can be used, since you have to estimate them
anyway.

Let us now consider a geotextile example. From the 1995 Specifier's Guide we find an
Amoco 2044 woven (W) geotextile with a wide-width tensile strength, using the ASTM
D 4595 method, of 70.05 kN/m in both the MD (along the roll) and XD (across the roll)
directions. The allowable tensile strength is computed using Eq. (12-3). Substituting some
estimated values, we obtain

= 16.08-* 16.0 kN/m
.1 General Comments
For geotextiles we have a problem in that the fabric strength varies

1. Between manufacturers.
2. With fabric type and grade. For example, woven fabric is usually stronger than film fabric
and additionally has a larger coefficient of friction.
3. With direction. The MD direction {machine direction, also warp; that is, with the roll) is
stronger than (or as strong as) the XD direction {cross-machine, ox fill; that is, across the
roll—transverse to the roll length). Sometimes the strength difference is on the order of
XD « 0.5MD. This means that attention to the strength direction during placing may be
critical.
We must test (or have tested by the mill, or use an independent testing laboratory) the fabric to
obtain the strength, usually in kN/m (or lb/in.) of width. From the several choices we choose
a strip so that
Strip width b X design strength/unit width > Ti


Strip design may require several iterations to set the horizontal and vertical reinforcement
spacing. Since fabric cost is relatively small compared with other costs (engineering time,
backfill, etc.) and since there is some uncertainty in this type of analysis, a modest amount
of overdesign is acceptable.
Metal reinforcement strips currently available are on the order of b = 75 to 100 mm and t
on the order of 3 to 5 mm, with 1 mm on each face excluded for corrosion. Concrete reinforc-
ing rods are often used for their roughness, but with one end prepared for attachment to the
face piece—by welding or threads. Rod diameters should be at least three times larger than
the average (D50) particle diameters of the granular backfill so adequate friction contact is
developed. Particle diameter is less critical with wire grids since the grid bars perpendicular
to the tension rods provide considerable additional pullout resistance.
The pullout forces and resistance are assumed to be developed as shown in Fig. 12-4 where
a tension from the wall face to the Rankine/Coulomb rupture zone defined by the angle p
develops to a maximum at the wedge line. Even with a sloping backfill and/or surcharges the
Rankine wedge shown is generally used. This tension is resisted by the friction developing
outside the zone along length Le of Fig. 12-5, so we can write, from the differential equation
shown on Fig. 12-4,
C Le
T = 2b(po tan 8) d L
Jo
This expression may be somewhat of a simplification, and 2b must be replaced with the
perimeter (TTD) for round bars, but it seems to allow an adequate wall design.
Most of the construction technology currently used for reinforced earth walls is under
patent protection; however, it is important to understand the principles involved and methods
of analysis both in order to make a reasonable decision on the best system for a site and
because the patents on some of the walls will expire shortly and the method(s) will transfer
to the public domain.

12-3.2 Soil Nailing
Using "nails" to reinforce the earth is a relatively recent (about 20 years old) method for soil
reinforcement. Basically this consists in either driving small-diameter rods (on the order of
25 to 30 mm) into the earth or drilling holes on the order of 150 to 200 mm, inserting the
required diameter (again 25- to 30-mm) rod, and filling the remainder of the hole with grout
(usually a cement-sand mixture with a low enough viscosity that it can be pumped).
The essential difference between soil nailing and tieback walls (of Chap. 14) is that there
is little prestress applied to the soil nails, whereas the tieback wall requires prestressing the
rods.
Soil nailing has the advantage of being suitable both for walls and for excavation support.
For walls one starts the wall upward and at specified levels inserts "nails" into the backfill.
The wall then proceeds and the nail is attached to the wall (often through a prepared hole with
a face plate and a nut for fastening). In excavations some depth is excavated, the nails are
inserted, and wall is added and attached as for the retaining wall. The next level is excavated,
nails are inserted, wall facing is added and attached, etc.
The rods are usually inserted or drilled at a slope from the horizontal of about 15°, but
near the upper part of the wall the slope may be larger (20 to 25°) to avoid underground util-
ities.

The latest soil nail insertion technique consists in using a compressed-air driver that fires
(or launches) the nail at high velocity into the soil. The tip is the launch point, so the nail rod is
pulled rather than driven into position. Pulling avoids rod buckling, since the nail diameters
for current air launchers are on the order of 25 to 40 mm for depths of 3 to 6 m—larger
diameters may be used but smaller penetration depths result. This type of device can fire a
nail at any orientation and at a rate of up to 15 per hour. The nail head is normally prefitted
with a threaded portion or prefastened to an arresting collar so that it is not fired too far into
the ground for accessibility.
Rod spacing varies between 1 and 4 m2 of wall surface area depending on factors such
as type of retained soil, wall height, available space behind the wall for rod penetration, rod
diameter, and designer caution.
Although the analysis is somewhat similar to other reinforced earth walls there are some
differences. Usually the analysis consists in a global stability analysis using a slope stability
program. The slope stability program must be specifically modified to allow locating the rods
(if they protrude through the trial circle arc).
It may also require modification to use a portion of a logarithmic spiral as the failure surface
rather than part of a circle. A rod stability analysis for both tension (or pullout) and bending
(on the potential slip plane) is also required—but often just for pullout.
One can make a reasonable wall design with reference to Fig. 12-8 as follows:
1. Estimate the rod tension Ti using the appropriate pressure diagram of Fig. 12-8& (see
similarity with Fig. 14-5), the position of the rod (upper \, middle \, or lower |), and
the spacing. Use the equation shown on the figure for J1-. You should compute a table
with the several values of Tt. Since all the rods should be the same diameter D, select the
largest T/.


2. Compute the required rod diameter D for this tension using a suitable SF so that fa =
fy/SF of rod steel (or other rod material). With T1 and fa, compute

D = V 0.7854/.
3. Estimate the nail friction resistance (outside the modified Rankine wedge zone of Fig.
12-Sa) using Eq. (Yl-Ib). Use the actual rod diameter if the rod is driven, but use the
grouted diameter if the rod is put in a drilled hole and grouted. Use tan S = estimated
value for soil-metal interface based on metal roughness. Use S = </> for grouted rods. For
sloping rods use an average depth zt in the length outside the wedge zone. One must use
a trial process for finding the computed distance Le>comp—that is, assume a length and
compute the resistance Fr > Tt. Several values may be tried, depending on whether all
rods are to be the same length, or variable lengths (depending on wall location) are to be
used. In any case increase the computed length as
^e,des — o r * /^,comp
Compute the total rod (nail) length Z401 at any location as the length just computed for pull-
out resistance L^des + length LR to penetrate through the Rankine wedge zone, giving the
following:
^tot — Ledes + LR
It will be useful to make a table of nail lengths Ltot versus depth z to obtain the final design
length(s). One has the option of either using a single nail length or of locating elevations
where the nail length changes occur if different nail lengths are used.
4. Make a scaled plot of the wall height, modified Rankine wedge, rod locations, and their
slopes and lengths. Use this plot to make your slope stability analysis. Clearly one possi-
bility is to use a regular slope stability computer program and ignore the "nails."

There is already an enormous amount of literature as well as at least three separate design
procedures for nailed walls. The reader is referred to Jewell and Pedley (1992), Juran et al.
(1990) and ASCE Geotechnical SP No. 12 (1987) for design information sources or to build
confidence in the procedure outlined above.

12-3.3 Examples
We will examine the reinforced earth methodology further in the following three examples.

Example 12-1. Analyze the wall of Fig. E12-1 using strip reinforcement. The strips will be ten-
tatively spaced at s = I m and h = 1 m and centered on the concrete wall facing units. We will
use interlocking reinforced concrete facing units, shaped as indicated, that are 200 mm thick (with
a mass of about 1000 kg or 9.807 kN each). A wall footing will be poured to provide alignment and
to spread the facing unit load somewhat, since their total mass is more than an equivalent volume
of soil. A 150-mm thick reinforced cap will be placed on top of the wall to maintain top alignment
and appearance.

Required. Analyze a typical interior vertical section and select tension strips based on fy =
250 MPa and fa = 250/1.786 = 140 MPa. Other data: <j> = 34°; y = 17.30 kN/m3; and assume
8 = 0.7 X 34 = 24°.


Solution. From Table 11-3 obtain Ka = 0.283
/ = tanS-> tan 24° = 0.445
Set up the following table from wall data (Le is computed after Tt and strip width b are computed):

~ T1 x SF
Strip Z19 T1 = yzid x l)Ka9 U = 2btan8iyzi)9

8 7.5 36.72 |
9 8.5 41.62 I
10 9.5 46.51 4.77
XT; =244.80kN

Check:
pa = \yH2Ka [Eq. (11-9) and s = 1 m = unit width]
Pa = i(17.30)(102)(0.283) = 244.80 kN/m
Next we find the cross section of the reinforcement strips. Tentatively try b = 100 mm since the
wall is 10 m high.
b x t X fa = T1 (a SF is already on fa)
The largest Tt is strip 10, so for T\o we have
0.100(0(140) = 46.51 kN (using meters)

' = 0.10(140)1000 " 0 0 ° 3 3 2 m ^ 3.32 mm, so use t = 5.0 mm
This value allows a little less than 1-mm loss on each side for corrosion. Next find the strip length
for Tt and total strip length L0. We equate tan 8 X vertical pressure po on both sides of strip of width
b X Le to the strip tension T1 X SF. Get T1 from the preceding table and use an SF = 1.5:
2b(tmS)(y Zt)L6 = T1(SF)
Rearranging into solution form for Le, we have
= (SF)Tj = 1.5Tj
2b(\an8)(yzi) 2(0.10)(0.445 X 17.3Oz1-)
This equation can be programmed. The first value (for n = 0.50 m) is
1.5(2.45)
Le= 1.5397(0.50) = 4 - 7 ? m
Other values for z/ = 1.5, 2.5, 3.5,..., 9.5 are similarly computed and we find them constant as
shown in the preceding table. We now find total strip lengths L0 as follows:
p = 45° + 4>/2 = 45° + 34°/2 = 62°
The Rankine zone at 9.5 m (strip 1) is
LR = 9.5 x tan(90° - 62°) = 9.5 X tan 28° = 5.05 m
L0 = LR + Le = 5.05 + 4.77 = 9.82 m
We can use this length for all of the strips or, noting that the Rankine zone has a linear variation,
we can use a linear variation in the strip lengths and apply careful construction inspection to ensure
the correct strip lengths are used. This wall is high, so considerable savings can be had by using
variable strip lengths. Do it this way:
At 0.5 m above base: L0 = 0.5 X tan 28° + 4.77 = 5.04 m
At 4.5 m above base: L0 = 4.5 X tan 28° + 4.77 = 7.16 m
At 9.5 m above base (top strip): L0 = 9.82 m
As a check, plot the wall to scale, plot these three strip lengths, connect them with a line, and read
off the other strip lengths.
Bearing capacity. We should check the bearing capacity for a unit width strip with a footing width
B of either 9.82 or 5.04 m depending on strip configuration. Take all shape, depth, and inclination
factors = 1.0. The poured footing for the concrete facing units will have a unit length but should
have a B that is wide enough (greater than the 200-mm thickness of the wall units) that the bearing
pressures for backfill and facing units are approximately equal to avoid settlement of the facing
units and possibly tearing out the reinforcement strips.
Sliding resistance. The wall should resist sliding. Assuming a linear variation of reinforcement
strips, we will have a block of soil that is one unit wide of weight W = yHBw(LO). Note that
sliding is soil-to-soil, so take tan 8 = tan </>. Inserting values, we have
W = 17.30(10)9'82 ^ 5 ' 0 4 X 1 = 1286 kN
FR = Wtan4>= 1286tan34° = 867 kN » Pa = 244.8 kN
Sliding stability = ^JT~^ = 3.5


The wall should be drawn to a reasonable scale with all critical dimensions shown to complete
the design. Owing to limited text space this figure is not included here.

Example 12-2. Compute the reinforcement tension and friction resistance to obtain a tentative strip
length L0 for the wall of Fig. E12-2 with a surcharge on the backfill. Check the strip at the 1.5-m
depth (Ts) to illustrate the general procedure with a surcharge.
Soil data: y = 17.30 kN/m3; <f> = 32° (backfill); take / = tanS = 0.4 as the coefficient of
friction between backfill soil and strip.
Strip data: h = 0.30 m; s = 0.60 m; width b = 75 mm; SF = 2.0 on steel of fy = 250 MPa;
SF = 2.0 on soil friction.

Solution. Obtain Rankine Ka = 0.307 from Table 11-3. Use your computer program SMBLPl to
obtain the lateral pressure profile for the surcharge. Assume plane strain, the B dimension of 1.5
m as shown, and a length of 1 m consistent with the Rankine wall pressures. A good approach is
to use unit areas of 1.5/5 = 0.3 (NSQW = 5) and 1.0/4 = 0.25 (NSQL = 4) so that PSQR =
100(0.3 X 0.25) = 7.5 kN. When requested by the program, have the wall pressure profile output
along with the total wall force so you can compare these to the values plotted on Fig. E12-2. You
can use a "point" load at 2.25 m from wall with P = 150 kN and obtain almost "exact" pressures
from 1.5 m down to the 6.0 m depth, but in the upper 1.5 m the pressures are somewhat in error.
At the 1.5-m depth the Rankine earth pressure is

Surcharge profile

Figure E12-2


At this depth (also 4.5 m above base) program SMBLPl gives
Aq = 5.9 kPa
The design pressure is the sum of the two pressures, giving
to = qR + Aq = 8.0 + 5.9 = 13.9 kPa
The strip design force is
T5 = Fdes = qdes(h X s)
= 13.9(0.30X0.60) = 2.50kN/strip
The allowable strip tension fa = fy/SF = 250/2 =125 MPa. The strip cross section of b X t with
b = 75 mm is
HO fa = T5 -»t = ^ g
Inserting values, we obtain
f = 0.075x?25xl000= a °0 0 2 7 m -f t 2 7 m m
Use t = 3 mm (to allow for corrosion)
The force Fdes = T$ must be resisted by friction developed on both sides of the strip of length Le
outside the Rankine wedge zone. This force will be assumed to be made of two parts, so Le =
L1 + L2.
From the sketch drawn to scale we can scale the length L\ or directly compute it as follows:
Distance to right edge of surcharge =1.5 + 1.5 = 3m
Distance from wall = LR + L\
= distance to right of surcharge + 1.5/2
LR+ Lx = 3.0 + 1.5/2 = 3.75 m
L1 = 3.75 - L*
L1 = 3.75- 4.5 tan(90°-p)
= 3.75 - 2.49 = 1.26 m (L* = 2.49 m)
In this region the vertical pressure is

po = 17.30(1.5) + !5 + 2 ^ 5 ) = 26 + 50 = 76 kPa
Now equating friction resistance to tension and using the given SF = 2 we have
2b[(poton8)Li + (yz,-tan S)L2] = 2.50(SF)
Inserting values (remember that tan 8 was given as 0.4), we obtain
2(0.075)[(76)(0.4)L! + 17.30(1.5)(0.4)L2] = 2.50(2)
Thus, we have
4.56L1 + 1.56L2 = 5.0
It appears we do not need an L2 contribution. If on solving for L1 we obtain a value > 1.26, we will
set L1 = 1.26 and solve for the L2 contribution,
L1 = -^- = 1.09 m (less than 1.26 m furnished, so result is O.K.)
4.56


The total length at this point is
L0 = LR + LI -> 2.49 + 1.09 = 3.58 m
To complete the design, we must check other strip locations. Again one can use one length for
all strips or use variable strip lengths, or use one strip length for the lower half of the wall and a
different strip length for the upper half.
The remaining steps include the following:

1. Find the strip thickness based on the largest 7V The Rankine earth pressure at Zt = H = 5.85
m is
qR = 17.30 X 5.85 X 0.307 = 31.1 kPa
and for the strip (including 0.5 for surcharge) is
T21 = (31.1 + 0.5)(0.3 X 0.6) = 5.7 kN
2. Check bearing capacity.
3. Check sliding stability.

Example 12-3. This example illustrates using geotextiles instead of strips for the wall design. The
author's computer program GEOWALL will be used, since a substantial output is provided in a
compact format and there is much busy work in this type of wall design. Refer to Fig. E12-3a and
the following data:

Backfill soil: y = 17.10 kN/m3; <t> = 36°; c = 0.0 kPa;
backfill slope / 3 = 0 ° ; Poisson's ratio /UL = 0.0
These are the input data here but the program also allows a
concentrated backfill surcharge.
Base soil: y = 18.10 kN/m3; </> = 15°; c = 2OkPa;
5 = 12° (soil to fabric); cohesion reduction factor a = 0 . 8
(soca = 0.8X20 = 16kPa)
Note all these data are shown on the output sheets (Fig. E12-3b).
The geotextile will be tentatively selected from the 1994 Specifier's Guide published annually
by the Industrial Fabrics Association International in the "Geotextiles" section as a Carthage Mills
20 percent fabric with a wide-width tensile strength of 32.4 kN/m. It has a permeability of 0.55
L/min/m2, which should be adequate for a sandy backfill.
A geotextile wall design consists in obtaining an optimum balance between fabric weight (a
function of strength), spacing, and length. This can be done in a reasonable amount of time only by
using a computer. What does the computer program do that otherwise one would do by hand?

1. Compute the Rankine wall pressures and any Boussinesq surcharge pressures (here there are
no Boussinesq-type surcharges, but there is a uniform surcharge of 10 kPa). These are always
output in the first listed table using equal spacings of 0.3 m (or 1 ft) down the wall (Fig.
E12-3Z?). The Rankine and Boussinesq values are summed, as these would be used to com-
pute fabric tensile force at these locations. Note that \0Ka = 10(0.2597) = 2.597 kPa as top
table entry.
Also found at this initial spacing are the total wall resultant (RFORC = 50.074 kN) for any
surcharges -I- Rankine resultant and the location YBARl = y = 1.552 m above the base.
2. Next the program checks sliding stability based on asking for an input value for Ns (usual
range between 2 and 3—the author used 2). For this value of Ns a base fabric length of 3.0 m
is required.
3. The program then outputs to the screen the first table shown and asks whether the user wants
to change any of the vertical spacings. The author did, and elected to use 0.4-m (16-in.) layers
for the upper 3.6 m of wall height and 0.3-m (12-in.) layers for the last 0.6 m (3.6 + 0.6 =
4.2). These values were chosen to give a reasonable balance between number of sheets and
excessively thick soil layers. One could obtain a solution using 0.6 m for six layers and 0.3 m
for two layers at the bottom for some savings; however, although 0.6 m (24-in.) might produce
a more economical wall, the facing part may be at risk, and if one of the geotextile layers went
bad, the internal spacing would be unacceptable in that region.
4. The program recomputes the earth pressures, the backfill, and any surcharges at the new spacing
(the spacings can be changed any number of times—or repeated) and outputs this spacing (nine
at 0.4 m and two at 0.3 m) to screen and asks whether this is O.K. or to change it. The author
answered O.K., and this was used.
5. Next compute the fabric lengths for tension. This result is also output in a table as shown. The
program has a preset S F = 1.4 here but also requires a preset minimum distance for fabric
lengths Le:
a. If the computed Le < 0.5 m (18 in.) use 0.5 m.
b. If the computed Le is 0.5 < L6 < 1 m use 1.0 m.
c. If the computed L6 > 1.0 m use the computed value.
We need 3.00 m for the first layer—not for tension but for the sliding SF computed earlier. The
top layer (layer 11) requires


The program does not make "exact" computations here. It takes the distance from layer i — 1
to layer i X qhl X SF = 1.4 to compute sheet tension. Strictly, the tension force should use a
zone centered (or nearly so) on the sheet, but the error from not doing this is negligible. In this
example the preset minimum Le = 0.500 m controls for the full wall height.
The required sheet length Le is computed using the vertical distance from the backfill surface
to the ith layer to compute the vertical sheet pressure. Both sides are used and with av tan 8 and
(if applicable) adhesion ca.
On the basis of a screen display of this table the program asks what lengths the user wants
to use. A single length or up to five different lengths can be used. From the table the author
elected to uSe a single length for all layers of 3.00 m. This is less confusing to the construction
crews, and besides in the upper several layers there are not much savings.
6. With the length selected the program next computes bearing capacity along AB of Fig.
E12-3c using the length of layer 1 as B. It presents to the screen the stability number based on
SF = qu\\/qv, where qv = yti 4- ^surcharge- Shown on the output, the SF = 3.985.
7. On the basis of the length and any surface surcharges, the program computes the overturning
stability about point A of Fig. E12-3c (the toe). This is far from a rigid body, but conventional
design makes a rigid body assumption. Here use block ADCB with a surcharge on DC. This
gives a block of width = 3.0 m and height = 4.2 m. The overturning moment from the hori-
zontal force is
Phy = MO = 50.074(1.552) = 77.71 kN • m
The resisting moment consists of two parts—one is the block mass and the other is block fric-
tion. Block friction is based on the concept that the the block cannot turn over without devel-
oping a vertical friction force on its back face of Pah tan <t> (it is soil-to-soil), and the block has
a moment arm that equals block width (here 3.0 m):
Mr = Wx = [4.2(3.0)(17.1)+ 3.0(10)]1.5 = 368.19kN-m
The program asks whether this is satisfactory, and it is.
8. As a final step the program produces the last table shown. It uses the vertical spacing, assumes
an overlap of 1 m, and obtains the length of fabric to be ordered. For example for layer 11 we
have space = 0.40 m + lap = 1.00 + required Le = 3.00 m, or
Ltot = 0.40 + 1.00 + 3.00 = 4.40 m (as shown in the table)
At the bottom, Z40I = 0.30 + 1.00 + 3.00 = 4.30 m (also as shown).
9. In the last column the actual geotextile stress fr is shown, which varies with Rankine tension
stress. The fa is computed using the input partial SF values listed on output sheet 1 [Eq. (12-3),
which is programmed into this program]. From the output sheet we find that the partial SF, in
combination gives SF = 2.265 and
f« = I t = T ^ = 14.3 kPa (shown)
or z. Zo j
From inspection of fr we see the following stresses for layers 1,3, and 4:

Layer /r , kPa / „ kPa
1 14.44 14.30
3 16.84 14.30
4 15.23 14.30

What do we do? Use this fabric-soil combination, or a stronger fabric, or a closer spacing. We
probably would not want to use a closer spacing, so that leaves either using this fabric or a

stronger one (which will cost more). Let us look again at the partial SF/. Near the base, chemical
degradation could be 1.2 instead of 1.3—this change gives SF = 2.09 instead of 2.265 and an
allowable fa = 34.4/2.09 = 16.4 kN/m.
Since the required fr is computed using the same SF as on the geotextile we have in general,
fr = vertical space X qR X SF
and before adjusting the SF,
fR = 0.4(18.58)(2.265) = 16.83 kN/m (as on output sheet)
After adjusting SF,
fR = 0.4(18.58)(2.09) = 15.53 kN/m < 16.4 (O.K.)
10. All that is left is to draw a neat sketch so the construction crew can build the wall. Next deter-
mine the wall length (we would use one width of 4.40 m) and determine the number of rolls of
geotextile needed, and the project is designed.

Comment This geotextile may not be available in a 4.40 m width. If there is a large enough quan-
tity, the mill might set up a special run to produce the desired (or a slightly larger) width. Otherwise
it will be necessary to search the catalog for another producer. Since part of the design depends on


available widths, it should be evident that a highly precise design is not called for. Also, the Rankine
zone appears to be more of a segment of a log spiral than the wedge shown, so it may not exceed
0.3// in any case. The reason for this statement is that we would search for an available fabric of
width between 4.1 and 4.6 m with a strength > 32A kN/m as satisfactory.

124 CONCRETE RETAINING WALLS
Figure 12-9 illustrates a number of types of walls of reinforced concrete or masonry. Of these,
only the reinforced concrete cantilever wall (b) and the bridge abutment (J) are much used
at present owing to the economics of reinforced earth.
The reinforced earth configuration produces essentially the gravity walls of Fig. 2-9a and
the crib wall of Fig. 12-9 J. The "stretcher" elements in the crib wall function similarly to the
reinforcement strips in reinforced earth walls.
The counterfort wall (c) may be used when a cantilever wall has a height over about 7
m. Counterforts (called buttresses if located on the front face of the wall) are used to allow
a reduction in stem thickness without excessive outward deflection. These walls have a high
labor and material cost, so they do not compete economically with reinforced earth. They
may be used on occasion in urban areas where aesthetics, space limitations, or vandalism is
a concern.
There are prefabricated proprietary (patented) walls that may compete at certain sites with
other types of walls. Generally the producer of the prefabricated wall provides the design
procedures and enough other data so that a potential user can make a cost comparison from
the several alternatives.
Cantilever and prefabricated retaining walls are analyzed similarly, so a basic understand-
ing of the cantilever procedure will enable a design review of a prefabricated wall for those
cases where a cost comparison is desired.
The focus of the rest of this chapter is on the design of reinforced concrete cantilever
retaining walls (as shown in Fig. 12-9b).
For reinforced concrete, the concept of Strength Design (USD) was used in Chaps. 8
through 10 for foundations. In those chapters multiple load factors were used, but they did
not overly complicate the design. In wall design the use of load factors is not so direct, and,
further, the ACI 318- does not provide much guidance—that is, the Code user must do some
interpretation of Code intent.
When the USD was first introduced in the mid-1960s, it was common to use a single load
factor (1.7 to 2.0) applied to any load or pressure to obtain an "ultimate" value to use in
the USD equations. However, there is some question whether the use of a single load factor
is correct, and ACI 318- is of no help for this. Retaining wall design procedures are often
covered in reinforced concrete (RJC) design textbooks and range from using a single load
factor to using multiple load factors—but only with USD since R/C design textbooks are
based on this method.
For these and other reasons stated later the author has decided there is considerable merit
in using the Alternate Design Method (ADM). This was the only method used prior to the
mid-1960s, but it is still considered quite acceptable by both ACI 318- and AASHTO.
The ACI318- places more emphasis on the USD because of claimed economies in building
construction, but the AASHTO bridge manuals (including the latest one) give about equal
consideration to both methods.

The ADM procedure will be used here so that we can avoid the use of multiple load factors
and the associated problems of attempting to mix earth pressures (LF = 1.7) with vertical
soil and wall loads (LF = 1.4) and surcharge loads (some with LF = 1.4 and others with
LF = ?). For retaining walls the ADM has two advantages:

1. The resulting wall design may (in some cases) be slightly more conservative than strength
design unless load factors larger than the minimum are used.
2. The design is much simpler since all LF = 1 and thus less prone to error than the strength
design method. Aside from this, the equations for design depth d and required steel area
As are also easier to use.

12-5 CANTILEVER RETAINING WALLS
Figure 12-10 identifies the parts and terms used in retaining wall design. Cantilever walls
have these principal uses at present:

1. For low walls of fairly short length, "low" being in terms of an exposed height on the order
of 1 to 3.0 m and lengths on the order of 100 m or less.
2. Where the backfill zone is limited and/or it is necessary to use the existing soil as backfill.
This restriction usually produces the condition of Fig. 11-12&, where the principal wall
pressures are from compaction of the backfill in the limited zone defined primarily by the
heel dimension.
3. In urban areas where appearance and durability justify the increased cost.

In these cases if the existing ground stands without caving for the depth of vertical ex-
cavation in order to place (or pour) the wall footing and later the stem, theoretically there is
no lateral earth pressure from the existing backfill. The lateral wall pressure produced by the
limited backfill zone of width b can be estimated using Eqs. (11-18) or (11-19)—this latter is
option 8 in your program FFACTOR. There is a larger lateral pressure from compacting the
backfill (but of unknown magnitude), which may be accounted for by raising the location of
the resultant from H/3 to 0.4 to 0.5// using Eq. (11-15). Alternatively, use K0 instead of Ka
with the H/3 resultant location.

Figure 12-10 Principal terms used with retaining
walls. Note that "toe" refers to both point O and the dis-
tance from front face of stem; similarly "heel" is point h
or distance from backface of stem to h.

It is common for cantilever walls to use a constant wall thickness on the order of 250 mm
to seldom over 300 mm. This reduces the labor cost of form setting, but some overdesign
should be used so that the lateral pressure does not produce a tilt that is obvious—often even
a few millimeters is noticeable.
You can use your program FADBEMLP to compute an estimate of the tilt by using fixity
at the stem base and loading the several nodes down the wall with the computed pressure
diagram converted to nodal forces using the average end area method. Of course, it is possible
to build a parallel-face wall with an intentional back tilt, but there will be extra form-setting
costs.
Figure 12-11 gives common dimensions of a cantilever wall that may be used as a guide
in a hand solution. Since there is a substantial amount of busy work in designing a retaining
wall because of the trial process, it is particularly suited to a computer analysis in which the
critical data of y, 0, H, and a small base width B are input and the computer program (for
example, the author's B-24) iterates to a solution.
The dimensions of Fig. 12-11 are based heavily on experience accumulated with stable
walls under Rankine conditions. Small walls designed for lateral pressures from compaction,
and similar, may produce different dimensions.
It is common, however, for the base width to be on the order of about 0.5H, which de-
pends somewhat on the toe distance (B/3 is shown, but it is actually not necessary to have
any toe). The thickness of the stem and base must be adequate for wide-beam shear at their
intersections. The stem top thickness must be adequate for temperature-caused spalls and
impacts from equipment/automobiles so that if a piece chips off, the remainder appears safe
and provides adequate clear reinforcement cover.
The reinforcement bars for bending moments in the stem back require 70 mm clear cover4
(against ground) as shown in Fig. \2-\2a. This requirement means that, with some T and S
bars on the front face requiring a clear cover of 50 mm + tension rebar diameter + 70 mm and
some thickness to develop concrete compression for a moment, a minimum top thickness of
about 200 mm is automatically mandated.

tilever retaining wall. Batter shown is optional.

4Actually the ACI Code Art. 7-7.1 allows 50 mm when the wall stem is built using forms—the usual case. The
code requires 70 mm only when the stem (or base) is poured directly against the soil.

since the "slip" along ab is soil-to-soil. In any case compute P^ = Pah tan $ as being most nearly correct.

Walls are designed for wide-beam shear with critical locations as indicated in ACI 318-.
The author suggests, however, taking the wide-beam shear at the stem face (front and back)
for the base slab as being more conservative and as requiring a negligible amount of extra
concrete. For the stem one should take the critical wide-beam location at the top of the base
slab. The reason is that the base is usually poured first with the stem reinforcement set. Later
the stem forms are set and poured, producing a discontinuity at this location.
Formerly, a wood strip was placed into the base slab and then removed before the stem was
placed. This slot or key provided additional shear resistance for the stem, but this is seldom
done at present. Without the key at this discontinuity, the only shear resistance is the bonding
that develops between the two pours + any friction from the stem weight + reliance on the
stem reinforcement for shear. ACI Art. 11.7.5 with the reduction given in Art. A.7.6 gives a
procedure for checking shear friction to see if shear reinforcement is required at this location.
The required ACI equation seems to give adequate resistance unless the wall is quite high.

12-6 WALLSTABILITY
Figure 12-12 illustrates the general considerations of wall stability. The wall must be struc-
turally stable against the following:
1. Stem shear and bending due to lateral earth pressure on the stem. This is a separate analysis
using the stem height.

(a) Wall pressure to use for shear and
bending moment in stem design.
Also shown is bearing capacity pressure
diagram based on Fig. 4-4 using
B' =b -2e and L = L' = 1 unit.

(b) Wall pressure for overall stability against overturning and
sliding. Wc = weight of all concrete (stem and base); Ws =
weight of soil in zone acde. Find moment arms xt any way
practical — usually using parts of known geometry.
Use this lateral pressure for base design and bearing
capacity.

70 mm clear

50 or 70 mm clear "Virtual" back


2. Base shear and bending moments at the stem caused by the wall loads producing bearing
pressure beneath the wall footing (or base). The critical section for shear should be at the
stem faces for both toe and heel. Toe bending is seldom a concern but for heel bending the
critical section should be taken at the approximate center of the stem reinforcement and
not at the stem backface.
The author suggests that for base bending and shear one use the rectangular bearing
pressure (block abde) given on Fig. 12-12a in order to be consistent with bearing-capacity
computations (see Fig. 4-4) for qa. A trapezoidal diagram (acf) is also used but the com-
putations for shear and moment are somewhat more complicated.

12-6.1 Sliding and Overturning Wall Stability
The wall must be safe against sliding. That is, sufficient friction Fr must be developed be-
tween the base slab and the base soil that a safety factor SF or stability number N5 (see Fig.
12-12Z?)is
SF = N5 = FrpPp 2> 1.25 to 2.0 (12-4)
Pah
All terms are illustrated in Fig. Yl-YIb. Note that for this computation the total vertical force
R is
R = Wc + Ws + P'av
These several vertical forces are shown on Fig. 12-126. The heel force P'av is sometimes not
included for a more conservative stability number. The friction angle S between base slab
and soil can be taken as 4> where the concrete is poured directly onto the compacted base
soil. The base-to-soil adhesion is usually a fraction of the cohesion—values of 0.6 to 0.8 are
commonly used. Use a passive force Pp if the base soil is in close contact with the face of the
toe. One may choose not to use the full depth of D in computing the toe Pp if it is possible
a portion may erode. For example, if a sidewalk or roadway is in front of the wall, use the
full depth (but not the surcharge from the sidewalk or roadway, as that may be removed for
replacement); for other cases one must make a site assessment.
The wall must be safe against overturning about the toe. If we define these terms:
x = location of R on the base slab from the toe or point O. It is usual to require this
distance be within the middle ^ of distance Ob—that is, x > B/3 from the toe.
Pah = horizontal component of the Rankine or Coulomb lateral earth pressure against the
vertical line ab of Fig. 12-12Z? (the "virtual" back).
y = distance above the base Ob to Pah.
Pav = vertical shear resistance on virtual back that develops as the wall tends to turn over.
This is the only computation that should use Pav. The 8 angle used for Pav should
be on the order of the residual angle <j>r since the Rankine wedge soil is in the state
of Fig. 11-lc and "follows" the wall as it tends to rotate.
We can compute a stability number N0 against overturning as
No= Mr = XWt + P-B^ 1 5 t o 2 Q
M0 Pahy
In both Eqs. (12-4) and (12-5) the stability number in the given range should reflect the
importance factor and site location. That is, if a wall failure can result in danger to human life


or extensive damage to a major structure, values closer to 2.0 should be used. Equation (12-5)
is a substantial simplification used to estimate overturning resistance. On-site overturning is
accompanied by passive resistances at (1) the top region of the base slab at the toe, (2) a zone
along the heel at cb that tends to lift a soil column along the virtual back face line ab, and (3)
the slip of the Rankine wedge on both sides of ab. Few walls have ever overturned—failure
is usually by sliding or by shearoff of the stem.
The ^L(WC + W8) and location x are best determined by dividing the wall and soil over
the heel into rectangles and triangles so the areas (and masses) can be easily computed and
the centroidal locations identified. Then it becomes a simple matter to obtain
(Wc + W8 + P'av)x = Pahy - Ppyp
= Mg - Ppyp
Wc + Ws + P'av
If there is no passive toe resistance (and/or P'av is ignored) the preceding equations are some-
what simplified.

12-6.2 Rotational Stability
In Fig. 12-13 we see that in certain cases a wall can rotate as shown—usually when there
are lower strata that are of poorer quality than the base soil. This failure is similar to a slope
stability analysis using trial circles. These computations can be done by hand. Where several
circles (but all passing through the heel point) are tried for a minimum stability number Nr,
though, the busywork becomes prohibitive; and a computer program (see author's B-22) for
slope stability analysis—adjusted for this type of problem as an option—should be used. This
procedure is illustrated later in Example 12-4.

12-6.3 General Comments on Wall Stability
It is common—particularly for low walls—to use the Rankine earth-pressure coefficients Ka
and Kp (or Table 11-5), because these are somewhat conservative. If the wall angle a of Fig.
11-4 is greater than 90°, consider using the Coulomb equations with S > 0.

Figure 12-13 Wall-soil shear failure may be analyzed by the Swedish-circle method. A "shallow" failure occurs
when base soil fails. A "deep" failure occurs if the poor soil stratum is underlying a better soil, as in the figure.

For stem analysis the friction angle 8 of Fig. Yl-YIa is taken as the slope angle /3 in the
Rankine analysis. The friction angle is taken as some fraction of ^) in a Coulomb analysis,
with 0.670 commonly estimated for a concrete wall formed using plywood or metal forms so
the back face is fairly smooth.
For the overall wall stability of Fig. Yl-YIb the angle /3' may be taken as /3 for the Rank-
ine method, but for the Coulomb analysis take /3 ' = </>. This value then is used to obtain
the horizontal component of Pa as shown. For the vertical friction component Pav resisting
overturning take
Pav = Pahtan<f>r (12-6)
since the 8 angle shown on Fig. \1-Ylb is always soil-to-soil, but the soil is more in a "resid-
ual" than a natural state.
The Rankine value for Kp (or see Table 11-5) is usually used if passive pressure is included.
If there is uncertainty that the full base depth D is effective in resisting via passive pressure,
it is permissible to use a reduced value of D' as
D' = D - potential loss of depth
The potential loss of depth may be to the top of the base or perhaps the top 0.3+ m, de-
pending on designer assessment of how much soil will remain in place over the toe. Note that
some of this soil is backfill, which must be carefully compacted when it is being replaced.
Otherwise full passive pressure resistance may n6t develop until the wall has slipped so far
forward that it has "failed."
12-6.4 Base Key
Where sufficient sliding stability is not possible—usually for walls with large H—a base key,
as illustrated in Fig. 12-14, has been used. There are different opinions on the best location
for a key and on its value. It was common practice to put the key beneath the stem as in Fig.
12-14a, until it was noted that the conditions of Fig. Yl-XAb were possible. This approach
was convenient from the view of simply extending the stem reinforcement through the base
and into the key. Later it became apparent that the key was more effective located as in Fig.
12- 14c and, if one must use a key, this location is recommended. The increase in H by the
key depth may null its effect.
12-6.5 Wall Tilt
Concrete retaining walls have a tendency to tilt forward because of the lateral earth pressure
(Fig. 12-15«), but they can also tilt from base slab rotation caused by differential settlement.
Occasionally the base soil is of poor quality and with placement of sufficient backfill (typi-
cally, the approach fill at a bridge abutment) the backfill pressure produces a heel settlement
that is greater than at the toe. This difference causes the wall to tilt into the backfill as shown
in Fig. 12-156.
If the Rankine active earth pressure is to form, it is necessary that the wall tilt forward as
noted in Sec. 11-2. A wall with a forward tilt does not give an observer much confidence in
its safety, regardless of stability numbers. Unless the wall has a front batter, however, it is
difficult for it to tilt forward—even a small amount—without the tilt being noticeable. It may
be possible to reduce the tilt by overdesigning the stem—say, use K0 instead of Ka pressures
and raise the location of the resultant. When one makes this choice, use a finite-element
program such as your B-5 to check the wall movements. Although this type of analysis may
not be completely accurate, there is currently no better way of estimating wall tilt.

12-6.6 Other Considerations in Retaining Wall Design
When there is a limited space in which to place the wall base slab and the sliding stability
number Ns is too small, what can be done? There are several possible solutions:

1. Look to see if you are using a slab-soil friction angle S that is too small—for concrete
poured on a compacted soil it can be 8 = cf). Are you using any P'av contribution? Can
you?
2. Consider placing the base slab deeper into the ground. At the least, you gain some addi-
tional passive resistance.
3. Consider using short piles, on the order of 2 to 2.5 m in length, spaced about 1.5 to 2.0 m
along the wall length. These would be for shear, i.e., laterally loaded.
4. Consider improving the base soil by adding lime or cement to a depth of 0.3+ m just
beneath the base.
5. Consider sloping the base, but keep in mind that this is not much different from using a
heel key. Considerable hand work may be needed to obtain the soil slope, and then there
is a question of whether to maintain the top of the base horizontal or slope both the top and
bottom. You may get about the same effect by increasing the base-to-soil S angle 1 or 2°.
6. Sloping the heel as shown in Fig. 12-16 has been suggested. This solution looks elegant
until one studies it in depth. What this configuration hopes to accomplish is a reduction in
lateral pressure—the percentage being

R = 100.0 - & ) 100 (%)

Note that because of the natural minimum energy law a soil wedge will form either as
A'CD' or as BCDA. A1CD' is the Rankine wedge, so if this forms the heel slope BA is
an unnecessary expense.
If the wedge BCDA forms, the net gain (or loss) is trivial. We can obtain the value
from plotting two force diagrams—one for wedge ACD, which is in combination with
the force diagram from block BCCA as done in the inset of Fig. 12-16.
Keep in mind that if this slope is deemed necessary, the reason is that the base slab is
narrow to begin with. By being narrow, the overturning moment from P^ may tend to lift
the heel away from the underlying soil, so the value of R2 may be close to zero. If the heel
slope compresses the soil, friction may be so large that wedge A'CD' is certain to form.
Walls built using this procedure may be standing but likely have a lower than intended
SF. Their current safety status may also be due to some initial overdesign.
7. It has been suggested that for high walls Fig. 12-17 is a possible solution—that is, use
"relief shelves." This solution has some hidden traps. For example, the soil must be well
compacted up to the relief shelf, the shelf constructed, soil placed and compacted, etc. In
theory the vertical pressure on the shelf and the lateral pressure on the wall are as shown.
We can see that the horizontal active pressure resultant Pah is much less than for a top-
down pressure profile—at least for the stem.
What is difficult to anticipate is the amount of consolidation that will occur beneath the
shelves—and it will—regardless of the state of the compaction. This tends to cantilever
the shelves down, shown as dashed lines in the pressure profile diagram. When this occurs,
either the shelf breaks off or the wall above tends to move into the backfill and develop

passive pressure. The wall therefore must be well reinforced on both faces and of sufficient
thickness to carry this unanticipated shear and moment.
There is also the possibility of a Rankine wedge forming on line GH (overall wall
stability). In this case the relief shelves have only increased the design complexity of the
project.
12-7 WALLJOINTS
Current practice is to provide vertical contraction joints at intervals of about 8 to 12 m. These
are formed by placing narrow vertical strips on the outer stem face form so that a vertical
groove is developed when the concrete hardens. The groove produces a plane of weakness
to locate tension cracks (so they are less obvious) from tensile stresses developing as the
concrete sets (cures) or from contraction in temperature extremes.
Joints between successive pours are not currently identified—the new concrete is simply
poured over the old (usually the previous day's pour) and the wall continued. When the forms
are stripped, any obvious discontinuities are removed in the wall finishing operation.

of 16 to 25 m. Current practice discourages5 their use, since they require a neat vertical joint

filled with an asphaltic spacer and dowels through the joint with the ends on one side greased
or sheathed to allow expansion/contraction.
Current thinking is that with the large shear resistance to expansion/contraction on the
back face from the lateral pressure + the friction resistance of the base, the joint is useless.
Also, whereas joints are common for concrete roads, these are exposed to more sunlight than
a wall, which (at most) would be exposed for only about half a day.

12-8 WALLDRAINAGE
It was pointed out in Chap. 11 that it is preferable to provide backfill drainage rather than to
design the wall for the large lateral pressure that results from a saturated backfill.

Backfill


Drainage can be accomplished by providing a free-draining material at the back face (or
entire Rankine zone) and longitudinal collector drains along the back face as in Fig. 12-18a.
At intervals drain pipes (about 75 to 100 mm in diameter) called weep holes are run through
the wall to carry away the accumulated water from the horizontal collector pipe, unless it
can discharge naturally from one end of the wall. Where the base is well into the ground, it
may only be practical to use weep holes close to the ground surface in front of the wall, to
drain the backfill to that level. Below this level the ground would saturate on both sides; the
hydrostatic pressure would cancel and not be highly objectionable.
A major problem with any drainage system is to provide some kind of filter material around
the entrance on the backfill side so loss of fines does not occur. One may use a porous geotex-
tile wick material along the vertical face of the wall and over the weep holes (with or without
a granular backfilled zone). This allows water to penetrate the geotextile and travel vertically
(and horizontally) to the weep holes while preventing the large loss of backfill fines shown
in Fig. 12-186.
If a geotextile is not used, one should use very coarse gravel in the vicinity of the weep
holes (and around any horizontal collector drain) that gradually grades to the backfill sieve
size. If only a medium coarse sand is used, it will nearly always wash through the weep holes
after several heavy rains. Here again, project inspection is critical, for it is much easier (and
cheaper) for the builder simply to dump sand behind the wall with little regard that it will
leach through the weep holes later than to locate the weep holes, backfill around them with
gravel, then dump the sand. For sand backfill and a water source, a common "compaction"
procedure is to saturate the sand until there is visible surface water. This can be done only if
the saturation water does not damage the surrounding soil.

12-9 SOIL PROPERTIES FOR RETAINING WALLS
It is evident that we will need the backfill parameters y and (f> for the earth-pressure compu-
tation. It is implicit that in at least a limited zone behind the wall a granular backfill will be
used.
As previously noted, we may use K0 for all or part of the wall—especially if the backfill
zone is limited and/or we use compaction equipment on clayey backfill. Here K0 is computed
using Eq. (2-18a):
K0 = 1 -sin<£ (2-18a)
Unless the backfill soil parameters are provided by the geotechnical consultant it is common
to estimate them conservatively as follows:
0 = 30 to 36° (usually 32 to 34°)
y = 16.5 to 17.5 kN/m3 (105 to 110 lb/ft3)
One should have values of $, y, and cohesion c for the original ground (where it will be
excavated vertically to make space for a wall). Direct shear or direct simple shear (DSS)
tests on good-quality tube samples provide the best soil parameters, since a retaining wall
is a plane strain case. Most testing is triaxial (if any is done) and either unconsolidated or
consolidated-undrained. Many test laboratories do not have DSS test equipment. The base
soil plane strain parameters of (/>, y, and cohesion c must be obtained (or estimated) so that
sliding stability and bearing capacity can be computed.

It is common practice, however, to obtain su = qjl for any cohesive soil, where qu is
obtained as outlined in Chap. 3 from SPT data and using either compression machine testing
or a pocket penetrometer (or in combination).
This type of soil data has a history of success. The principal deficiencies (wall failures)
derive from inadequate drainage of the backfill zone, so that a large hydrostatic pressure de-
velops, and/or from excessive saturation of the base soil, so that su reduces from the softening
that occurs when a cohesive soil becomes saturated.

12-10 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS IN CONCRETE
RETAINING WALL DESIGN
Retaining walls may be designed for the active soil pressure case when the wall is sufficiently
flexible that it will rotate enough to allow the active earth-pressure wedge to form. In other
cases, the wall may be somewhat overdesigned where the backfill is in a limited zone and/or
compaction pressures may develop. Several methods have been presented in Chap. 11 and in
this chapter for taking into account pressures in excess of the active value.
There is some opinion that the active earth pressure is appropriate for all walls since a
failure of the stem always involves sufficient movement to initiate the active earth-pressure
wedge. More conservative opinion, however, holds that this may not always be the case—
particularly for walls where the backfill zone is limited as shown in Fig. \\-\2b. Bear in mind
that if a wall is designed for an active pressure and the soil becomes saturated, the additional
hydrostatic lateral pressure may shear the stem6—or produce excessive sliding.
Figure 11-126 is a common situation for basement walls and some bridge abutments. In
neither of these cases do we want the excessive deflections necessary to produce active earth
pressure to occur.
In passing, note that even in cohesionless soils where the Rankine active wedge can form,
it is likely to do so only in the upper part of the wall; the lower (approximately one-fourth)
part is somewhat restrained by the base and other factors so that the Rankine wedge does
not fully form. Large-scale walls instrumented to record pressure, as reported by Coyle et al.
(1972) and Prescott et al. (1973) consistently measured earth pressures in the lower part of
the wall that were higher than either the Rankine or Coulomb active values.
Some pressure measurements were as much as 2.5 times the "theoretical" values. In a
number of cases the "average" wall force was reasonably close to the "active" value but the
location of the resultant seemed to be consistently higher—on the order of 0.4 to 0.45// (in-
stead of///3). An extensive survey of compaction-induced pressures and methods for analysis
is given by Ingold (1979).
Finally, note that if a retaining wall is backfilled with a cohesive material and compacted,
very high lateral pressures will be developed. These are not predictable either by the Rankine
or Coulomb earth-pressure equations or by Eq. (2-55) or the like. Clayton et al. (1991) suggest
that in compacted clay fills the lateral pressure at the end of backfilling is likely to be on the
order of 0.2sM for intermediate and 0.4^ for highly plastic clays, with some reduction with
elapsed time. You might use the following:

6Hydrostatic pressure does not decrease with wall translation, and the active pressure is a limiting soil state.


Clay Ip9 %

Intermediate plasticity 20 to 35
Highly plastic > 35

When one is using a clay backfill, swelling is less likely, according to the Clayton et al.
study, if Ip < 30. For Ip < 40 swelling could be avoided by using a compaction moisture
content greater than the OMC. In any case many existing walls have been constructed using
cohesive backfills.

12-11 ALLOWABLE BEARING CAPACITY
Stability of the base against a bearing-capacity failure is achieved by using a suitable safety
factor with the computed ultimate bearing capacity, where the safety factor is usually taken
as 2.0 for granular soil and 3.0 for cohesive soil.
The allowable soil pressure can be computed using the Hansen bearing-capacity equation
(from Table 4-1) with the shape factors deleted:
<2\iit = cNcdcic + yDNqdqiq + \yB'Nyiy
where d\ = depth factors and U = inclination factors, which are based on the load inclination
since there is both a vertical and horizontal load. It is suggested to use the Hansen inclination
factors of Table 4-5b with an exponent of a\ = 2 for iq and c*2 = 3 for iy. This approach is
approximately the same as using the Vesic exponent m (and m + 1) for the inclination factors
in that table. These reduced exponents can be somewhat justified on the basis that the wall
footing often has a considerable depth of embedment and the earth pressure in front of the
wall stem is neglected in computing the horizontal force Pah = H in the equations for the
inclination factors. The shape factors are not used since the wall footing is classified as a
strip, so that all st — 1.
The above bearing-capacity equation computes the rectangular bearing-capacity profile as
given in Fig. 4-4a and Fig. 12-12a, and for consistency the base design should use that profile
(the L dimension = 1 unit). The base width B should be such that Jc < B/3 of Fig. Yl-YIb so
that the toe pressure is not excessive for any type of base soil pressure profile.
The base depth D must place the footing below topsoil and frost depth. It also must be
deep enough to be stable against scour/erosion and to allow adequate development of bearing
capacity and sliding resistance.
When the soil is of low bearing capacity and/or it is not practical to use a larger base slab,
it will be necessary to use a pile foundation to support the base slab, which in turn supports
the wall. For bridge abutments this is a common procedure used to control settlements at the
junction of the approach fill and the bridge deck.

12-12 WALL SETTLEMENTS
Settlements are usually finished by the time a wall has been completed on granular base soil.
If the base soil is a saturated, cohesive material (or there is a deeper layer of cohesive soil in
the stress influence zone) consolidation settlements will occur over time. In any of these cases


there may be differential settlements between the toe and heel if there is a large difference in
pressure between the two locations.
Heel settlement larger than the toe occurs primarily when there is a substantial increase in
backfill, e.g., in the backfill zones of Figs. W-Ha, b, and d and Fig. 12-156, which represents
an increase in load on the soil. If this zone has been excavated, the wall built, and then soil
replaced, there will be very little settlement because the replacement of soil with concrete
in the wall volume represents only a small increase in load. A new soil pressure resulting
from perhaps 2 to 3 m of backfill that did not previously exist is an increase that can produce
substantial long-term settlements in cohesive soils and at least some settlement (immediate)
in cohesionless soils.
A more critical situation, however, occurs where the soil is excavated for the footing using
power equipment and the rough base is then covered with a thin layer of sand, raked smooth,
and the footing poured. This is almost certain to cause settlements and cracks in the wall as
in Fig. 12-19 (also in Fig. 12-186)—often shortly after it is completed. Settlement cracks in
the wall can be nearly eliminated with adequate construction inspection and by having and
enforcing compaction specifications before the base slab is poured.
Toe settlements are more difficult to control since they are produced (assuming adequate
base compaction) by lateral soil pressure. They can be somewhat hidden by using a batter on
the front face of the wall. They can be somewhat controlled by using a wider base slab so the
base pressure is reduced (but the bearing stresses will penetrate further into the ground). If
toe settlements are to be eliminated, one can strengthen the soil to a depth using sand piles,
rock columns, grouting, or structural piles.

Figure 12-19 Settlement cracks. Three vertical cracks about 1.5 m apart in this wall section were caused by
placing base on loose soil. Sidewalk joints are on 1.5 m spacing. Wall cracks developed about 1 week after forms
were stripped. Upper level supports a small parking lot. This is not the wall designed in Example 12-6.


12-13 RETAINING WALLS OF VARYING HEIGHT;
ABUTMENTS AND WINGWALLS
Seldom does a long retaining wall have constant height except possibly when used in hy-
draulic structures. In cold climates with a deep frost depth there may be as much of the wall
below ground as above, or even more.
Conventional wall analysis considers a constant height on a strip of unit width. If the wall
is long, two or three typical sections with different heights but using the same stem thick-
ness might be analyzed for reinforcing bar changes. In construction the same stem thickness
is used; the amount of reinforcing bars projecting out of the base slab for dowels may be
left constant to the next section analyzed and then either the size or number reduced (or not
reduced but not spliced since the wall is shorter). Where welded wire fabric is used for re-
inforcement it is usually just cut to a shorter height, because that is usually less costly than
having a number of different fabrics on site to sort through.
Where the wall varies in height, both nonplane strain conditions and wall twist are assumed
to develop. For the usual conditions of a change in wall height developed gradually, using
a uniform slope, the wall is overdesigned sufficiently to absorb the twist both because the
wall thickness is held constant and because the temperature and shrinkage (T and S) steel
requirements in the stem will carry some twist moment. Where abrupt changes in wall height
occur, one probably should increase the T and S steel in the transition zone—perhaps 10 to
25 percent (depending on the importance factor for the site).
Abutments and wingwalls are commonly used for bridge structures. There is at present
little guidance on the design of these members. The principal design considerations in
AASHTO (1990) Sec. 3-20 are to use an earth pressure based on an equivalent fluid (yKa)
of not less than 4.75 kN/m3 (30 pcf). The design requirements are given in AASHTO Sec.
7-4:

1. Abutments shall be designed to withstand the earth pressure of AASHTO Sec. 3-20.
2. Abutments shall be designed to be safe against overturning about the toe of the footing
and against sliding on the base, and for bearing capacity.
3. The backfill vertically over the base can be considered a part of the effective weight of the
abutment.

For wingwalls the requirements are these:

1. They shall be of sufficient length to retain the roadway embankment.
2. Reinforcing bars or suitable rolled sections shall be spaced across the junction between
wingwalls and abutments to tie them together. The bars will be extended sufficiently to
develop bond for the bar strength and vary in length so that a plane of weakness is not
formed vertically.
From a careful study of the AASHTO specifications we see that abutment and wingwalls
are designed as cantilever (or gravity) retaining walls with account taken in the abutment for
the bridge seat (see Fig. 12-9/), which may apply a horizontal thrust, a vertical weight, and
top moment (if the bearing device is not in the stem axis) in addition to the lateral earth pres-
sure. There may be some question of how much design force (shear, tension, and moment) is


produced at the junction of the wingwall and abutment; however, the AASHTO specification
further states (sec. 7.4.3.2):

If bars are not used, an expansion joint shall be provided and the wing wall shall be keyed into
the body of the abutment.

From this it appears that the specification writers assume that there is negligible force transfer.
From inspection of Fig. 12-20 we see that if the walls carry the forces Pab and Pw w there
is in fact little for the junction to carry, and shrinkage and temperature (or some similar ap-
proximation) reinforcement would be sufficient.
The only item in the design that appears not to be conservative is the "equivalent fluid"
value of 4.75 kN/m3. In the limited backfill zone defined by an abutment and wingwalls (that
is, a compacted zone), it would appear that the equivalent fluid should be a minimum of 8 to
12 kN/m3. For a granular soil of unit weight y = 17.30 kN/m3 (110 pcf) and an equivalent
fluid of 4.75 kN/m3 the active earth-pressure coefficient can be backcomputed as
Ka = 4.75/17.30 = 0.275
The corresponding <f> angle is <£ *=» 34.7°. For this <f> angle
K0 = 1 - sin 34.7° = 0.431
The resulting "equivalent fluid" = 17.30(0.431) = 7.46 kN/m3. Since many abutment
fills are clayey and are compacted—often in a fairly limited zone—it would appear that the

AASHTO procedure would be somewhat unsafe were it not that rather large load factors are
used elsewhere in the design.

12-14 COUNTERFORT RETAINING WALLS
Prior to reinforced earth, when the cantilever retaining wall reached a height of about 7 m,
it became economical to consider a counterfort wall (Fig. 12-9c). There may be a rare occa-
sion where this is still a practical (but not an economical) solution, so the basic elements of
counterfort wall design are presented. Note in Fig. \2-9c that if the counterforts are in front
of the wall (exposed), the structure is a buttressed wall.
The counterfort wall base dimensions tend to range from 0.5 to OJH as for the cantilever
wall, and the toe and heel dimensions similarly as shown on Fig. 12-11. Counterfort spacings
(Fig. 12-21) are commonly on the order of 0.3 to 0.5//, and the counterforts are on the order
of 300 mm thick, so reinforcement (as a T beam) can be placed with 70 mm clear cover on
each side. The trial wall slab (or stem) dimensions may be approximated as for the cantilever
stem.
The design proceeds by selecting trial dimensions and making a cantilever retaining wall-
type analysis for overturning, sliding, and bearing capacity. When these proportions are ap-
proximately adequate, the design may proceed.
The counterfort wall is at least partially a plate fixed on three edges, and one may approx-
imate a solution in that manner. In fact, modern practice and wide availability of computers
and computer programs (such as FADMAT on your diskette) almost mandate this method of
analysis, especially when taking into account that a counterfort wall is very costly.
For use in program FADMAT (and for other similar computer programs) grid the mat as a
plate fixed on three edges as shown in Fig. 12-21. Input is the active lateral pressure converted

to nodal forces. There is no resisting soil force but, by using the boundary conditions of no
translation at the fixed nodes, structural stability is obtained. Also, inspect the grid and input
select boundary conditions of zero rotation for vertical NP along the axis of symmetry and for
both horizontal and vertical NP at the fixed edges. From the element output one can obtain
the shear at the node points for a wide-beam type of analysis to check the stem thickness;
and from the moments at the nodes one can select the necessary stem reinforcement. At this
stage several trials may be necessary to somewhat optimize the stem thickness.
From the shears at the counterfort nodes one can design the reinforcement to attach the
counterfort to the wall.
A similar plate-fixed-on-three-edges analysis can be done for the heel (or toe, if a buttress-
type wall). The free toe (or heel) is similar to the cantilever retaining wall and does not require
a computer analysis.
The bearing capacity is computed as for a regular cantilever retaining wall.
The counterforts are analyzed as T beams to provide sufficient reinforcement to carry
the tension between counterfort and heel and between stem and counterfort. For buttressed
walls the counterfort (or buttress) is in compression and only requires sufficient dowels to
avoid separation of components. The tensions are obtained from the node shears based on the
elements framing into the node.

12-15 BASEMENT OR FOUNDATION WALLS;
WALLS FOR RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION
Walls for building foundations, and basement walls for both residential construction and
larger structures, require the same design considerations. It is very common (but certainly
not recommended) for the basement walls of residential dwellings to be backfilled with ex-
cavated earth (also construction debris and anything else lying on the earth piled around the
wall and left for backfill) with little regard to its quality. It is pushed into the b zone cavity
(see Fig. \\-\2b) behind the wall using a front-end loader or the like and seldom is com-
pacted. Compaction, except using hand equipment, would be difficult because the b zone is
seldom over 0.6 m and because unreinforced concrete block and mortar walls are often used.
It is also not unusual in these cases after an intense rain to observe props against the walls
(still under construction) to keep them from caving—and sometimes they do; and sometimes
several years after construction. Collapse would not be a problem if

1. A perimeter drain has been installed; and
2. A granular, freely draining material is used for backfill. A perimeter drain is of dimin-
ished value if the backfill is not freely draining—but it will usually drain enough water to
maintain a dry basement.
A propped wall will always have a bulged region, since propping does not start until the
wall starts to show distress. After the building is finished and the site landscaped so that
surface water drains away from the structure, these wall problems usually stop.
The tops of these walls are usually restrained from lateral movement by attachment to
the superstructure floor, so earth pressures larger than active are likely. If the floors are
not strongly attached to the basement walls, the building may shift off of the foundation in a


high wind or during a mild earthquake. Since basement walls for residential construction are
seldom over 2.5 m high, earth pressures larger than the active value can usually be tolerated.
Backfill for residential basement walls should be carefully placed and of good quality and
preferably granular. The wall should be provided with a perimeter drain placed either on the
wall footing or in the wall footing trench. This type of construction will nearly always ensure
a dry basement and is more economical than later having to dry the basement by excavating
and replacing the fill with quality material and/or installing a perimeter drain.
A perimeter drain is especially important when there is an underground aquifer in which
the ground water table varies with rainfall and the basement floor can intercept the GWT. If
there is the potential for a GWT-basement interception it is good practice for both residental
and commercial construction to grade the subsoil with a slope to one corner of the building,
place a 150-mm maximum depth horizontal granular layer on this, compact it, and pour the
floor. Later, if the basement becomes wet, a sump hole can be dug in the low corner to drain the
subsoil around the building. This is seldom done unless water appears in the subsoil during
construction.
In closing this section, observe that all of these suggested practices would substantially
(but not visibly) increase the quality of the construction. Their implementation should seldom
increase building costs over 1 to 2 percent, and despite any claims to the contrary, no builder
can produce a building estimate any closer than this.

Since the ACI318- Alternate Design Method (ADM) is being used to design retaining walls,
select elements will be presented in this section for the reader not familiar with the procedure.
For this method the most used design stresses are given in Table 12-1.

used values of k and j so these stress ratios do not have to be computed for each design.

12-17 CANTILEVER RETAINING WALL EXAMPLES
The several concepts discussed will now be incorporated into three illustrative examples.

Rotational Stability
This example illustrates a general method to analyze the rotational stability of a wall where
a base failure that is not identified by bearing capacity may occur. The procedure makes use
of the slope stability analysis as given in most introductory courses in geotechnical engineer-
ing. If your textbook does not give the procedure, see Bowles (1984) Chap. 16. Because of
the large amount of busywork it is preferable to use a slope stability computer program7 as
follows:

1. Draw the wall-soil system and soil layers to a convenient (and fairly large) scale.
2. Compute all the forces acting against the vertical plane through the heel point and their
moment arms with respect to the trial circle center. There is usually only Pa, but this may
be at a slope to the horizontal.
3. Divide the wall and all contributing backfill zones into geometric shapes so that you
can easily compute their weights and moment arms with respect to the toe. Find the total

weight and its location x' from the toe. This weight will be used as a surcharge on a small
width (say 0.3 m) so that it is seen as essentially a "point" load. This weight and its location
will replace the wall just as the active earth force replaces the backfill outside the "virtual
wall" plane through the heel. You cannot combine the lateral and vertical forces for a
resultant x as in Fig. Yl-YIb, but you can ignore any Pp lateral force on the toe depth,
since that will be internal to the circle boundaries.
4. With most computer programs the next step is to identify the several lines that make up
the slope (not wall) geometry, identify the several soils, and identify which lines enclose
the several soils. For this you do not need a scaled drawing.
5. Number the lines and line ends in the order required by the program. Program B-22 re-
quires that you number the top slope lines in sequence of increasing x coordinate before
numbering the interior lines. It requires the line ends also be numbered in order of increas-
ing x coordinate.
6. Next set the line end coordinates. This step requires consistency but usually you can use
relative values. If the actual y = 120 m, use a relative value of possibly y = 10 m—but
take off 110 m from all other y coordinates as well.
7. Now tentatively locate the several trial circle centers you want to investigate and locate
the entrance coordinates. The entrance coordinates must by definition of this analysis be
taken through the heel point of the wall.
8. After finding the minimum safety factor you will need to revise the wall geometry if Nr =
SF is too small (usually less than 1.5). If after several wall revisions are done the stability
number Nr is still too small, you will have to consider some other solution—perhaps using
piles or soil improvement.

Note that although a cantilever retaining wall is shown for this example, this analysis is
also applicable to a reinforced earth wall.

Example 12-4. The retaining wall shown in Fig. E12-4a overlies a soft clay deposit that may pro-
duce a rotational instability. It is required to determine the minimum Nr (or SF) against this type of
failure. Refer to the figure for soil properties and critical dimensions.

Solution. Since it is necessary to investigate several trial circles the only practical means is to use
a slope stability program. Even with this as an aid a substantial amount of preliminary work is
involved.

1. The wall geometry and soil lines are drawn to approximate scale as in Fig. E12-4#. The wall
is critical, but the remainder is less so. Since all slope stability programs require you to input
lines to define the slope and soil, their end coordinates must be obtained. Scale them from the
drawing, or make up a set of relative values as in Fig. E12-4a. Where two lines intersect, be sure
they have the same input coordinates with a precision of at least 0.01.
2. Number the lines with the outside top lines first; also number line ends and intersections based
on increasing x coordinate. Some of the numbers are shown on Fig. E12-4fl and a table of input
line coordinates is on the output sheet (Fig. E12-4&).
3. The Rankine active earth pressure using Ka = 0.2948 (from program FFACTOR since 33° is
not in Table 11-3) is computed as

4. The two soils are enclosed by lines—the base soil is enclosed by lines 1, 2, 3, and 4. The soft
clay is enclosed by lines 4 and 5 and the effective unit weight y' = 9.44 kN/m3 is used.
Comments. (Refer to output sheets Fig. E12-4Z? following obtained from using program B-22).
1. Line 1 on Fig. E12-4a starts from point 1 at x = 0, y = 6.1 m. The lower two lines have these
features: Line 4 has x = 0.3 m, and line 5 has x = 0.6 m (so we do not encounter problems of
two coordinates with the same x value). Line 1 stops at intersection 4 with x = 20.0 m and y =
6.1m.
2. Line 2 starts at point 4 and ends at 5 (or E) with x = 20.0 m and y = 5.20 m. The vert-
ical distance is 0.9 m and is given a small program-defined (-) slope with the value shown
(0.100 E+11 on Fig. E12-4&) so there is "no divide by zero" error. The slope sign is computed
by the program.
3. Line 3 starts at B and is arbitrarily extended beyond A to x coordinate = 30.0 m and y = 4.90
m. We will locate the wall weight as a surcharge on this line, but we only have to specify the
surcharge Q, the x coordinate at the left where it starts, and the JC coordinate on the right. Here
we used Q = 351.3/0.3 kN/m on a width of 0.3 m. First we had to locate the x coordinate of Q
using the several parts making up the wall and backfill on the heel of Fig. El 2-4«. Note that a
small triangular zone in the toe region is neglected as not being worth the computation effort.

4. Note that the output sheet shows the perpendicular distance to Pa for each trial circle. You can
see after the first three trials the y distance increased 0.3 m (the vertical grid spacing) and another
0.3 m again after the first six trials. This is a small output check and clutters the output sheet
somewhat, but remember, you need all the checks you can get for complicated programs.
The program tabulates data on the several trial circles tried (using a center point grid of nine
points at a spacing of 0.3 m each way starting from the lower left). The minimum SF for nine
trials is found to be 1.7261 and is found at center grid point 2. Refer also to Fig. E12-4c. Note
that the center coordinates for all the nine entrance points used, the trial circle radius (through
the ENTX, ENTY point) and SF are output in a table (Fig. E12-4b). Clearly from this table we
see that the SF is sensitive to the center coordinates.
5. A rough plot is produced on screen, if requested, (a) to check if the lines meet (bad input coor-
dinates) and (b) to see if the minimum trial circle is reasonable. If it were all in the base soil, it
would not be considered a solution. The program has some internal checks to output a large SF
if the circle is below the clay soil (y coordinate < O) or to the left (x coordinate < O).
This plot is reproduced on paper using the <Print Screen> function but is not to scale, since
screen pixels are not well-scaled. To get a scaled drawing, the output can be directed to a disk
file for later use with a plotting program.
The screen plot is particularly useful for more general types of slope analyses where the user
may want to change the entrance coordinates. Here they must always pass through the heel at
point A of Fig. E12-4«, but it is useful here to see if the minimum SF is partly in the clay.
6. The program also outputs the slice location and surcharge data. We see it finds the surcharge on
slice 11 and, with a 0.3-m width, the product of Q X Dl = 1171.0 X 0.3 = 351.299 (351.3 is
input). This result also somewhat clutters the output sheet, but again remember that the more
self-checks are in a program, the higher is the user confidence level. Here the slice number
without the program is of little value, but the remainder shows that the surcharge Q was used. In
the program there is an input switch that allows output of slice locations giving the x coordinate
of each slice (by the way, there are two slices with the same x coordinates at the vertical line) so
one can obtain sufficient data to reproduce the complete trial circle for hand-checking including
slice weights, pore pressure head (if applicable), or any upstream tailwater heads.
One probably should make several more trials to see if the minimum SF = 1.7261 or if a
smaller value can be found that has part of the trial circle in the clay soil.

Retaining Wall Stability
The next example will illustrate the method of analyzing a retaining wall for overturning and
sliding stability. The general stability considerations are shown in Fig. Yl-YIb. The mechan-
ical details involve finding the several weight vectors and moment arms JC,- with respect to
overturning. A substantial amount of busywork is involved and it may be convenient (if you
do not use a computer program) to draw the system to a large scale and measure the required
dimensions.
We note that with several weight vectors, and if the backfill has a /3 angle and the wall
has a batter, the computations become especially involved. A tabulation of data is necessary
so that quantities are not overlooked.


Figure E12-5

Example 12-5. Analyze the retaining wall shown in Fig. E12-5 for overturning and sliding stability.
Note that this wall is backfilled in a limited zone with a cohesive soil. The batter is on the back face,
as used by some transportation departments. Most of the output was obtained from using the author's
computer program B-24. Dimensions shown were optimized by the program to satisfy both strength
and stability requirements (usually wide-beam shear for member thickness and bearing capacity for
dimension B).

Solution,
Step 1. Find the <f>' angle for an equivalent cohesionless soil (see Fig. E12-5&):
q = yHKa-2cjKa = yHK'a
Rankine Ka = 0.361 for <j> = 28° (Table 11-3)
q = 17.95(6.7)(0.361) - 2(19.12)(0.601)
= 43.42 - 22.97 = 20.45 kPa
_ 20.45 _
K* " (6.7)(17.95) ~ a i 7 °
45° - I = 22.42°
0 = 45.16° Use 0' = 45° ^ = 0.171
This value of <f>\ as well as y = 17.95 kN/m3, was used in the computer program.
Step 2. Compute Pa:
Pa = (0.5yH2 + qH)K'a
= [0.5(17.95)(6.7)2 + 23.90(6.7)](0.171)
= 96.28 kN (vs. 20.45 X 3.16/2 = 32.3 kN at y = 3.16/3 = 1.05 m)
Step 3. Compute overturning stability. Set up a table and refer to Fig. E12-4c.
The location of Pa is at j :

$Sum does not include 39.7 kN.
HDoes not include 114.30 kN • m.

The overturning stability number is (and including Pav but using 0.8$)

Step 4. Compute the sliding stability number N5 but do not include Pav. Use base soil parameters
and
c' = 0.67c = 0.67(35.17) = 23.56 kPa
tanS = tan <f> = tan 34° = 0.675
Fr = c'B + Fvten8
= 23.56(2.88) + 296.3(0.675) = 267.86 kN

Step 5. Locate the resultant on the base of the footing. From rigid body statics a moment summation
can be taken at any location. Use the toe, as we already have most of the moments computed, but
do not include Pav:
^ T Af = Mr-Mo = 550.97 - 245.58 = 305.40 kN • m

X = I = ^ = ^ 1 ^ = 1.03 m from toe (> 2.88/3)

e = ~ - X = 1.44 - 1.03 = 0.41 m

£ = ^ = 0.48 > 0.41

Therefore, the resultant is in the middle one-third of base.
Step 6. Compute passive pressure in front of wall and recompute Ns of Step 4. (This calculation is
for illustrative purposes, as N5 is already O.K.)


At least two other ways of computing Ns exist, including 267.86 taken as a (—) driving force and
96.28 considered as a (-) resisting force.

Retaining Wall Design
This example will go through the complete design of a small retaining wall. In general, the
wall design involves tentatively selecting stem and base dimensions, checking them for sta-
bility, and resizing as necessary. Next the allowable bearing capacity is computed, and the
base shear and moments at the stem faces are computed. If the base shear is too large, the base
depth is increased and the problem is recycled. When increasing the base depth, it is best to
reduce the stem height the same amount so the overall wall height remains constant. When
the base thickness is found adequate, the base toe and heel steel requirements are computed.
Since there is much busywork involved, a computer program that finds the required stem
and base dimensions is useful. The program is of even more value if it also produces a rebar
schedule and outputs material quantities.
Figure 12-23 illustrates the critical sections for structural design of the wall elements.
Stem moment steel is on the backfill side of the wall. Since the wall face is exposed, it is
required to place T and S bars longitudinally as shown. The principal toe reinforcement is in
the bottom with one or more bars extended the full base width and the others bent 90° and
extended (a short distance or the full stem height) above the base slab when it is poured so
any needed stem steel bars can be spliced. The principal heel bars are in the top as shown
in the figure and one or more might extend the full base width. Those cut (toe or heel) must
extend at least a distance Dc of the stem or 12*4 beyond the front or back stem faces. Clear
cover of 70 mm (3 in.) is required on all sides for the base. If the stem back face is formed
(and it usually is), a clear cover of 50 mm can be used.
Minimum T and S steel and flexural steel requirements are as follows (see ACI 318-,
Appendix A: Commentary, Articles RA. 1-RA. 1.4):

Grade 300 Grade 400
ify = 40 or 50 ksi) ify > 60 ksi)
T and S 0.002 0.0018
Flexural \Alfy (MPa) 200//, (psi)
Alternative A's = 1.33A5

The preceding ratios are multiplied by the gross concrete area (Ag = full thickness including
clear cover X width); the one-third increase in computed steel area As is self-explanatory.
Longitudinal T and S steel is always required in the stem but may be optional for the
base slab, which is covered with soil. Give consideration to its use in the base slab for some
longitudinal settlement crack control.

Figure 12-23 Critical sections for retaining wall design. Use the differential equations shown for stem shear and
moment. Also use these equations if a linear variable base pressure diagram is used. The rectangular base pressure
diagram shown is preferred and is consistent with the method used to obtain the allowable bearing capacity.
With high walls it is a common practice to cut the stem bars (cutoff points) when the stem
moment is small enough that the bar(s) are no longer needed or the diameter(s) can be reduced
to save steel weight, since the moment in the upper half of the stem is quite low. For small
walls the extra design and labor costs for cutting and splicing may far outweigh the savings
in material.

Example 12-6. Design the retaining wall of Fig. E12-6a to provide lateral support for an existing
parking lot adjacent to a new sidewalk in a road-widening project. The wall height will range from
about 0.3 to 1.7 m above the sidewalk grade in the required 92.2 m of wall length. For frost and
bearing the base will be placed at D = 1.22 m. A typical section appears in Fig. E12-6a, which
also displays the ground before and after the wall is built.
We will generally follow the ACI specifications; AASHTO specifications are similar, but allow-
able stresses are 10 to 15 percent lower (more conservative) because of the additional environment
exposure.
Other information. We will specify granular backfill in the limited zone over the heel as shown,
which will be compacted to 7 = 17.30 kN/m3 and an estimated 4> = 36°. The original soil will
be excavated 50 mm below the footing grade, and the resultant space will be backfilled with 65
mm of granular soil (as in backfill) that is then compacted to grade prior to pouring the footing. It
is assumed in the stability analysis, however, that the footing is on clay, for the sand will probably
become well mixed with the site soil from using equipment for excavation and from spreading and
compacting.
One end of the wall exits in such a manner that a longitudinal drain pipe can be used for drainage;
however, a drain is optional since the backfill is paved.

With this background and the given soil data, several trial computer runs are made using the
largest wall height (of 2.44 m) to obtain the wall dimensions shown on Fig. E12-6a. These data
seem reasonable and will be used in the design steps following to illustrate the general procedure
without having to iterate dimensions. In actual practice, of course, the computer output sheets would
be checked for input and spot-checked for output and the data then provided either to a draftsperson
or to a plot routine for plotting.

Solution. The initial design includes the following considerations:

1. Use a fictitious surcharge of 12 kPa to partially model the parking lot pavement and wheel loads
in the proximity of the parking curb to the wall.
2. Ignore the guard rail. Its mass per meter is negligible and would only occasionally have a lateral
load from persons leaning against it. Guard rail force contributions will be somewhat accounted
for by using a larger earth-pressure coefficient.
3. Use an earth-pressure coefficient of Ka = K0 = 1 — sin <f> for the reasons in the preceding item
and to account for compaction-induced lateral pressures and the probability that a Rankine active
wedge will not form in the limited backfill zone. This gives
Ka = I- sin 36° = 0.412
The Rankine Ka from Table 11-3 is 0.260.
4. We will arbitrarily use a wall of constant thickness to save on forming costs. The wall has a
variable height ranging from about 1.07 to 2.44 m, so tilt is not so likely as for a much higher
wall. Figure E12-6a shows that a substantial amount of the wall height is effectively embedded.


5. We will not specify the particular reinforcing bars but rather specify the amounts and let the
contractor elect whether to use rebars or welded wire fabric.
6. Use /c' = 21 MPa and fy = 400 MPa. Most transportation departments do not allow using /c'
as low as 21 MPa because of the hostile environment, but this concrete strength is acceptable
here. For the Alternate Design Method (ADM) these choices give working stresses of
fc = 0.45/; = 0.45(21) = 9.45MPa (945OkPa) (flexural)

vc = ^ p = ^ - = 0.417 MPa (417 kPa) (wide-beam shear)
/, = 170 MPa (see Table 12-1)
Also k = 0.360; j = 0.880; and n = 10 (see Table 12-2).

We will now proceed to analyze the wall.
Step 1. Using earth pressure principles of Chap. 11, obtain the vertical stem pressure profile of the
wall as
q = fe + yz)Ka
= (12.0 + 17.30z)(0.412)
At top: q = (12.0 + 17.30 X 0.0)(0.412) = 4.94 kPa
At base: q = (12.0 + 17.30 X 2.44)(0.412) = 22.34 kPa
The total lateral wall force is the area of the pressure diagram,

These data are summarized on Fig. E12-6Z?.
Since we will use a constant amount of reinforcing steel for moment based on the largest H it is
only necessary to investigate the stem base. For high walls it would be worthwhile to investigate
other points and perhaps use cutoff points at about H/A intervals vertically. (Computer program B-24
checks the 0.1 points.)
Step 2. Using the shear V and moment M from step 1 check wide-beam shear at the stem base and
find the amount of vertical reinforcement per meter of wall length.
Take 50 mm of clear cover and about 20-mm diameter reinforcing bars; the stem depth d =
D - clear cover - bar diameter/2 = 230 - 50 - 10 = 170 mm.
Allowable Va = 170(417)/1000 = 70.9 kN » 33.28 (O.K.)
Check shear friction since the wall is built after the base has been poured and partially cured.
Shear friction is governed by ACI 318- Art. 11-7-5 with a 55 percent reduction for using the ADM
method (use </> = 0.85):


Figure E12-6&

From this computation it would appear that shear friction seldom controls except possibly for a very
high wall with a thin stem. The stem appears somewhat overdesigned, but we will use this wall
thickness because it is not difficult to construct the formwork, and there is adequate space to place
the reinforcement and necessary top width to secure the guard railing adequately.
The area of reinforcement/meter of wall is computed using the equations shown on Fig. 12-22.
The determination is quite simple when d is known as here:

b^p-fcjd = M = AJJd
Taking d = 0.170 m and j = 0.880, we obtain
A5(IlO X 1OOO)(O.88O X 0.170) = 31.98 kN • m

The minimum for flexure = \A/fy = 1.4/400 = 0.0035.
As,min = 0.0035Ag = 0.0035(1000 X 230) = 805 mm2/m < 1257
For T and S we have
AStTS = 0.0018(Ag) = 0.0018(1000 X 230) = 414mm2/m < 1257
Let us summarize:
Vertical stem reinforcement requires 1257 mm2/m.
Longitudinal stem T and S requires 414 mm2/m.
We have a "balanced" design for the stem.


If we were selecting reinforcing bars (using the table inside the front cover of this text), we would
use four No. 20, giving 4 X 300 = 1200 « 1257 (about 5 percent overstressed) and for longitudinal
T and S use four No. 10 bars per meter, giving 4 X 100 = 400 « 414 (about 3 percent under). The
stem bars require an embedment of at least dhase of base (12 X 20 = 240 < dhase). One would likely
either use some toe steel bent up for dowels or bend the stem steel 90° to wire to the toe bars.
Step 3. Check wall stability for overturning and sliding and that the resultant R is in the middle third
of base width B. For these computations refer to Fig. Yl-YIb but use dimensions from Fig. E12-5«.

a. First we must compute the active earth pressure at the heel through line ba of Fig. Yl-YIb, except
here the backfill slope angle /3 = 0°. Compute the following:
H = 2.44 + 0.46 = 2.90 m
Lateral pressure qiOp = 4.94 kPa (as for stem)
Lateral pressure ^base = (12. + 17.30 X 2.9)0.412 = 25.61 kPa
Horizontal force = Pa = 4 9 4 + 2 5 - 6 1 x 2.9 = 44.30 kN/m

Find y a^ for stem using Eq. (11-14):
= 29 (3X12.0+17.3X2.9) =
y 3 (2 X 12.0 + 17.3 X 2.9)
To compute the resultant vertical force we will divide the wall geometry into rectangles since
the stem has a different y from the soil, etc. It is convenient to use Table E12-6, where the
parts are labeled, weights computed, moment arms given, etc. For this, first observe that the soil
weight Ws includes the 12 kPa surcharge. Also take yc = 23.6 kN/m3.

TABLE E12-6

Ws 1.21(12 + 17.30 X 2.44) = 65.59 1.375 90.18
Stem 23.6(0.23X2.44) = 13.24 0.655 8.67
Base slab 23.6(0.46)(l.98) = 21.49 0.99 21.28

P'av = 33.28 tan (0.8 X 36) =(18.30) 1.98 (36.23)
X Wt = 100.32kN X M r = 156.36 kN • m/m

b. Compute the overturning stability:
Overturning moment M0 = Pay = 44.30 X 1.123 = 49.75 kN/m
The resisting moment Mr (includes P'av of 36.23) is the sum shown in Table E12-6.
Stability number N0 = ^f- = 1J56'36 = 3.14 > 1.5 (O.K.)


c. Now check that the location of the resultant R on base is inside the middle third. The net over-
turning moment (excluding any passive pressure and friction P'av on the vertical plane through
the heel) is:
Mnet = Mr-M0 = 156.36 - 36.23 - 49.75 = 70.38 kN • m/m
*= nr = mk = a 7 0 r n f r o m t o e (> 1 ^ )
e = B/2-x = 1.98/2 - 0.70 = 0.29 m
B/6 = 1.98/6 = 0.33 > 0.29 so resultant is in middle 1/3
d. Compute the sliding stability (we needed to compute the eccentricity e so the effective base
width B' can be computed). For sliding, the resistance is
Fr = R tan 8 + caB' + Pp
From soil data 8 = 0°. Take ca = 0.7c = 0.7 X 120 = 84.0 kPa. Do not use Pp unless
necessary. So
Fr = 84(1.98 - 2 X 0.29) = 117.60 kN
The resulting sliding stability number is
Ns = T
a

 = W = 2 - 6 5 > L 5 ( O K )
We do not need any passive pressure, but if it were used we could probably use the full embed-
ment depth but not include the sidewalk as a surcharge (it may need future repairs).
Let us summarize:
N0 = 3.14 Ns = 2.65
Eccentricity e = 0.29 m

Step 4. Compute bearing capacity. Use the Hansen bearing-capacity equation with all shape factors
,S1- = 1.0; there will be depth dt and inclination factors it. Since </> = 0 for base soil, we will use the
modified equation:
4uit = cNc(l +d'c- i'c) + qNgdgig
Here Nc = 5.14 and Nq = 1.0 from Table 4-4. Compute factors as follows (ca = 84.0 kPa);
0 . 4 D _ 0.4X1.22 _

For (/> = 0°, dq = iq = 1.0. Substituting, we find
^uit = 120(5.14)(1.000 + 0.246 - 0.105) + 17.30(1.22)(l)(l)
= 724.9 kPa
For a cohesive soil using SF = 3.0 gives the allowable soil pressure as


This wall design is now substantially completed.
Step 5. Find the reinforcing needed for the toe and heel. For this refer to Fig. E12-6c.
For the toe (neglect backfill soil over the toe as being conservative) the net soil pressure is
4net = 71.7 - 0.46(23.6) = 60.8 kPa
The shear force at the stem face (toe distance = 0.54 m) is
Vtoe = 60.8(0.54) = 32.8 kN
Thus, we estimate d = Dc - 70 - No. 30 bar/2= 460 - 70 - 30/2 = 375 mm. Also, we have
b = 1.0 m fc = All kPa
Vc = fcdb = 417(0.375)(1.0) = 156.4 kN » 32.5 (OK)
The toe bending moment is
Mt = Vtoe X Toe/2
= 32.8(0.54/2) = 8.86kN-m/m
The maximum toe bending moment, based on concrete strength fc and depth J, is
Mmax = fcb^-jd = 9450(1.0)(°'36 ^°>375)(0.880 X 0.375) = 210.5 kN • m/m
The base depth d is more than adequate (210.5 » 8.86), now find the required amount of steel area
for balanced design:
Asfsjd = M1
A^JJd= 17OOOOXO8868OXO.375 = ^ ^ / m
= 158 mmVm
A; = 1.33(158) = 211 mmVm (Code i increase)
A'f = ^A8 = 0.0035(1000X460) = 1610mm2/m
Jy
AS>TS = 0.0018(1000 X 460) = 828 mm2/m (T and S)

Figure E12-6c

Which steel area do we use? Both the ACI and AASHTO have these requirements. Since 211
mm2/ni is 1.33 X 158, we can use that instead of the minimum flexural requirement of lA/fy.
The slab is far enough in the ground that the T and S requirement is not needed. We will examine
the possibility of using one No. 20 bar giving
A8 = 300mm2/m>211
on a spacing of 500 mm (less than 3 X base slab thickness) per ACI Art. 7.6.5. Since this is not a
balanced design, check steel and concrete stresses.
Summing moments about the neutral axis of Fig. 12-22a, we obtain

kd - ^- • 1 = nAs(d - kd)
n = io As = 300 mm

2 = 0.0003 m2 d = 0.375m

Substituting we find:

^Y~ = 10 X 0.0003(0.375 - kd)
kd = 0.04453 m jd = d - kd/3 = 0.360 m
Tjd = M -* Asfsjd = M

Solving for fs, we find

/ - = 0.0003x8 0.8 360xl000= 8 2 '0 4 M P a
T = As fs = 0.0003(82.04) = 0.02461 MN
Now C = fckd/2 = T9 which leads to

If we were selecting bars, we would use
1 No. 20 bar, giving A, = 300 = 300 mm2/m > 211
We could also use one No. 15 = 200 and one No. 10 = 100 for 300 mm2, but this choice mixes
bar sizes and is not desirable.
We could, of course, use any A5 between 211 and 828 mm2/m and be in code compliance—
but the closer to 211 mm2 the closer to balanced design. Welded wire fabric should definitely be a
contractor option, as it may give the most economical steel mass and labor costs.
For the heel there is a rectangular pressure block of q = 71.7 kPa on part of the base. There is
a vertical downward pressure from backfill, surcharge, and base of
tfdown = 17.30 X 2.44 + 12.0 + 23.6(0.46) = 65.1 kPa
Shear at the stem back face (from toe computations the allowable shear force = 156.4
kN)is
Vs,b = 1.21 X 65.1 - 0.65 x 71.7 = 32.17 kNj <c 156.4 kN
The moment at the approximate center of the stem steel is


H as required

From the just-completed toe computations we know that increasing this value by one-third will
control (but not quite a balanced design) so
A; = 1.33(623) = 828.6 mm2/m
We could use three No. 20 bars, giving 3(300) = 900 > 828.
Let us summarize the base slab:
A5, toe = 300 mm2/m
Awheel = 900 mm2/m
Depth is adequate for shear.
No T and S reinforcement for base slab.

If we use the No. 20 rebars and cut part of them, the lengths (the stem has a thickness of 230
mm) are as follows:
Toe: 540 - 70 + 12(20) = 710 mm (0.71 m)
Heel: 1210 - 70 + 12(20) = 1380 mm (1.38 m)
Since the base is 1.98 m and with clear cover full-length bars = 1980 - 2(70) = 1840 mm (1.84
m), it may not be worth the effort to cut the heel bars.
Step 6. Make the final design sketch of Fig. E12-6J to summarize the design. Note: We should not
select reinforcing bars at this point since any reasonable selection (presented here) is substantially in
excess of that required. Welded wire fabric may provide a suitable alternative that does not provide
excessive amounts of extra steel.

SHEET-PILE WALLS:
CANTILEVERED AND ANCHORED

13-1 INTRODUCTION
Sheet-pile walls are widely used for both large and small waterfront structures, ranging from
small pleasure-boat launching facilities to large dock structures where ocean-going ships can
take on or unload cargo. A pier jutting into the harbor, consisting of two rows of sheetpiling
to create a space between that is filled with earth and paved, is a common construction.
Sheetpiling is also used for beach erosion protection; for stabilizing ground slopes, partic-
ularly for roads (instead of using the walls of Chap. 12); for shoring walls of trenches and
other excavations; and for cofferdams. When the wall is under about 3 m in height it is of-
ten cantilevered (Fig. 13-1«); however, for larger wall heights it is usually anchored using
one or more anchors. The resulting wall is termed an anchored sheet-pile wall or anchored
bulkhead. Several of the more common wall configurations are illustrated in Fig. 13-1. The
alternative shown in Fig. 13- Id of using continuous rods for parallel sheet-pile walls may be
considerably more economical than driving pile anchorages—even for tie rod lengths of 30
to 40 m.
There are several methods of analyzing cantilever and anchored sheet-pile walls. Two of
the early methods were (a) the free-earth support and the (b) fixed-earth support, as shown
in Fig. 13-2 along with the simplified assumptions of active (from filled side) and passive
pressure on the free side below the dredge line. The design was based primarily on taking
moments about the anchor rod, increasing the depth of embedment D until X Fh was satis-
fied, and then computing the resulting bending moments in the piling. A safety factor was
incorporated by using a reduced Kp for passive pressure or by increasing the embedment
depth D some arbitrary amount such as 20 or 30 percent. Two of the simplifications could
result in errors:

1. Unless the anchor rod elongates sufficiently, the active pressure may not fully develop,
resulting in a computed anchor rod force that is too small.

2. The center of pressure below the dredge line is qualitatively shown by the dashed lines of
Fig. 13-2c and d and is closer to the dredge line than assumed using the passive pressure
profiles shown. The erroneous location of the center of pressure usually results in moments
that are too large.

Cantilever sheet-pile walls were analyzed similarly to anchored walls, except the soil pres-
sure profiles were slightly different and moments were usually taken about the base since
there was no anchor rod.
These were the only methods used in the United States and elsewhere until the mid-1960s
when Haliburton (1968) described a finite-difference method he and his coworkers had de-
veloped. Bowles (1974a, and included in the second and later editions of this textbook) used
the finite-element method (FEM) for sheet-pile wall analysis. As of this edition the free- and
fixed-earth support methods will no longer be presented.1 Although these two methods were
widely used, so many of the author's FEM programs are available (worldwide) and use of
personal computers is so widespread their continued inclusion is no longer warranted.

There is no "exact" method to analyze/design a sheet-pile type of wall. Both field observa-
tions and laboratory model tests show that there is a complex interaction of (as a minimum)
construction method (install and backfill, or install and excavate the free side), excavation
depth, stiffness of wall material, type and state of retained soil, and passive pressure resis-
tance. With anchored walls there is also the anchor geometry, initial anchor prestress (or load),
construction stage when anchor rod is installed, and behavior of that part of the wall above
the anchor rod (into or away from the backfill).
The two original methods named were oversimplifications of an extremely complex prob-
lem, relied totally on rigid body statics, and were based entirely on the assumptions of an
active earth pressure above the dredge line and passive earth pressure below. Wall and an-
chor rod stiffness did not enter into the equation. As a result of substantial overdesign, few
walls failed.
The FEM is somewhat less of an approximation. Additionally, it allows for better modeling
of the problem and gives more useful design information as part of the output. It requires a
computer program, but this is provided as program B-9 (FADSPABW) on your computer
diskette. Section 13-6 will present considerable detail on this method so it can be used in
design with reasonable confidence.
The finite-difference method (FDM) is not considered further because it offers no advan-
tage over the FEM and is more difficult to use. Indeed, it has these disadvantages: Constant-
length elements are required over the full pile length; the stiffness matrix cannot be banded;
and modeling boundary conditions of zero displacement and rotation is difficult.
The several materials and material configurations used for sheet piles will be given in Sec.
13-2 since they are used for walls in both this and the next two chapters.

13-2 TYPES AND MATERIALS USED FOR SHEETPILING
Sheetpiling materials may be of timber, reinforced concrete, or steel. Allowable design
stresses are often higher than in general building construction and may be from about 0.65
to 0.90 fy for steel2 and wood. Reinforced concrete design stresses may be on the order of
0.75/c' for unfactored loads. The design stress actually used will depend on engineering
judgment, effect of wall failure (site importance factor), and the local building code.
13-2.1 Timber Sheetpiling
Timber piling is sometimes used for free-standing walls of H < 3 m (see Fig. 13-Ia). It is
more often used for temporarily braced sheeting to prevent trench cave-ins (see Fig. 13- Ic)
during installation of deep water and sewer lines. If timber sheeting is used in permanent
structures above water level, preservative treatment is necessary, and even so the useful life
is seldom over 10 to 15 years. At present timber is little used except in temporary retaining
structures owing to both the scarcity of timber—particularly of large cross section—and cost.
Several timber piling shapes are shown in Fig. 13-3, of which the Wakefield and V groove
piling have been and are the most used. Dimensions shown are approximate and you will
have to use what is currently available.

2Value recommended by Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the principal producer of rolled sheetpiling in the United
States at present.


It is common to see low timber walls treated with wood preservative in use along water-
fronts. A substantial amount of timber piling—mostly fast-growing pine—is still used for
protection where the piling is driven, then surrounded with stabilizing blocks or boulders
(termed groins) to catch sand from the ocean side to maintain beaches. Here the intent is for
the wall eventually to become covered with sand from tidal action. Strength is not the primary
concern for this use, so if the wood lasts long enough to become buried, the purpose of the
wall has been accomplished.
If wood sheetpiling is being considered, the soil type is a major factor. Almost any driving
requires interfacing the pile hammer with a driving cap over the timber to minimize top
damage. Driving in hard or gravelly soil tends to damage or even split the pile tip. Damage
can sometimes be avoided by driving and pulling a steel mandrel or the like or by using a
water jet to create a "predrilled" hole to reduce the driving resistance. The sheeting may be
pointed, generally as shown in Fig. 13-4, and placed so that the pile being driven tends to
wedge against the previously driven pile.

13-2.2 Reinforced Concrete Sheetpiling
These sheet piles are precast concrete members, usually with a tongue-and-groove joint. Even
though their cross section is considerably dated (see Fig. 13-4), this form is still used. They are
designed for service stresses, but because of their mass, both handling and driving stresses
must also be taken into account. The points are usually cast with a bevel, which tends to
wedge the pile being driven against the previously driven pile.

The typical dimensions3 shown in Fig. 13-4 indicate the piles are relatively bulky. During
driving they will displace a large volume of soil for an increase in driving resistance. The
relatively large sizes, coupled with the high unit weight (yc = 23.6 kN/m3) of concrete,
mean that the piles are quite heavy and may not be competitive with other pile types unless
they are produced near the job site.
Dimensions and reinforcing bars shown in Fig. 13-4 are typical, but currently produced
piles will contain bars that are available to the producer at casting time.
If the joints are cleaned and grouted after they have been driven, a reasonably watertight
wall may be obtained. However, if the wall is grouted, expansion joints may be required along
the wall at intervals that are multiples of the section width.

13-2.3 Steel Sheetpiling
Steel sheetpiling is the most common type used for walls because of several advantages over
other materials:

3Soft-converted since only Fps units were used by U.S. industry in 1951.

Side Front Side Front


1. It is resistant to the high driving stresses developed in hard or rocky material.
2. It is relatively lightweight.
3. It may be reused several times.
4. It has a long service life either above or below water if it is provided with modest pro-
tection according to NBS (1962), which summarizes data on a number of piles inspected
after lengthy service. Watkins (1969) provides some guidance for considering corrosion
of sheetpiling in sea water. There is no available information on corrosion of steel piling
in chemically contaminated soil. There is a resistance probe [see Roy and Ramaswamy
(1983)] utilizing a set of electrodes, one of which is magnesium and the other is steel, that
can measure the resistance of the soil between them. The soil resistance is related to the
amount (in terms of "high" or "low" amount/likelihood) of expected steel pile corrosion.
5. It is easy to increase the pile length by either welding or bolting. If the full design length
cannot be driven, it is easy to cut the excess length using a cutting torch.
6. Joints are less apt to deform when wedged full with soil and small stones during driving.
7. A nearly impervious wall can be constructed by driving the sheeting with a removable
plug in the open thumb-and-finger joint. The plug is pulled after the pile is driven, and
the resulting cavity is filled with a plastic sealer. The next pile section is then driven with
the intersecting thumb or ball socket displacing part of the plastic sealer from the pre-
fixed cavity. When the piling is driven in pairs, sealing the intermediate joint by prefilling
may not provide a 100 percent impervious joint. Sellmeijer et al. (1995) describe an ex-
perimental wall project using this general approach but with European-produced piling,
which has a slightly different joint configuration than the standard "thumb-and-finger" or
"ball-and-socket" interlocks of piling produced in the United States (see Fig. 13-5).

Figure 13-5 illustrates several angle sections and joints that can be fabricated from cut
pieces of sheetpiling; these are for illustration, as other joints can be produced. The crosses
and wyes shown are used in cellular cofferdams (of Chap. 15); the angles and bends are used
for direction changes in the wall.
Several steel sheet-pile cross sections currently available are given in Tables A-3a and
A-3& in the Appendix. The straight-web sections are used in situations where the web is in
tension; the Z sections are used where large bending moments require a substantial moment
of inertia or section modulus.
When the stiffness capacity of the available Z piles is insufficient, the box sections of
Table A-3 (also as Fig. 13-6«) or the soldier-Z-pile combination of Fig. \3-6b might be used.

13-2.4 Composite Sheet-Pile Walls
Walls may be constructed using composite construction. The soldier beam-wood lagging
combination of Chap. 14 (Fig. 14-la) is an example.
Other examples include use of soldier beams4 on some spacing with sheetpiling used
between the spacings. For corrosion protection one might encase the upper part of steel
sheetpiling in concrete after it is driven, with the concrete extending from below the water line

to the pile top. A wood facing might also be used, or the lower part of the sheeting could be
made of steel and the upper part of a different material—wood or concrete.
Since steel is relatively durable in most waterfront installations, the principal composite
construction consists in using a mix of soldier beams and sheet piles or built-up box pile
sections.

13-3 SOIL PROPERTIES FOR SHEET-PILE WALLS
Referring to Fig. 13-2, we see that lateral earth pressures are involved with active pressures
approximately developed behind the walls from the fill (or backfill) and passive pressures in
front of the wall below the dredge line. Either the Rankine or Coulomb lateral earth-pressure
coefficients may be used for the earth pressures, however, the Coulomb values are generally
preferred. Because a sheet-pile wall is not very rigid, relatively large lateral displacements
(and resulting relative movement between soil and wall) often occur between points of as-
sumed fixity. Relative soil-wall movement produces adhesion and/or friction depending upon

the soil. Friction can be approximately accounted for by use of the Coulomb earth-pressure
coefficient. If the backfill is cohesive, you have to do the best you can. You might use
Fig. 11-1 Ic and Example 11-4 as a guide with a Coulomb Ka. You might also consider
programming Eq. (11-12) to give reduced values to account for cohesion. In this latter case
obtain the lateral pressure as
(Th = yzKa^ + cKac
For passive pressure use the ^/-coefficients.
Any backfill cohesion would appear to reduce the lateral pressure; however, give consid-
eration to a wall-soil tension crack, which would produce a surcharge effect on the soil below
the tension crack depth and negate most of its beneficial effect.
Even though it is known that wall friction develops, the Rankine earth-pressure coefficients
are often used for Ka, with the rationale being that they are slightly more conservative.
For the finite-element procedure it is necessary to use active earth-pressure coefficients
behind the wall and the concept of the modulus of subgrade reaction ks for the soil below the
dredge line. The use of ks allows one to model the dredge line soil as a series of nodal springs
on the wall to assist in resisting lateral displacement.
From this discussion it is evident that we need soil parameters of y, $, and cohesion for
both the wall backfill and the base soil. Because the wall must survive the initial loading as
well as long-term loading, the undrained strength parameters are usually used. In the case of
waterfront structures the soil below the water line will always be in an undrained state, but
close to the wall a small zone may be in a consolidated undrained state. For on-shore retaining
structures the dredge line soil is exposed to the weather and the state varies from saturated to
dry. Since the undrained state is usually the worst case, it is appropriate to use that for design.
Seldom are laboratory tests performed to obtain these parameters. It is common to use
CPT or SPT data and/or simply estimate <fi and y. The retained material is often backfill
with little to no compaction; if it is hydraulically dredged silty sand, precise soil parameters
are extremely difficult to obtain. The base soil into which the sheet pile is driven is more
amenable to laboratory tests on recovered samples. However, in nearly all cases either SPT
or CPT data are all that are taken. When one is using the SPT in cohesive soil, field qu tests
are routinely performed on recovered (but highly disturbed) samples. In this case the values
for su = c = qu/2 are obtained for cohesive soils, and the SPT or CPT data are converted
to an estimate of <f> and y for cohesionless soils using correlations such as those given in
Chap. 3. The unit weight of cohesive soils can be obtained using the procedure of Example
2-1. For loose sand backfill a y of 12.5 to 14 kN/m3 (80-90 pcf) might be used, but exercise
care in using these values, for sand in this state may consolidate over time and produce a
great increase in the lateral pressure/force.
If the equipment is available, one should perform laboratory tests of the direct shear or
direct simple shear type to obtain an approximation of the plane strain cf) angle. In most cases,
as previously stated, the angle of internal friction is simply "estimated" with conservative
values in the range of 28 to 32° commonly used; any testing is likely to be isotropically
consolidated compression (CIUC) triaxial tests.

13-3.1 Drained Conditions
When the dredge line soil is cohesive and not submerged, particularly if some soil is ex-
cavated to produce the dredge line, one should use both undrained (total stress) and drained


(effective stress) strength conditions for the dredge line su. Cohesive soil under long-term
loading tends to a drained state above the water table.
When soil is excavated to produce the dredge line, unloading occurs. For cohesive soil
above the GWT this produces an initial increase in su as a result of negative pore pressures,
but over time the suction disappears and a drained state may develop (or alternate between
a total and drained state with rainfall). Figure 2-28b indicates that there can be a substantial
decrease in shear strength in transition from the total to an effective stress state.
For submerged cohesive soil below the dredge line, excavation also produces soil suction,
but with water available the water content slightly increases with a resulting loss in strength
su. In this case one should use consolidated-undrained tests, which give both a small total
stress (f> and cohesion c. Below the water surface the soil consolidates under lateral pres-
sure to a consolidated-undrained state. This might be approximated in a laboratory shear test
by consolidating a sample to in situ pressure in the presence of water, then unloading it to
represent the final overburden state with the water available to allow an increase in water
content. When one believes enough time has passed (several days) to allow for stabilization
one should perform the test without allowing drainage.
Daniel and Olson (1982) thought the use of total instead of effective strength parameters
caused a major bulkhead failure. In this case one can question the conclusion that not using
drained strength parameters caused the failure. Here the dredge line soil was permanently
below the water table, where all that could develop is a consolidated undrained state. The
dredging that took place in front of this wall after it was constructed produced a sloping
dredge line. One can speculate that unloading the soil of overburden produced some expan-
sion and an increase in water content from suction, causing a strength reduction. This wall
was constructed in the late 1970s, and the designer used the classical method of analysis.
Thus, not a great deal of design information would have been obtained to provide guidance
in the design compared with using the FEM. Although Daniel and Olson (1982) also stated
that there was no way to ascertain exactly what caused the wall failure, their description of
the bulging (lateral wall deformation away from the backfill) before failure makes it evident
that there was an increase in lateral pressure in the backfill. This may have been accompa-
nied by some loss of dredge line soil strength (or carrying capacity) as a result of sloping the
dredge line and/or soil suction.

13-3.2 Angle of Wall Friction S
The angle of wall friction 8 can be estimated from Table 11-6 or directly measured for im-
portant projects. Any direct measurements between the soil and wall material should use a
pressure that is on the order of what is expected in the prototype, since 8 is somewhat pressure-
dependent. If (j) < 5, you assume a frictionless interface (but there may be adhesion, since a
4> < 8 soil would have cohesion).
For metal sheetpiling of Z and deep web shapes, the unit width of wall will include a
minimum slip zone, part of which is soil-to-soil and part soil-to-steel as in Fig. 13-5a. In this
case one can use an average (or weighted average) value for 8 as

tan 8' = — (weighting factors not included)

where cf) — angle of internal friction of contact soil and 8 = the friction angle from Table
11-6 or measured in a laboratory test.


13-3.3 Modulus of Subgrade Reaction, ks
The finite-element method uses ks in the passive pressure region below the dredge line in front
of the wall. The author has shown [Bowles (1974a)] that this model is reasonably correct by
using it to analyze full-scale field walls and to reanalyze large model sheet-pile walls reported
by Tschebotarioff (1949) and small models used by Rowe (1952). Estimates of ks can be made
using the procedures given in Sec. 9-6; however, we need the equation given there that has a
depth parameter Z as
ks = As + BsZn (9-10)
Alternative equation forms (which are in your computer program B-9) are
ks- = As + Bs^ tan"1 (Z/D)
ks = As + B8(ZlDf
with the restriction that the exponent n > 0 [cannot be 0 or (-)].
We can approximate these equations by using
ks = C(S¥)qa or ks = CquXi
where qa = bearing capacity computed at several depths in the likely range of pile embed-
ment depth D and qa = <?uit/SF. The C factor is
c = a ( k m (SI); Wi ft (Fps)
This expression gives C = 40 for SI and C = 12 for Fps. The safety factor is SF = 3 for
cohesive soil and SF = 2 for cohesionless soils. We can then plot the several values of ks
versus depth Z and obtain a best fit for the foregoing equation.
Alternatively one might use one of the bearing-capacity equations from Table 4-1, simpli-
fied (no shape, depth, inclination, base, or ground factors) to read
ks = 7w = C(cNc + qNq + a5^5^}
where A// = is an assumed displacement of 0.0254 m (^ ft) when the ultimate bearing
pressure qu\t is developed (and gives C = 1/0.0254 = 40 or 12). Separating terms, we have
the following:
As = C(cNc + 0.5y X 1 X N7)] ( 1 3 1 )
BsZn = C(yNqZl) J
The use of 1 in the equation for A5 is for B = unit width of wall. An upper limit can be placed
on ks by using something other than n = 1 in Eqs. (13-1) or using one of the previously given
alternatives. We do not want ks to become unreasonably large because driving difficulties
generally limit sheet-pile embedment depths D to 5 to 6 m.
Some persons have suggested an upper limit on ks be the passive pressure. Since there are
difficulties with computing crp for small </> angles one might use computer program WEDGE
on your diskette (see also Sec. 13-5) to obtain Pp. Compare this result to the sum of the
computed (+) node forces [do not include any (—) values] below the ground line, and if

X , node -^ *p
arbitrarily increase the depth of embedment 0.3 to 0.6 m and make another analysis.


Using the FEM and computer program B-9 allows you to make a parametric study rapidly
(vary pile section /, ks, embedment depth D, anchor rod location, and so on). You will gen-
erally find that the preceding suggestions for ks will give reasonable values for pile bending
and node soil pressure. Deflections are highly dependent on the flexural rigidity EI of the
pile and ks, so if you want a reliable dredge line value you have to input a carefully chosen
ks. Keep in mind that exact values are not possible, for too many variables are beyond the
designer's control. What is desired is enough output data to make a design with reasonable
confidence that the wall will serve its intended purpose.
The FEM allows you to consider nonlinear effects using the term Xmax identified in
Sec. 9-6 and used in Example 13-1 following. A program should do these things (as incor-
porated into B-9):

1. Allow adjustment of the dredge line springs to account for driving or excavation damage
to the soil
2. Remove node springs when the computed X1- > Xmax and recycle

13-4 STABILITY NUMBERS FOR SHEET-PILE WALLS
13-4.1 Stability Numbers and Safety Factors
The concept of stability number (or safety factor) for sheet-pile walls is somewhat a mis-
nomer, since it is not clear just what it means. For this discussion it is more convenient to use
the term safety factor (SF) rather than stability number, which implies the ratio of system
resistance/system failure effects. In classical sheet-pile wall design it has been common to
do one of the following:

1. Divide the Rankine (or Coulomb) Kp by a SF for the soil below the dredge line. Some
designers might use Ka larger than the Rankine or Coulomb value as well.
2. Arbitrarily increase the computed embedment depth by some factor, say, 1.2 to 1.3.

The author suggests that a more rational method is needed to estimate probable wall safety.
This is done as follows:

1. Do a wall analysis using the existing conditions to find the depth required such that any
depth increase does not change the dredge line deflection (at least within some tolerance
of, say, 2 to 3 mm). This depth D\ is all that is required for stability for the given load
conditions.
2. Next make trial runs with the depth increased several arbitrary amounts (perhaps 0.5, 1.0,
1.5 m). Make additional analyses and make a table of dredge line displacements versus
these depths and the depth from step 1.
3. From an inspection of the table from step 2, choose an arbitrary new depth of embedment
Dnew- Assume a loss of dredge line so the new depth is more than the dredge line loss, or
Aiew > Di + dredge line loss
4. Now revise a copy of the original FEM data set to show the new dredge line location and
new depth (compute additional active pressure values that are in the dredge line soil).
Because the dredge line loss is probably attributable to erosion, it may not be neces-
sary to reduce ks of the first one or two nodes for driving or other damage but look at the


conditions. Make the computer analysis with this new data set. Do not recycle for depth,
but do a nonlinear check.
5. Check this output to see if the bending moment can be carried by the sheet-pile section
chosen. If not, increase the section. Also check if the toe node moves forward and how
much. A large forward movement represents a soil shear failure and the embedment depth
would have to be increased. If you change sheet-pile sections recycle to step 1. If you
increase D recycle to step 4.
6. When step 5 is adequate, make another copy of this data set with the dredge line reset to
the original location. Now add a backfill surcharge (or increase any existing surcharge) and
recompute the active earth-pressure profile. Make the FEM analysis and see whether the
section can carry this bending moment—if not, increase the section. Check whether the toe
tends to kick out (translate forward). If it does, increase the pile embedment depth. If you
change sections recycle to step 1; if you increase the embedment depth recycle to step 2.

When you have obtained satisfactory solutions from steps 3, 4, and 6, you have a suitable
design. Now, what is the resulting safety factor? One possibility is that the maximum increase
in depth Dnew from steps 3 and 6 might be divided by the required depth D\. Probably the
best solution is to give the client a compact report showing the pile section and embedment
depth and to indicate what loss of dredge line may produce a failure or what the maximum
allowable surcharge is. File a copy and the computer printouts in case problems develop later;
put the data sets on a diskette.
The finite-element method provides a relatively rapid means to analyze changed field con-
ditions. The classical methods are much less amenable to these types of analyses and thus
encourage use of an SF. If you do the analysis as outlined above and compare it to a classical
design, you may find that a SF of 1.2 to 1.3 does not provide the required margin of safety
for certain changed'field conditions, particularly loss of dredge line.

13-4.2 Moment Reduction
From your computer output you will see that the soil node reactions below the dredge line
produce a center of pressure that is closer to the dredge line than indicated by the linear Rank-
ine/Coulomb profiles shown on Fig. 13-2c and d. This center of pressure results in computed
moments that are less than those computed from the classical theories but have been con-
firmed by the small-scale model tests of Rowe (1952, 1957) and the larger-scale model tests
of Tschebotarioff (1949). To account for this moment reduction, Rowe introduced the concept
of moment reduction as a means to reduce moments computed by classical methods so the
design would not be overly conservative (at least for bending). It is evident that the FEM
directly gives the "reduced" design moment—applying Rowe's moment reduction method is
not easy.

13-5 SLOPING DREDGE LINE
In many sheet-pile wall configurations the dredge line is not horizontal (/3 = 0°) but rather
slopes away from the wall (/3 < 0°). How should we treat this situation? There are two cases:

1. The soil below the dredge line is a sand with <fi > 28 to 30°.
2. The soil below the dredge line is a cohesive material with a small </> angle and cohesion c.


In case 1 we can use the Coulomb equation [Eq. (11-6)] to compute two values of Kp: one
for a horizontal dredge line Kp>h using /3 = 0, the other for a sloping dredge line Kps using
a ( - ) /3. We can use these values to obtain a reduced kS}S for program input as

Ks = KH^ (13-2)

where kSth is your best estimate of a horizontal value that will be reduced to take into account
the sloping dredge line.
For case 2 we cannot get a valid Kp from Eq. (11-6), so we will rely on the trial wedge
method of Sec. 11-12.1 to obtain passive forces5 Pp. For this, use program WEDGE on your
program diskette. This program is specifically written to obtain the passive earth force for
either a horizontal or sloping dredge line. It uses the embedment depth D for the "wall" H.
We make two trials:

Trial 1: Dredge line horizontal (use only a single line) as in Fig. 13-1 a, obtain PPth, and
Trial 2: Dredge line sloping as in Fig. 13-7 b and obtain PPfS.

Notes:

Generally, use wall friction 6 = 0.
Pp is obtained by plotting force polygons
until a minimum value is found.

(a) Horizontal dredge line

Figure 13-7 The case of sloping dredge line. Use program WEDGE from your diskette and solve both cases to
obtain PPtH and Pps. Note coordinates to use. For X = ? use a value of about 4 to 5H.

5Terzaghi (1954) indicated that passive earth force is a factor but did not elaborate on how to apply its effect for
the sloping dredge line.

(b) Sloping dredge line


From these two values we can compute a reduction factor (RF) for the several values of
ks below the sloping dredge line using

RF - ^ M and ks>s = RF X jfcJfA (13-3)

where /:5>5 = sloping value
K,h = best estimate of a horizontal value

For this case you must be able to input node values of ks as a program option (allowed with
program B-9).
As outlined in Sec. 13-4.1 you initiate the design of a wall for a sloping dredge line by going
through design steps 1 and 2. At this point you make an initial embedment depth selection
Anit- Now you use that DjnJ1 and the kStS and check if DjnJt is adequate. Next check for loss of
dredge line and increased surcharge.
When you check the computer output for each of the foregoing cases, you will notice that
the moments are larger than for the horizontal ground case. You will also note that the nodal
soil reactions will be larger near the dredge line and decrease with depth (this is similar to the
horizontal case). There may even be negative values if the embedment depth is larger than
needed for this analysis (but you increased it for other reasons).
Nevertheless, we need to check whether the computer program output is a possible solution
and this can be determined as follows:

1. Sum by hand the node spring forces (tabulated in a table on the output sheets) and compute
the passive force for the sloping dredge line as PP)Sd\'
PP,c = ^ ^springs then Check P^sdi > PPtC
If you have a cohesionless dredge line soil, compute PASdi for use in the preceding as
PpMi = \yD2Kp,sd\> if cohesive, use program WEDGE. This check assumes the limiting
wall resistance is the passive force for a wall whose height is the embedment depth. The
limiting passive force must be larger than that computed in the analysis [the sum of the
(+) node reactions].
2. If PPtC > PPfSd\ you initially have three options to try:
a. Try a larger pile section, because a stiffer section may even out the nodal reactions
somewhat.
b. Increase the embedment depth. [Note: This step will not improve the solution if the
bottom soil nodes have ( - ) reactions.]
c. Try a lower node location for the anchor rod.

If none of these produces PPfSd\ > PPtC consult with the geotechnical engineer who pro-
vided the soil data. It may be necessary to build up or modify the dredge line slope or use one
of the walls of Chap. 12.
Schroeder and Roumillac (1983) conducted a model wall study in sand that showed that
the sloping dredge line case produced less passive resistance than for horizontal ground;
however, this result could have been predicted prior to any testing. Their tests showed that as
the slope increased, so did the bending moments in the sheet pile. The FEM analysis using
the foregoing ks reductions does precisely that.

13-6 FINITE-ELEMENT ANALYSIS
OF SHEET-PILE WALLS
The finite-element method presented in the following material is the most efficient and ra-
tional method for the design of sheet-pile wall design/analysis currently available. The same
program is applicable for both cantilever (Fig. 13-Ia) and anchored (Fig. 13-Ib) walls and,
with some adjustment, can be used for the braced walls of Fig. 13-Ic. It directly gives the
lateral displacement profile (valid for that set of soil parameters and pile stiffness) as well
as nodal pressures in the passive zone in front of the wall, bending moments at nodes, and
force(s) in the anchor rod(s). Multiple anchor levels can be as readily accommodated as a
single anchor; and parametric studies for optimum anchor location can be made very easily,
for data copies can be made and edited with the new location.
Any wall material can be analyzed—we are not limited to sheet piles as given in Sec. 13-2.
You can use the program for composite sheet piles (part is one material with E\ and part has
an E2). In this case it is only necessary to adjust the input so that the program computes EI
correctly. For example, if E\ is the base material and you use a second material of E2, simply
adjust the moments of inertia Im so that you have
E1In = E2I2 -> Im = ^ 1 (13-4)
where Im = adjusted value of actual moment of inertia for material m.
The FEM analysis finds the center of pressure to sustain the wall in a soil-pile interaction
mode rather than making arbitrary assumptions about passive pressure as in the classical
methods. Another particular advantage is that the same method of developing the stiffness
matrix used for the beam-on-elastic foundation of Sec. 9-8 can be used for sheet-pile walls,
so very little new material has to be learned.
The finite-element method uses the same equations as given in Chap. 9 and repeated here
for convenience:
p = AF e = ATX F = Se
and substituting, we obtain
F = SA1X P = ASA1X
X = (ASA1T1P
which are the wall deflections consisting of translations and rotations of the several nodes.
With the deflections at each node known, the bending moments are computed using the ele-
ment ESAT as
F = ESA1X
The element shear is computed from the element bending moments, but the node reactions
and anchor rod force are directly computed using the spring equation of
F = K(I)X(I)
Study Fig. 13-8 carefully, for it illustrates the sheet-pile wall and P-X coding, the element
forces, soil node springs, and the sign convention—this last is absolutely essential to interpret
output. The problem is actually the beam-on-elastic-foundation problem turned 90° with the
soil springs removed above the dredge line.
Anchor rods are allowed for by considering that an anchor rod will consist in a member
of cross section A, modulus of elasticity E9 and some length L. Now, the axial displacement in

soil ks and anchor rod springs are input as nodal entries. Here the anchor is identified with node 2, and the program computes
soil springs (£3 shown) for nodes 5 through 9, which are then added at NP locations of 4 (anchor rod), 10,12,14,16, and 18 (soil
springs) in the stiffness matrix [STIFF(I)].

this type of member is similar to the bar of a truss and is given in any Mechanics of Materials
text as

where X = nodal displacement computed from inverting the ASAT matrix
P = anchor rod force

To obtain the anchor rod force, one must place the anchor rod at a node. The anchor rod
spring(s) AE/L (where force/length = units of a spring) are part of the input data required
by the program. Earth anchors used in tieback construction (Chap. 14) usually slope from the
horizontal, but we can input the horizontal component of the spring and obtain the horizontal
component of force. It is then a trivial computation to obtain the axial force in the tieback
or anchor rod. Since we always analyze a unit width of wall, the AE/L of the anchor rod
is prorated based on the anchor rod spacing s [which is often more than a unit width—say,
1.5 to 2.0 m (5 to 6 ft)]. For spacing s (Fig. 13-9c) and defining 77 = slope with horizontal
(Fig. 13-9e), the input anchor rod spring is

For each anchor rod the preceding computation for its spring is made by hand and input
into the data set. An input program parameter identifies the number of springs used, and other
input identifies their node locations.
Soil springs are computed by the program in a subroutine and saved into an array for
recycling as necessary. Similarly the program builds the banded stiffness matrix (always
four entries wide X NP).

GENERAL PROGRAM OVERVIEW. This program uses a large number of subroutines so
that any program modifications can be isolated for easier debugging.
The first subroutine that might be used is a universal subroutine DATAIN, which allows
you to create a data file that is always saved to disk on program exit. Since you have only the
compiled program the first time you use this program, to create a data file you should do a
series of <PRT-SCREEN> keypresses to obtain a paper listing of the several lines of input
data. You do not have to use this routine if you already have a data file on disk.
There is a USERMANL.DOC file on your diskette that both identifies and gives the or-
der of input for selected data for applicable programs; you should print and file this for a
convenient reference when using that program. You should print one data set and write in
the variable names so that, when you want to do parameter studies, you can quickly identify
the applicable control parameters. The element and most other data are readily identified by
looking at the data set.
In subroutine INPUT the element lengths are read from the input file, and on any recycling
the element lengths below the dredge line are increased by the input parameter DEPINC. This
approach allows us to find the optimum embedment depth by starting with a small value of
DEMB and incrementing it using DEPINC. In previous versions of this program the elements
were of constant length below the dredge line—this version allows variable lengths initially
but all added increments are the value of DEPINC.
The node NPs are computed in subroutine INPUT, so they do not have to be input by hand.

Incrementing depth of embedment. When the depth is incremented, the program increases
NP by 2. Under these initial conditions,
DEPINC = 0.3 DEMB = 1.5 m
15 elements (16 nodes) and NP = 32
the first depth increment gives
DEMB = 1.5 + 0.3 = 1.8m 16 elements (17 nodes)
NP = 32 + 2 = 34 and so on
If an equation is used to compute ks and additional nodes are created using DEPINC,
the program automatically computes ks for the new node. If you input values of ks for each
node, you must assume that the program may increment the depth NCYC times. Thus, it is
necessary to input sufficient additional node ks values so that there is a value for any new
node produced. The number NK of ks to input is as follows:
NCYC = 1: NK = NM - JTSOIL + 2
NCYC > 1: NK = NM - JTSOIL + NCYC H- 2
If you do not input enough ks values according to the preceding, the program will output a
message and stop. If this happens, use your DOS editor to recover the disk file and insert the
additional ks entries as required.


Subroutine LOAD allows us to input the node pressures from the top node to the first
node below the dredge line (1 to JTSOIL + 1). One must input a value of 0.0 for the first
node below the dredge line, as the program uses the pressure profile illustrated in Fig. 13-Sd
to compute node forces at nodes 1 through JTSOIL + 1 using the average end area method.
This subroutine also allows input of node P matrix entries using NNZP > O, so a strut/anchor
rod can be modeled as either a force or a spring. The load (P) matrix is saved for reuse when
NCYC > 1.
Subroutine SPRING computes both the node ks (if an equation is used) and the soil springs
below the dredge line. If an equation is used for the soil below the dredge line to obtain node
ks the program allows the use of two reduction factors, FACl and FAC2. Factor FACl is used
to reduce the ks values as follows:
SK(JTSOIL) = FAC1*SK(JTSOIL)
SK(JTSOILH-I) = FAC2*SK(JTS0IL+l)
In earlier editions of this text a single factor REDFAC was used to reduce the dredge line soil
spring for driving and other disturbance. It has since been found that it is more realistic to
reduce the soil modulus. The preceding reductions will affect the top three node springs by
varying amounts. Since FACl, FAC2 are not specified, they can be 1.0, but their relationship
must be FAC2 > FAC1. Usually, take FAC1 on the order of 0.6 to 1.0 and FAC2 on the order
of 0.7 to 1.0.
If node ks values are input, any reductions for dredge line damage or for other causes are
made before their entry so that the control parameter to input soil node springs will be input
as NRC = 0.
It is in this subroutine that the anchor rod springs are input using IAR = number of anchor
rods. We input all springs via node identification (/) and spring value (SPRNG).
Subroutine BSTIF is then called to build the element stiffness matrix ESAT and EASAT
for each element in turn. This routine calls subroutine BANDM to band the global ASAT. The
result is a rectangular matrix four columns wide X NP rows, a particularly attractive feature
of this program over a finite-difference method. This is saved in a single array STIFF(I) to
save memory. The ESAT is saved in this routine so that it can be used later to compute the
element bending moments. This routine is used each time the depth is incremented.
Subroutine MODIF is next called so that the stiffness matrix can be modified to add the
previously computed soil (and anchor) springs to the appropriate diagonal nodes. This routine
also allows input of boundary conditions based on NZX > O. Those NP values that have
known displacements (say, zero translation and/or rotation) are input in array NXZERO(I)
and the known displacements input in array XSPEC(I) and in the same order. This procedure
allows us, for example, to fix the top of the wall (or any other node location). Although the
program allows nonzero XSPEC(I) values, seldom will we know any boundary displacements
other than zero.
LISTB allows you to write the band matrix so that you can check whether the boundary
cases were correctly identified. At a boundary location there should be a 1.0 in the first column
(the diagonal) and three horizontal and diagonal 0.0s from that position.
Subroutine SOLVI is called next to reduce the band matrix, and in the process it replaces
the P matrix with the displacement matrix. This is the reason for saving the original P matrix
when N C Y O 1.
Subroutine CONVER is called if NCYC > 1, and in this case the program always does at
least two cycles so that the current and previous dredge line displacements can be compared.


When two successive values are within the range of the input value CONV (usual range of
0.002 to 0.003 m) recycling stops.
In case convergence is not obtained in NCYC iterations, inspect the last output (also check
for any input errors) and/or increase the initial depth of embedment DEMB and rerun.
Subroutine CHECK is called after dredge line convergence if NONLIN > 0 to see if any
dredge line displacements X(I) > XMAX(I). For a valid check, short element lengths should
be used in a zone near the dredge line, since it is nodes in that zone that will have any X(I) >
XMAX(I). When a node displacement is larger than XMAX(I), a node force is computed as
follows:
F - -K(I) * XMAX(I) (13-6)
This force (with sign) is inserted into the P matrix and spring K(I) is set to 0.0, and the
problem is recycled until the number of springs set to zero equals the number required to be
set to zero. More than one spring may be zeroed on any cycle.
Setting a spring to zero can produce a substantial discontinuity in the soil-pile model. The
effect is reduced by using closer-spaced nodes.
It is also necessary to recycle when making a nonlinear check. Since the negative force
K(I) * XMAX(I) is less than was required by the previous analysis, the node displacement
will increase. This change may result in the next lower node having X(I) > XMAX(I), and
so on; if this were to occur for all the nodes the system would be unstable and you might get
a halt in execution with an exponent overflow error reported. Otherwise, you get very large
displacements in the soil below the dredge line, which indicate a shear failure.
When the program recycles for nonlinear effects the embedment depth is not incremented.
The nonlinear check is a reasonably realistic procedure for this model and usually produces
three items of considerable interest:

1. Dredge line zone displacements are increased.
2. Bending moments in the pile are slightly increased.
3. Anchor rod force increases.

Subroutine FORCE is called when convergence and displacement criteria (or NCYC = 1 )
are met. By using the last-computed displacement matrix, the element end moments, shears,
the anchor rod force, and the soil spring reactions (forces) R(I) and the soil pressures Q(I)
are computed. These soil values are computed as

R(I) = x ( i ) * K ( i ) and Q(I) = x(l)*SK(i)

The program uses SK(I) for ks\ Q(I) for soil pressure q\ and / for the translation NP-value.
Steps in a sheet-pile wall design. Steps in making a finite-element solution should include
at least the following:

1. Assemble available site (importance factor) and soil information.
2. Draw the soil-wall system to a reasonable scale and decide on node locations. Tentatively
locate anchor rod node(s) since a search may be made for a best node location. Both
bending moments and rod forces are sensitive to location of the anchor rod node.


Locate nodes where soil stratum changes occur and at the GWT. Try to keep the ratio
of adjacent element lengths under 5 and preferably under 3. Element lengths do not have
to be constant, as for the finite-difference method. Where output is not limited (as it is in
the following text examples, to save text pages) lengths should be on the order of 0.4 to
0.6 m with some as short as 0.3 m in critical regions.
3. Compute the lateral soil pressure from ground surface to the dredge line using Ka from
the Coulomb (preferably) or Rankine equations; however, it may be appropriate to use a
larger value if site conditions warrant. Where the strata change, use an average pressure
value, which will introduce a small computational error for the node force unless the two
contributing elements are equal in length. There can be much busywork in this step, so
a program such as B-25 is recommended.
4. Estimate ks below the dredge line. For depths up to about 5 m there should not be a
great difference between the value for the dredge line and that for lower nodes; for clay a
constant value based on the upper soil may be adequate. For sand there would be a small
increase with depth.
5. Locate any nodes where you will input soil springs (NRC > 0) to replace program-
computed values. These may be where marked differences in adjacent strata occur, soft
lenses or thin strata of poor soil have been identified, cavities are known, and similar.
Note: It may be preferable to input all node ks values (an equation would probably not
apply in this case anyway). That way, node springs that would give an incorrect soil
pressure would not have to be input.
6. Select a tentative wall section and obtain the moment of inertia/unit width and sec-
tion modulus/unit width so that the output moments can be checked for actual bending
stresses. It is a trivial task to edit a copy of the data file to use a stiffer (or less stiff)
section.
7. Select a tentative anchor rod cross section A, length L, and spacing s so the anchor rod
spring can be computed using Eq. (13-5). It is a trivial task to edit the data file to input
a larger- (or smaller-) diameter anchor rod. It is possible, however, to use other sections
such as double angles, small I or W sections, square rods, etc. for the anchor "rod." Rods
are usually more practical.
8. You have the option of either inputting an anchor rod force or a spring—the spring is
usually preferable. You also have the option of inputting either node forces or node earth-
pressure values—pressure is usually preferable. If you input a node force for the anchor
rod, use IAR = 0 (no rod) and use NNZP = 1 to input the force. If you input node forces
in lieu of the wall pressures input IPRESS = 0 and NNZP = IPRESS.
9. Check the output for overstress or excessive displacements. The largest element moment,
anchor rod force, and soil pressure are checked by the user for
M F
/, = - < / . fs = - ^ < fa and Q(I) < qa

You will have allowable stress values fa for the piling and anchor rod but you may not
have a qa for the soil. Even so, you can still check if the node soil pressures are reasonable
or possible. They probably should not exceed the vertical bearing capacity or the passive
earth pressure (or force using program WEDGE) at about the middepth of embedment.
Finally, check the node displacements below the dredge line. If they are all forward
and sufficiently large, it is evident that a slip failure has formed. For example, if the


bottom node has a +X displacement of 0.002 m (about 2 mm) this is negligible; however,
if the +X displacement is 0.003 to 0.010 m this may be large enough for a slip failure in
the base soil. The embedment depth should be increased and the entire design recycled.
Depending on anchor rod location, wall height, and stiffness, one or more of the nodes
above the top anchor rod may have a (-) displacement, indicating the development of
passive pressure. You might approximate this by rerunning the data set with the active
pressure entries increased by using a small surcharge whose magnitude depends on the
type of backfill and the (-) displacement—perhaps 10 kPa for a dense sandy backfill
when the (-) X is on the order of 0.006 m.
10. The overall wall stability must be checked when a design has been produced for which
statics are satisfied, none of the elements are overstressed, and displacements are not
deemed excessive. The overall stability is considered in some detail in Sec. 13-9.

13-7 FINITE-ELEMENT EXAMPLES
The following examples will illustrate the FEM in a general manner and can be reproduced
using program FADSPABW (B-9) on your diskette with the included data sets. Expertise can
only be gained by making a number of computations in parametric studies, which are beyond
the scope of a textbook. Also it is not possible to show the iterations necessary to optimize any
of these examples because there is too much output for a textbook. The data sets are included
so that you can do this without much effort.
Example 13-1. Anchored sheet-pile walls (or anchored bulkheads).
Given, the soil-wall system in a silty cohesionless material as in Fig. El3-Ia. The initial location
of the wall line is such that about half the depth shown is initially retained and material is to be
dredged from the front. This location allows the piling to be driven and the anchors set. Then the
remaining front soil is excavated and mixed with imported sand to produce a backfill with properties
estimated as shown. The top will be paved so that boats can load and unload. We will account for
those activities with a 25 kPa surcharge. The soil below the dredge line is a silty clay with some
sand, and the average of consolidated-undrained tests on several tube samples gives the properties
shown.
Required. Find a suitable rolled sheet-pile section and anchor rod for the system.
Solution. Estimate y = 16.50 kN/m3 above and below the water line. The angle of internal friction
$ may be on the order of 34 to 36°, but we will conservatively use (f> = 30° since the dredged soil
will be somewhat loose—at least initially.
With the same water level on both sides of the wall (the interlocks are seldom watertight un-
less sealed as noted in Sec. 13-2.3) the water pressure is ignored. We must, however, use y' =
6.70 kN/m3 in computing the lateral earth pressure below the water line. The dredge line ysat is
obtained by trimming a sample and performing a direct measurement as in Example 2-1.
Step 1. Draw Fig. El3-1« based on the given data and tentative node locations; plot Fig. E13-IZ?
to keep track of the initial P-X coding. Plot the lateral earth-pressure profile of Fig. El 3-Ic for
reader convenience. The pressure profile uses the Coulomb Ka = 0.3 shown since there was little
variation for any reasonable 8 angle. The information to plot the node forces of Fig. E13-Id was
obtained from outputs of an initial trial program execution. They can also be computed from the
pressure profile of Fig. E13-Ic using the average end area method, and nodes 1 and 2 are hand-
computed (for illustration) as follows:

Figure E13- Ie illustrates the significance of using a different XMAX(I) for the top several nodes
below the dredge line.
Comments

1. The node spacing above the dredge line is as shown to save space. Ideally a node spacing of 0.6
(instead of 1.2) and 0.5 (instead of 1.0) would be used. The element length transition ratio at the
dredge line is 1.0/0.3 = 3.333, and 0.5/0.3 would be much preferred.
2. As part of this design, additional nodes are shown below the 1.8-m initial embedment depth. You
will see their purpose later.
3. The node forces of Fig. El 3- Id are from computer output sheets and would not usually be shown
like this. A better location is on the output sheets beside their listing—or not at all.

Step 2. From the initial P-X coding and general node configuration for the total depth of 9.0 + 1.8 =
10.8 m, obtain the following initial values (the text output sheets will use slightly different values
in some cases):

NM = 1 4 (initial count of 8 above and 6 below the dredge line)
NP = 30 [2 X (NM + I)]
There are no input forces —> NNZP = 0
Use 1 load case -> NLC = 1
For a sheet-pile wall, ITYPE = 1
We do not need a listing of the band matrix -» LISTB = 0
Recycle limit -» NCYC = 5
No soil springs to input —• NRC = 0

The foregoing eight parameters are the first line of input in the given sequence after the project
TITLE. The next line in order is as follows:

Dredge line soil starts at node 9 by count -» JTSOIL = 9
Activate the nonlinear routine -» NONLIN = 1
Anchor rod at node 2 —> IAR = 2
No known displacements —» NZX = 0
There are JTSOIL + 1 pressure entries -» IPRESS = 10
We are using SI units -* IMET = 1

The next line of input contains the following (in order):
E = modulus of elasticity of steel pile = 200 000 MPa
DEMB = initial embedment depth = 6 x 0 . 3 = 1.8m
CONV = dredge line displacement convergence = 0.002 m (2 mm)
DEPINC = depth increment for recycling = 0.3 m
BSHP = width used (usually 1 unit) = 1.0 m


Sheet-pile and anchor rod sections must be selected and later revised as necessary. For the initial
trial let us use an anchor rod with these properties:
Diam = 55 mm Spacing s = 1.83 m Length L = 10.83 m
Steel grade = 250 (A-36 with fy = 250 MPa)
Aar = 0.6 fy = 0.6(250) = 150MPa
The anchor rod area is A = 0.7854(0.055)2 = 2.3758 X 10~3 m2 and the spring [using Eq. (13-5)
with 17 = 0°] is
A D C D r AE 2.3758"

3 X 200000 X 10"3 ,
ARSPG = —COST; = L 8 3 x 10.83 ( 1 ) = 2 3 9 7 4 ' 0 k N / m
Try a PZ32 pile section using A-328 steel (Grade 250) with fy = 250 MPa and
fa,P = 0.6 fy = 0.6(250) = 150MPa
and convert table values for / and S for pile width to values per 1 meter of wall width, giving
Moment of inertia/ = - ^ - = 283-J x 10"6 = 0.4934 X 10"3 m4/ni
Width 0.575
Section modulus S = ^ g | = ^ Q ^ 0 ' = 2.605 X 10~3 m3/m

We will use an approximate equation for ks. From Table 4-4 we obtain Hansen bearing-capacity
factors of 8.34, 2.5, and 0.4 at <£ = 10° and compute
AS = 40[cNc + 0.5y(l)(My)]
= 40[20 X 8.34 + 0.5(17.0 - 9.81)(l)(0.4)] = 6673
BS = 40(7.19)(2.5) = 719
Round and use AS = 7000 BS = 1000 (equation is approximate)
Since the dredge line will be excavated, use soil modulus reduction factors (but not for the case
of lost dredge line depth) as
FACl = 0.80 FAC2 = 0.90
We do not want ks to increase much with depth, so use the following equation form (a program
option) instead of Z1:
ks = SK(I) = 7000 + 1000 tan" \Z/D)

where D = embedment depth on any cycle
Z = depth from dredge line to the current node

Referring to Fig. El3-Ia, b, and c, we will make a program execution using DEMB = 1.8 m;
NCYC = 5; NONLIN = 1; and setting all XMAX(I) = 0.5 m.
From this output the nodal displacements XMAX(I) are revised to those shown on the output
sheets (0.010, 0.015, 0.020, 0.022, and the remainder at 0.025). Their significance is shown on
Fig. E13-1*.
Let us somewhat arbitrarily make some additional executions using NCYC = 1; NONLIN = 1;
and for DEMB = 1.8, 2.4, 3.0, and 3.6 m. These executions are summarized in the following table:


Trial

1 2 3 4 5 Units

DEMB, 1.8 1.8 2.4 3.0 3.6 m
SD.L. 13.4 13.6 13.5 13.7 13.6 mm

?max 75.0 76.8 75.3 76.6 76.8 kPa
DEMBx 2.1 1.8 2.4 3.0 3.6 m

F r o m the output sheets for each trial, the m a x i m u m m o m e n t occurs at node 6; qmax occurs at node
10. From the preceding table tentatively select an embedment depth DEMB = 3.0 m. This gives a
reasonable driving depth, and we will consider in the stability analysis a loss of dredge line of 0.6
m (leaving only 2.4 m—for a 1.8-m initial depth the dredge line converged at 2.1 m, which is very
close to 2.4 m). We will also consider the possibility of the surcharge somehow becoming doubled
(from 25 kPa as used above to 50 kPa). Part of this effect might derive from an actual surcharge
increase that increases the lateral pressure; another possibility is that the active pressure might not
fully develop if the anchor rod spring does not stretch sufficiently.
With these considerations a copy of the initial data file is made and named EXl31 .DTA, (on your
diskette). It was edited for depth of embedment DEMB = 3.0, NM = 16 (two bottom elements of
0.6 m added), and NCYC = 1 (we do not want to increment since we already know from using
the 1.8-m depth that convergence is obtained on the first cycle). Use NONLIN = 1 (we do want
to check the dredge line for possible X(9) > XMAX(9) = 0.010 m (10 mm). This set of output is
shown as Fig. E13-1/.
We make copies of file EX131.DTA as EX131A.DTA and EXl3IB.DTA (all on your diskette)
and edit them. EX131A.DTA is edited for a 0.6-m loss of dredge line so that for DEMB = 3.0 -
0.6 = 2.4, we use FACl, FAC2 = 1.0 (not 0.8 and 0.9 of EX131.DTA). We must recompute the
dredge line soil pressure and include nodes 10 and 11. The clay below node 9 produces a disconti-
nuity as shown in Fig. E13-Ic and the two values are "averaged." The other two nodes have values
as shown.
For the surcharge increase from 25 to 50 kPa we edit file EX13IB.DTA for the new pressure
profile (not shown; but at node 1 it is 15.0 instead of 7.5 kPa). Refer to the data file for the pressure
profile if you wish to check it—actually, all values merely increased by 7.5 kPa.
These files were executed and the data are summarized in the following table:

For: Design D.L. loss of 0.6 m Surcharge = 50 kPa
JTSOIL = 9 JTSOIL = 11 JTSOIL = 9
IPRESS = 10 IPRESS = 12 IPRESS = 10

A check of the pile (PZ35) and anchor rod (diam. = 50 mm) stresses yields the following (for
anchor rod include the spacing s):
*•- T - z ^ x i f f x i o . - "41 <150MPa <OK>
1 ^ - I • 1605 Xl6O-' X 103 - 109-9 « 150 MP. (also O.K.)
From the stresses this section appears somewhat overdesigned, however, several considerations
should be made. First, it is a trivial matter to edit the three data files (EX131.DTA, EX131A.DTA,
EXl3IB.DTA) to use a different section (perhaps a PZ27). Second, note the maximum node dis-
placement above the dredge line from the design case of 23.7 (say, 24 mm or 1 in.) is 31.5 (say,
31 mm or 1.25 in.). These displacements are below the water line but may be noticeable. From the
information tabulated, one can say with certainty, without changing sections and making additional
trials, that the displacements would increase with a smaller pile section.
What one should do is to create a more realistic P-X coding using 0.6-m and 0.5-m elements
above the dredge line, and try moving the anchor rod to the new node 4 or 5, and make new execu-
tions.
One might try using either a 35- or 40-mm diameter anchor—but a small diameter rod will in-
crease the lateral displacements above the dredge line. This modification clearly has merit, since
the current rod elongation of 4.4 mm may not be enough to allow active earth pressure, using
as a guide that the wall should translate about 0.001//, giving 0.001(9.0 - 2.4) = 0.001(6.6 X
1000) = 6.6 mm > 4.4 mm. Be careful when considering anchor rod diameter. If the rod is nor-
mally threaded, the actual area is less than the nominal area because the area is calculated to the
thread root (see Table 8-4). If the threads are upset, the actual rod area can be safely used, but a rod
with upset threads costs more.
There is some opinion that the anchor rod force will increase with time as the soil settles from
beneath the rod. The rod then becomes a beam supported at the wall and at the anchorage, and in
addition to the axial anchor rod load it now carries the depth of soil above + its self-weight as a
uniform loading along the rod length. It has been suggested that this long-term loading can nearly
double the initial anchor rod force—in this case from 106.6 to 213 kN—and the allowable stress
would be exceeded.
For the design case we use FACl = 0.8 and FAC2 = 0.9 and calculate the following (note the
use of DEMB = D = 3.0 here):
SK(9) = 0.8[7000 + 1000tan"1 (0.0/3.0)] = 5600. kN/m3
SK(IO) = 0.9[7000 + 1000 tan' '(0.3/3.0)] = 6389.702
SK(Il) = 7000+ 1000tan"1 (0.6/3.0) = 7197.396.. .and so on
For the dredge line loss we use the same equation, but there is a design question of whether it should
have been adjusted for the depth lost—I arbitrarily decided not to since FAC1, FAC2 are taken as
1.0. In this case ks is computed as
SK(JTSOIL) = SK(Il) = (7000 + 0) = 7000. kN/m3
SK(12) = 7000 + tan"1 (0.3/2.4) = 7124.35
SK(13) = 7000+ tan"1 (0.6/2.4) = 7294.979

SK(17) = 7000+ tan"1 (2.4/2.4) = 7785.398
The computer output sheets of Fig. El 3- I/show the final design choice using data set EX131 .DTA
with DEMB = 3.0. Thus, there are several changes from the initial input (different NP, NM). You
should identify the changes from the original input data used for the preliminary trial (not shown).

The final design clearly needs refinement but this will not be done here because of space
limitations.
Discussion of computer output.

1. The program informs you of any recycling based on both NCYC and NONLIN with adequate
identification so you can see what was done.
2. The program puts an * beside any SK(I) that have been reduced (FACl, FAC2 < 1.0). If
FAC 1 = 1 then FAC2 should also equal 1.0, but if either value is 1.0 the * is not printed for that
node.
3. The program puts an * beside nodes where X(I) > XMAX(I) so you can verify (if desired) that
the node reaction is computed as
R = XMAX(I) * K(I) q = XMAX(I) * SK(I)
4. The revised P matrix is output so you can see the effect of inserting the (—) spring force when
X(I) > XMAX(I).
5. The program sums the node soil reactions together with the anchor rod and outputs this value
along with a sum of the active earth node forces so you can make a visual check of X Fh = 0.
6. The moment table is output along with the spring forces and other data so you can make a visual
check that at the ends the element moment is nearly 0 (Node 1 should always be 0 unless the top
is embedded in a concrete slab, as in a pier) and is restrained. Computer round-off error using
single precision may give small nonzero values (exactly 0.000 is shown on the output sheet but
this is unusual).
You can make an instant visual moment check since the far-end moment of element / should
equal the near-end moment of element / + 1 with a sign change. For element 1 the near-end
moment = 0.000; the far-end moment = 6.816; the near-end moment of element 2 = -6.816.
This means that the Z M for node 2 = 0(6.816 - 6.816 = 0) • • • and so on.
7. The output sheet lists a table for plotting. These data are saved to a disk file if specified at the
beginning of program execution. It is always output, however, so you can plot the displacement
profile and superimpose on it the XMAX(I) profile below the dredge line. This file is also useful
to make a quick handplot of the shear and moment diagrams as shown in Fig. El3-Ig. These
diagrams may require interpretation, but this should not be a problem. You know that between
the anchor rod and dredge line the piling bulges outward creating compression on the backfill
side.
The shear (and direction) for node 1 is
y = F1 + F2 = 0.000 + 6.816 = 5 6 8 ^_

The direction derives from using element moment sign conventions. At node 2 (the anchor rod)
we have
VtOp = 5.68 and from element 2
V . ^ - 6 - 8 1 6 ^ - 9 5 0 1 5 ^ -84.859-+
Check this statement as
To left 5^68 + 16701 - 106639 = -84859
This expression says the sum of node forces from the top to node 2— the anchor rod force is
the shear. It is much easier, however, to get the shears directly from V = (F} + F^)Ih but you
need the sign convention for the F1 (element moments), which is shown on Fig. 13-8c.

Figure E13-2a Given wall and soil data.

Example 13-2. It is required to find the embedment depth, anchor rod force, and an adequate sheet
pile section if the dredge line of Example 13-1 has the slope /3 = —15° as shown in Fig. El3-2a.
The figure has been reversed to look from the left, whereas in Fig. 13-Ia we look from the right side
of the wall and parallel along it. The view here matches the profile used in program WEDGE.

Solution. From the several trial runs of Example 13-1 we will tentatively try the embedment depth
of 3 m, use NCYC = 5, and activate NONLIN = 1. We will use FACl = 0.8 and FAC2 = 0.9 for
dredge line damage and the same XMAX(I) values.
We must also adjust ks for the sloping dredge line. For this we will use data sets WDG132A.DTA
and WDGl32B.DTA, provided on your program diskette, with program WEDGE to obtain
PPth = 239.6 kN (horizontal dredge line) and Pp>s = 173.6 kN (sloping dredge line) shown on
Fig. E13-2<2 as well as the force polygon used to find the passive force Pp. Passive force Pp is
horizontal since (j> = 10°, and for this small angle 5 = 0. The resulting reduction factor of 0.725 is

Y = 17.00 kN/m3
7'= 7.19
0 =10°
c =20kPa
Adhesion factor = 0.8
5 = 0°

P =174 scaled (173.69)

computed as shown on Fig. E13-2a. From this and other WEDGE trials, for horizontal dredge lines
it is evident that the p angle for the passive pressure failure surface is pp ^ 45° - 0/2 except for
horizontal, cohesionless backfills with wall 8 = 0. By analogy the active earth-pressure failure
surface is only defined by pa = 45° - <f>/2 for horizontal, cohesionless backfills also with 5 = 0.
The reduction factor RF = 0.725 is applied to values 9 through 17 obtained from a listing of ks —
SK(I) from the output sheet given in Fig. E13-1/. We must input 22 values to allow for NCYC = 5,
so the last five values are computed by hand based on the depth increment DINCR = 0.3 m. With
this calculation we have the following (edited input):

These several node values are input by hand. One could have simply multiplied AS = 7000 X
FACl X RF and BS = 1000 X FAC2 X RF and used the equation; however, the preceding table
illustrates the program option for inputting node values. Actually, considerable efficiency could be
obtained by editing a copy of the data set EX131.DTA to create the data set EX132.DTA for this
example.
The output is shown in Fig. El3-2&, from which we can see the dredge line converged on the
second cycle of NCYC, producing a final embedment depth of 3.0 + 0.3 = 3.3 m. The nonlinear
check also cycled two times: On the first time ICYC = NCYC = 2, and for the second ICYC = 3
since only node 9 displaced such that X(9) > 0.01 m and is marked with an *. The dredge line
displacement stabilized at X(9) = 15.99 mm > XMAX(9) = 10, which is larger than the value
obtained in Example 13-1 of X(9) = 13.7 mm. We would expect that the dredge line displacement
would be larger. It would be even larger for a 20° dredge line slope.
Now one can ask, is this a solution? We look at Pp from the WEDGE program and see it is
173.6 kN. The sum of the node soil reactions that are (+) is written as
6.41 + 19.91 + 19.34 + • • • + 5.91 = 107.93 kN < 173.6
This result indicates the embedment depth for this loading case is satisfactory. In fact, it might be
satisfactory if the sum of soil reactions were larger than 173.6 kN since the bottom two nodes had
(-) displacements (and reactions). The wall could hardly fail in a passive pressure mode (by toe
kickout) with negative node displacements. If all the nodes below the D.L. were (+), we would
have to look at the toe displacement and, if it were more than 1 or 2 mm, increase the embedment
depth DEMB, but this depth appears adequate for this case.
Since the dredge line displacement is larger, the anchor rod force is larger (108.44 vs. 106.64 kN)
than in Example 13-1. The maximum bending moment is also larger (-230.3 vs. — 221.7 kN • m).
There is nothing unexpected in this analysis.
Problems occur if there a loss of dredge line or an increase in backfill surcharge. Both of these
situations may call for an embedment depth larger than the current value of 3.0 m. The analysis is
left as an exercise for the reader.

Example 13-3.

Given, The sheet-pile wall system of Fig. E13-3a, which is supporting 5 m of sand backfill over-
lying 6 m of clay. Sand data are estimated as shown, and qu was obtained from SPT tests. We will use
two anchor rods: one is placed above the water level; the lower one uses a drilled tie-back system
and can be installed at low tide. From trials not shown, we tentatively choose a PZ40 sheet-pile
section.

Required, Design the wall (at least the first cycle of the iterative design process).

Solution.
Step 1. Locate the nodes as in Fig. El3-3/?; from these we can readily establish NP, NM, node soil
starts JTSOIL, etc. as shown.
Step 2. Compute the earth-pressure profile using the Coulomb Ka, with 8 = 17°, and /3=0. This
calculation gives Ka = 0.277 (from Table 11-1). The value of 8 is an engineering estimate and
generally ranges from about 0.5 to 0.7</>. We use a 17° value here because only the upper 5 m of
wall is sand. A larger friction value may not develop because of the deeper clay backfill. Also Ka
only varies from 0.278 to 0.275 as 8 varies from 16 to 22°, so is not very sensitive in the likely range
of wall friction angle.
However, there is wall adhesion in the underlying 6 m of clay, both from its being below the
water table and because there is the sand acting as a surcharge to keep the clay squeezed against
the wall.
Using the methods given in Chap. 11 for lateral pressure computations, we obtain the pressure
profile of Fig. E13-3c with the following supplemental explanation. At the junction of the sand and
clay layers at the water line,
o-a,s = [20 + 17.9(5)]0.277 = 30.33 kPa
In the clay Ka = 1.0, so we have
o-a,c = [20 + 17.9(5)]1.0 - 2c T L = 48.5 kPa
Averaging for input gives
^ = 3 0 3 + 4 8 ^ 3 ^

Below the water line for the rest of clay,
cTaiC = 48.5 + y'zKa = 48.5 + 11.Oz
At the dredge line
aac = 48.5 H- 11(6) = 114.5 kPa
Step 3. Obtain the moment of inertia per meter of wall width for the PZ40 section. From Appendix
A-3a, we find
/ = 335.23 X 10"6 m4 for w = 500 mm :
/ = **!** = 670.0 x 10~6 iriYm
E = 200 000 MPa
Step 4. Compute anchor rod springs per meter of wall width from the spacing of 3 m and using a
rod length so the anchor is out of "active" zone (and from Example 13-2 we found we do not really
know where this zone is when there is cohesive soil involved). What we will do is use program
WEDGE, a wall height from the dredge line to the top of the clay, an adhesion factor of 0.8, and the
sand calculated as a surcharge of

We now have a dilemma. If we directly compute the active force, we have
CTa = (qs + Uz) ~2C
f6
Pp = CTadz
Jo
Integrating and inserting limits, we have
Pp = 109.5(6) + ll(6)2/2 - 2(30.5)(6) = 489 kN
If we use program WEDGE, we obtain this value exactly at the Rankine p = 45° + 0°/2 = 45°.
On the other hand, if we use a wall adhesion of 0.8c, we obtain
Pp = 363.93 kN at p = 37°
This latter value is probably more nearly correct and is used to plot the p angle of Fig. E13-3a
for the clay. The conventional value of p = 45° + 32°/2 = 61° is used for the sand. This p value
is necessary to locate the anchor block.
The anchor block for anchor rod 1 must be located far enough from the wall so that the passive
wedge (p = 45°-32°/2 = 29°) does not intersect the active wedge from the wall. A scaled drawing
should be made so that the several control dimensions can be plotted and required distances scaled.
This approach tends to reduce computation errors. This plotting is shown on Fig. El3-3«. The design
of the anchor block is considered in the next section.
Anchor 2 uses a drilled hole with grout in the zone outside the active wedge zone. The hole
diameter and grout length are design parameters taken up in Sec. 13-8.
The rod diameter can be set here. After several trials, we select tentative anchor rod diameters
of 40 mm for each. From scaling the drawing one obtains these lengths for the anchors:
No. 1 = 14.2 m
No. 2 = 5.25 m (only the ungrouted length that is free to elongate in the drill hole)
From these lengths and using 40-mm rod diameters (Ar = 0.7854(0.040)2 = 0.001 257 m2) we
obtain
ARSPRG(I) = ^- = ° - 0 0 1 T X™X1* = 5901.4kN/m/m
sL 3 X 14.2
ARSPRG(2) = ° - Q O 1 2 f X ^ O X 106COS20° = 14999.3 kN/m/m
Step 5. Take ks = 40(SF)ga; it was shown in Chap. 4 that within reasonable accuracy qa = qu with
SF = 3. Thus, k5 = 40(3X61) = 7320 -* 7300 kN/m3. Use this value in the equation format of
AS = 7300; BS = 0; and arbitrarily use FACl = 0.70 and FAC2 = 0.85.
Step 6. With these data a file EX133.DTA is built (and on your diskette) and executed to obtain the
output shown on Fig. El 3-3d.
Perform an output check as follows.

1. Sum of spring forces = 607.41 kN versus input forces computed from the input soil pressures
of 607.39 kN -> Z ^ = 0.
2. Dredge line node 10 (JTSOIL), node 11, and node 12 all have displacements as follows:

Figure E13-3d (continued)


Nodes 10, 11, and 12 are marked with an asterisk (*) on Fig. E13-3d for rapid identification
that X > XMAX(I). The anchor rod forces and pile moments include the effect of this nonlinear
check.
3. The maximum sheet-pile moment of 451.10 kN-m occurs at node 9, and the bending stress is
computed as
fs = M/S = 451.10/5
S = 1 6 3 2 J 0 1 0 " - 0.003 264 mVm
and inserting values (103 converts kN to MN) obtain
^ = 0 . 0 0 3 4 2 6 4 x l 0 3 - 1 3 8 - 2 M P a < / -
This stress is satisfactory for A328 steel with fy = 250 MPa and an allowable bending stress of
fa = 0.65 fy = 160MPa.
4. The anchor rod stresses (based on the 3-m spacing s) are next checked:
Rod 1: Ar = 0.001 257 m2 P = 39.53* = 39.53 X 3.0 = 118.59 kN
P 11R SQ
£ = _£_ = 11^1 = 94.34 MPa (since 10"3 X 103 = 1.0)
r\.r 1.ZJ /
(O.K. for fy = 250 MPa grade steel)
Rod 2: P = /Vcos 20° = 346.11 X 3/cos20° = 1105.OkN

The stress in anchor 2 is so high it would require using either a larger rod diameter or using
high-strength rods or cables as used for prestressed concrete. If you try a larger rod diameter,
you must recompute the spring and rerun the problem.
5. Check the computed soil pressures. The output sheet shows the soil pressures for critical nodes
as follows:

Node q, kPa qa, kPa

11 74.5 61
12 102.2 61
13 111.5 61
14 81.8 61

These soil pressures are not failure values, for qu\t is theoretically on the order of 3 X 61 =
183 kPa. Also the passive earth force is 415.4 kN, which is greater than the sum of the (+)
soil reactions from the dredge line of 234.5 kN. Note that the bottom two nodes kick back
[(-) X(I)] into the backfill. Considering these two data items, the wall should be stable for this
load case. The only problem is that anchor rod No. 2 may require a larger diameter rod and/or
use of prestressed steel cables.
Summary

1. The dredge line soil appears adequate.
2. The sheet-pile section seems satisfactory.


3. Anchor rod No. 2 may be overstressed. It may require a larger diameter rod or use of very-high-
strength steel cable. Another possibility is to see if it can be relocated to a lower depth.
4. Anchor rod No. 1 appears overdesigned, but you can check by using a 30-mm diameter rod to
see what happens.

The next example is a cantilever retaining wall The basic difference between the anchored
and cantilever wall is that the latter does not use an anchor rod. Another difference is that
the cantilever wall is usually limited in height to about 3 to 4 m because without an anchor
very large translation X(I) values result, that produce large bending moments. The principal
advantage in not using an anchor is economy since the anchor, anchorage, and installation
costs are considerable. Adjacent property owners may not allow entry to install anchorage. In
those cases where a cantilever wall is higher than 3 to 4 m it may be necessary to use some of
the special sections shown in Fig. 13-6. Since some of these built-up sections are more than
1 m in width, it is necessary to divide by their width to obtain the unit width values for use
in these analyses.

Example 13-4. Make a tentative design for the cantilever wall shown in Figs. E13-4a, b, and c.

Solution,
Step 1. Do the necessary coding and compute the node pressures to the dredge line as shown in the
figures. Note that several preliminary executions were made so that the output could be minimized.
From the preliminary trials it appears that a PZ27 section can be used. The resulting moment of
inertia is

Step 2. An initial embedment depth DEMB = 4.0 m is chosen (based on previous trials) with
NCYC = 1 and NONLIN = 1 so the embedment depth is not increased. The soil below the dredge
line is checked for any X(I) > XMAX(I). Most cantilever walls will require an embedment depth
D ~ height of wall above the D.L.
Step 3. Obtain the modulus of subgrade reaction ks. Since the soil is layered it will be best to input
node values that are hand-computed. The first two nodes will be reduced by FACl, FAC2 as shown
following.
For the sand, we use the bearing-capacity equation and obtain from Table 4-4 for Hansen's equa-
tion the following:
For <f> = 32° : Nq = 23.2; N7 = 20.8
ks = 40[16.50(23^)Z1 + 0.5(16.5)(1.0)(20.8)]
ks = SK(I) = 6864 + 15 312Z1 -* 6800 + 15 300Z (rounding)
Using these values we obtain the following (Note: The first two nodes are reduced using FACl,
FAC2):
For node 1: SK(I) = 0.7(6800 + 0.) = 4760 kN/m3
node 2: SK(2) = 0.8[6800 + 15 300(0.5)] = 11560
node 3: SK(3) = 6800 + 15 300(1) = 22100
node 4: SK(I) = 6800 + 15 300(1.5) = 29750
but node 4 is interfaced with the clay.


Figure E13-4a-c

For the clay use ks = 40(SF)qa, but qa = qu with SF = 3.0. With these values we find
ks = SK(I) = 40(3)(40) = 4800 kN/m3
We calculate an average SK(3) as
(29750 + 4800)/2 = 17275 kN/m3
For SK(4) through end of SK(I) the value is 4800 kN/m3.
Step 4. With the preceding data for moment of inertia XI(I), SK(I), and the control parameters
shown on the figure, data file EX134.DTA is created (also on your diskette). The execution gives
Fig. E13-4J from which we can make the following observations:
a. The final depth D/ = D1 = 4.0 m, which appears adequate. Five nodes have (-) displacement
toward the backfill side. Three nodes have a (+) displacement, and node 5 has X(5) = 7.9 mm
> XMAX(5) of 6.0 mm—it is marked with an * for rapid notice.
b. The displacement of the top (node 1) is 33.983 mm, which may be noticeable. It can only be
reduced by using a stiffer section or by using an anchorage of some type.
c. The maximum bending moment occurs at node 7 (not at dredge line node 5) and is 72.18 kN-m.
For fy = 250 MPa the allowable stress fa = 0.65 fy = 0.65(250) = 162.5 MPa. The section
modulus of the PZ27 is

Is this wall overdesigned? If the client will accept a much larger displacement at node 1, it may
be possible to use a PZ22. It probably is not necessary to increase the embedment depth. It may
be prudent to place a surcharge on the backfill of about 20 kPa and rerun the program to see if the
embedment depth and section are still adequate. If they are not it may be necessary to increase the
embedment by another 0.5 m and/or use a stiffer section. This latter check is your stability analysis.

13-8 ANCHOR RODS, WALES, AND ANCHORAGES
FOR SHEETPILING
This section will consider additional factors in the design of anchored sheet-pile walls.

13-8.1 Anchor Rods
The FEM analysis for the anchored sheet-pile walls of Examples 13-1, 13-2, and 13-3 il-
lustrated that the design of the anchor rods is closely associated with the total design. That
is, we must assume some size rod6 and its length. From this an anchor rod spring (AE/L) is
computed as part of the input data.
The program output gives an anchor force for that anchor section used, and the following
criteria must be met:

1. The anchor node displacement must be large enough that active earth pressure can develop
behind the wall. This S is usually on the order of 0.001/f, where H is the free height from
the dredge line to the anchor rod node.
2. The allowable tensile stress

fs- —-fa

where fa = 0.6 to 0.75fy. The factors to reduce fy to the allowable stress fa are the
necessary rod safety factor for that anchor rod force Far.

The force (and the pile bending moment) also depends on anchor rod location (analyses not
shown). Thus, in a design one must first try a given node as in Example 13-1 until a reasonable
solution seems to be found. Then one shifts the anchor rod location if this is possible and
makes additional trials to attempt to find the lightest pile section and smallest-diameter anchor
rod consistent with the given wall specifications + any stability cases checked.
There are several complications to consider in addition to the foregoing two basic consid-
erations:

1. If the soil beneath the anchor settles away from the rod it becomes unsupported and must
carry its self-weight + any fraction of the upper soil assigned to the rod as a strip load.

6Although the term rods is used and implies a round solid bar, in practice the rod may be either a rod or a large
wire strand cable.


Usually there is some arching, so the full column of soil over the rod may not bear on it;
however, a small-diameter rod in a long span can develop significant bending moments
just from self-weight. A small-diameter rod will have a very small section modulus 5, so
the increase in the tension stresses from bending can be substantial.
2. It has been suggested that one should put a negative camber into the rod, using seating
blocks (or props), in anticipation of rod sag from item 1. This may be difficult to do since
backfill placed over the rod and the several seating blocks would cause settlement of both
the underlying soil and the blocks themselves. Seating blocks may be practical in original
ground, but this is seldom where the anchor rod is located.
3. Some persons suggest placing the anchor rod in a hollow tube that is supported by the
backfill so that the rod is initially unsupported. This method is a solution only if the tube
containing the rod does not settle into (or with) the fill.

13-8.2 Wales
Wales are longitudinal members running parallel with and in close contact with the wall, as
shown in Fig. 13-9. They may be located on either the front or back face of the wall. The back
face location is desirable in certain cases for both appearance and clearance, but it will require
both a work space and adequate attachment to the wall by bolting or welding to support the
anchor rod pull. Back face wales are most often attached by field-welding.
Bolting is difficult for either face location, since bolt holes shop-drilled in the sheetpiling
by the steel fabricator seldom align with the wale after the piles are driven. On the other hand
it is very difficult to field-drill large-diameter bolt holes in the driven piles using hand drills.
Wales on the front face are somewhat easier to install but also require a hole through the
wall for the anchor rod—usually made by burning with an acetylene torch. Again, shop holes
for bolting are not practical; however, here the wale usually covers the hole, so ragged edges
of burned holes are not noticeable.
Wales are usually made from a pair of back-to-back channels with spacing for the anchor
rod. Sometimes a pair of I beams is used; however, W shapes having wide flanges are not
suitable unless the flanges are braced so they do not bend.
It is usually permissible to use large bending stresses—as much as 0.9 fy in the wales;
however, the wales must be sufficiently rigid to transfer the anchor force laterally over the
anchor spacings s (of Fig. 13-9c) to satisfy the mathematical model. If there is very much
lateral displacement between anchor spacings, most of the anchor force will be concentrated
at the anchor. At best, this effect produces an unsightly wall, but more importantly soil moves
into those "bulged" regions and backfill settlements occur. This causes pavement cracks; and
if structures are near the wall they may crack and even collapse. Thus, anchor rod spacing 5
is a significant design parameter.
Since wale fixity is fairly certain only at the anchor points, it is usual to use the assumptions
shown in Fig. 13-9c. The wales are assumed to carry a uniform load w of intensity shown,
and if we assume an approximate fixed end beam the bending moment at any anchor point
(which will be the maximum) is
WS2 WS2

M ~ — or —

Usually the larger of the two approximations is used.


Figure 13-9 Wale location and design.

Web crippling should be checked at the anchor locations as shown in Fig. 13-9Z?, for very
high stresses can develop from the anchor rod force. Web crippling can be checked using the
procedure given by the AISC (1989 or later) ASD manual.

Example 13-5. Tentatively design wales for the lower anchor rod of Example 13-3 assuming
the output is satisfactory. Consider a typical wale section on an interior span of s = 3 m as in
Fig. El3-5. Try to use a pair of channels back to back with fy = 250 MPa (A-36). From the com-
puter output (Fig. El3-3J) the axial anchor rod force per meter was found to be
Far = 346.11/cos20o = 368.32 kN/m
Solution, The anchor rod force per meter is the uniform pressure on the wale. Using the previously
given moment approximation, compute the following

Using an allowable bending stress of 0.75/y provides a nominal SF = 1/0.75 = 1.33 and fa =

For a single channel

Sx = ^ 4 5 x 1 0 - 3 = Q g 7 2 3 x 10_3 m 3

From tables of rolled sections in metric units in the AISC (1992) manual we find the largest available
channel is the only section that can be used:

Use C380 X 74 : d = 381 mm bf = 94.4 mm tw = 18.2
(C15 x 50): tf = 16.5 k = 37.0 mm
Sx = 0.882 X 10"3 m3 Ix = 168 X 10~6 m4

beam with an L = 3 m:

A c = 384 x 200 x 106 x (2 X 168 x 10^) = U 6 X 10~ = U 6 m m
This displacement is quite adequate.
2. Check web yielding and crippling under the anchor plate, which is somewhat limited in area.
To cover the two channel flanges and leave a 45-mm space for the 40-mm diameter anchor rods
assumed in Example 13-3, a cover plate width (Fig. El3-5) will have to be

For channel web yield, check an end anchor where the contributory length = s/2 = 3/2 =

The AISC [9th ed., ASD, Eq. (Kl-3)] equation is

Substituting values (N = wp = 235 mm; from above, k = 37 mm; tw = 18.2 mm; and previ-
ously fy = 250 MPa) we obtain
I = 0.66 X 250 X 103 X 0.0182(0.235 + 2.5 X 0.037) = 983.5 kN > 552.5
Web yielding in the channel is clearly adequate.
3. Check channel web crippling using AISC [9th ed., ASD, Eq. (KlS)]. The equation is
I = CtI 1 + 3 (7 Yjj) JUffc (Per channel)
where C = 89 for ends and 176.7 for interior nodes. Since the end node is more critical, use
C = 89 and substitute (1000 kN/MN) to obtain
I = 34 X 0.01822 [~l + 3 № V | | | J'51 7250(16.5/18.2) X 1000
P = 89 x 0.01822[3.14] X 15.05 X 1000 X 2 = 2986 » 2(552.5)
For interior nodes P = 2786(176.7)/89 = 5531 » 2(552.5).
Web crippling is not a critical design item here.

13-8,3 Sheet-Pile Anchorages
Anchorage for sheet piles may be obtained from large cast-in-place concrete blocks (usually
square and of necessary length) or precast concrete blocks that are embedded in the soil some
depth (Fig. 13-10a). Instead of using a concrete block of some length, a row of sheetpiling
that is similar to the supported wall but of shorter length may be driven, as in Fig. 13- 1Od;
alternate pairs may be driven deeper for additional stability. As shown, a wale is used to carry
the anchor rod force.
Piles may be driven as in Fig. 13-10Z? and c, and some authorities suggest these are the
most reliable of the several anchorages. A surface paved with concrete may be extended (with
edge thickened and reinforced) to provide an encasement for the top node region of the sheet
pile instead of using a top anchor. This generally fixes the top against both translation and
displacement and is efficiently handled with the FEM program using boundary conditions.
Top fixity may reduce the pile bending moments, but the results depend on an interaction of
wall height, pile stiffness, and whether the node is both fixed for no rotation and translation
or just fixed for no translation.

TIEBACKS. One of the most popular anchorage methods presently used is the tieback of Fig.
13-10e. These are essentially small piles oriented at about 17 = 15 to 25° from the horizontal.


Figure 13-10 Sheet pile anchorages: (a) Cast-in-place anchor block; (b, c) pile configurations used as anchorages;
(d) short sheet-pile wall used as anchorage; (e) tie-back anchor.

By using small slopes the vertical stress component on the wall can be neglected. Tiebacks are
constructed by drilling a hole on the order of 150 to 375 mm in diameter using a hollow-stem
auger. The anchor cable or rod, with an expandable end plate (or toggle), is pushed or carried
in the hollow stem of the auger and at the design depth is extruded. Then the end plate/toggle
is expanded. The end plate greatly increases the pull-out resistance of the anchor from the
concrete shaft. The auger is slowly withdrawn, and simultaneously concrete or sand-cement
grout (with either material containing appropriate admixtures), usually of about fc! ~ 21
MPa, is forced through the hollow stem. The concrete/grout is under a pressure of from 75
to 225 kPa so that it expands around the cable/rod for bond and against the soil to produce

an irregular surface for friction/adhesion. A grouting pressure is used to approximate K*
conditions so that the soil-anchor friction angle 5 -» <f> or, if cohesive, an adhesion such that
Ca-> C.
High-strength steel (fy on the order of 1000 to 14 000 MPa) tendons or rods are generally
used for tieback anchors because they are usually prestressed to a design force computed
using methods of the next chapter. High-strength steel is used instead of regular structural
steel with an fy = 250 MPa (A36) so that after soil creep and steel relaxation occur there is
a substantial holding force remaining in the "tieback."
Tieback walls are often used in deep excavations where it is essential that lateral wall
movements and subsequent perimeter settlements be minimized. An advantage of these walls
is they can be constructed from the top down (built as excavation proceeds). Another advan-
tage is they do not produce obstructions in the construction area. Often these walls are left in
place and become part of the final construction.
They have the disadvantages that adjacent property owners must give permission and that
underground utilities must not be encountered.
Only a part of the drilled depth is backfilled with concrete. A part must be left free so
that the anchor cable can elongate (with no length in which to develop e = PL/AE, it would
pull apart). The force used to develop the prestress is always larger than the design force (the
designer knows the soil will creep and the steel will relax), so effectively the anchor is proof
tested during installation. If the rod or cable does not pull apart or the assembly pull out, the
design is adequate.
The tieback anchor design can be made with reference to Fig. 13-10e as
Par = TrDL[Jd2K tan 8 + ca] (13-7)

where D = average shaft diameter; compute based on volume of concrete pumped,
together with the original and final hole depths, m or ft
L = length of cement/grout; compute based on original and final hole depth,
m or ft
K = soil coefficient—between Ka and K0
d2 - average depth of grouted length L, m or ft
8 = soil-cement friction coefficient and —> <f>
ca = adhesion to cement zone—0.7 to LOc, kPa or ksf

If the anchorage is belled, you can use Eq. (4-25).
Additional details on prestressed anchors may be found in PCI (1974), Ware et al. (1973),
and Oosterbaan and Gifford (1972). The methodology is well-established, so there is a
scarcity of very recent publications.

Example 13-6. Tentatively size the concrete shaft of the tie-back anchor of Example 13-3 for the
anchor force of 3(368.32) = 1104.96 kN (refer to Figs. E13-3a and E13-5 for other data).

Solution. Try a 350-mm nominal anchor shaft diameter. Take adhesion as 0.8su(su = qu/2 =
61/2 = 30.5 kPa). Assume that CU conditions will be obtained around the shaft perimeter from the
pressure grouting. This state will produce a small angle of internal friction of about 4> = 20°. We
will also assume the grout pressure produces K0 conditions so that K = K0 = 1 - sin 20° = 0.66
and the friction angle 8 = <f) = 20°.


We are making this design with less than ideal soil data—often the case in practice. In the absence
of better data we do the best we can. Proof loading of the anchor will quickly indicate if the design
is inadequate. With these estimates we will use Eq. (13-7):
Par = TrDL[yd2Kten8 + ca]
From a scale drawing of Fig. E13-3a we obtain a tentative vertical average distance d2 « 10 m
(we may have to make more than one trial to obtain compatible d2 and embedment length L). Five
meters of this depth is sand to the water line; the remaining 5 m is clay soil below the water line,
requiring using y' = 20.8 - 9.8 = 11.0 kN/m3. Substituting values into Eq. (13-7) we obtain
Par = L(TT X 0.350) [(5 X 17.9 + 5.0 X H)(0.66 x tan20°) + 0.8 x 30.5]
= L(1.10) [(144.5X0.2402) + 24.4]
= L(1.10)(34.7 + 24.4) = L(65.01)
Since axial Pa1. = 3(368.32) = 1104.96 kN, solving for L gives

The total anchor rod/cable L tot = 5.25 + 17.00 = 22.2 m. The vertical force/meter of wall Fv =
368.32 sin 20° = 126.0 kN. This value of L is reasonably consistent with d2 used, so we may take
this as a valid solution—unless the anchor fails during installation.

BLOCK7 ANCHORS. The block anchor is a cast-in-place or precast concrete member that
may be square or rectangular in section with the necessary length to develop adequate passive
resistance for one or more anchor rods/cables attached along its length.
A general equation can be developed for a block anchor using Fig. 13-1IZ? and noting that
P'a may not fully develop unless the anchor translates toward the wall a small amount, and
P'p similarly may not fully develop unless there is sufficient translation. For these reasons the
values are given primed superscripts. With this understood, we obtain the general equation
as follows:
^Fh = Fv- L(P'p -P'a + Ftop + F ^ )
Solving and including an SF, we obtain
L(P'p + Ftop + Fb o t - P'a)
P31 = — U^-o;

Use an SF of about 1.2 to 1.5 in this equation, depending on the importance factor. Assuming
that P'p, P'a should be collinear, we can take X Mpp = 0, giving
B'LP' + B1LFR + (H - y)LFm = F^e + yLFboi
Rearranging and solving for vertical corner force P\ we obtain
P, = ^l + yJ^_(n-m0P_FR (13.8a)

7The block anchor is also called a "deadman." Rather than amending that term to "deadperson," this text will call
these members "block anchors."

and the force P' located at point b' must be
P ' < (qsm + Jd1)L
Refer to Fig. 13-1 Ib for identification of terms used in the preceding equations and note
that Far = total anchor rod force based on spacing 5* and that Fi, FR = side friction (FR =
P'a tan S) forces. For the preceding equations use L = s for anchorages that are continuous for
the total wall length—the usual case. Earth pressures are usually calculated for a unit width
so they must be multiplied by L to obtain forces consistent with the anchor rod.
When using Eq. (13-8), one should locate the anchorage so that the passive zone of
Fig. 13-1IJ and Example 13-3 is outside the active wedge. Actually the anchorage can be
in the reduced efficiency zone of Fig. 13-lid but with a passive pressure computed using d\
reduced by the depth of the intersection of the passive and active zones (similar to point C
of Fig. 13-lld). For this case the top and bottom friction/adhesion components must provide
the principal anchor rod resistance.
Regardless of anchorage location the anchorage must be carefully backfilled both around
the sides and on top so that the assumed passive condition with friction and/or adhesion can
develop. There may be a question of using an SF on the active pressure component of
Eq. (13-8), but this is a conventional procedure that has generally proved satisfactory.

A few verification tests have been made—primarily on small models but a few on full-
scale anchorages [see Smith (1957) and Tschebotarioff (1962)]. From these the following
semi-empirical equations were produced:

1. If the anchorage is a short rectangular (or square) block of L < 1.5//, the anchor resistance
can be computed (see Fig. 13-11« or c) as

P. - *•*"%*** (13-9)

In this equation take Kp = Rankine value from Table 11-4. Use a SF = 1.2 to 1.5. Take
C ~ 0.65 for concrete; for steel plates or sheetpiling use C ~ 0.5.
2. For a cohesive soil (0 = 0°) compute the anchorage resistance as
P. - * g j * (13-10)

where M = 9 for — > 3 (9 = bearing capacity factor for a deep footing)
H
= 9-^ for -^ < 3 (using linear interpolation)
H H
d,2 = block depth shown on Fig. 13-11«

3. For (f)-c soil and L > 1.5// use Eq. (13-8) with the active and passive earth forces com-
puted using Eqs. (2-54) and (2-55); for short anchor blocks use

Par ^ ^ (13-11)

When the anchor block is very deep, say d^jH > 6.5, one may compute the anchor resis-
tance by Eq. (13-9) for all values of L.

Example 13-7. Design a concrete anchorage for the anchor rod force and its location of Example
13-1.
Given. Far = 106.6 kN on s = 3 m (see Fig. E13-1/)
Depth Ji = 1.2 m (see Fig. E13-Ia)
y = 16.50 kN/m3 qsm = 25 kPa (see Fig. E13-la)
0 = 32° Concrete: /c' = 21 MPa

Solution. We know that a soil with <j> = 32° will have a reasonably large passive earth and friction
resistance. Let us try a block of 0.6 X 0.6 m X length of the wall; but for any interior anchorage
the effective length L = 3 m and is 1.5 m for the two ends (but the two ends will also have end
friction). We will look at a typical interior section having these properties:
Dimensions = 0.6 X 0.6 X 3.0 m length
Anchor rod force = sFar = 3 X 106.6 = 319.8 kN
For friction we will use 8 = 25° for top
8 = <f> = 32° for base


Using a smaller 8 for the.block top is justified on the basis that it will not be so rough as the
sides, which are cast against the soil; also top will be backfill. With these data we compute block
friction resistance as follows:
Ftop = L(qSUT + y d\) tan 25°
= 3(25 + 16.5 X 1.2) tan 25° = 3(20.9) = 62.7 kN
Fbot = 3(25 + 16.5 X 1.8) tan32° = 3(34.2) = 102.5 kN
Using the Coulomb (same as Rankine) pressure coefficients with 5 = 0 and (/> = 32°, we obtain,
from Table 11-1, Ka = 0.307; from Table 11-2, Kp = 3.25.
The active and passive earth forces on the block can be computed from the average block pressure
as follows:
<7av = (q + havy)Kt : <ra = (25 + 1.5 X 16.5)0.307 = 15.3 kPa
(Tp = (25 + 1.5 X 16.5)3.25 = 161.7 kPa
P1 = LX o-,-av X H where L = 3 m, H = 0.6 m
Pa = 3 X 15.3X0.6 = 27.5 kN
Pp = 3 X 161.7 X 0.6 = 291.1 kN
The total resisting force is
FR = Ftop + Fhot + P'p-P'a
= 62.7 + 102.5 + 291.1 - 27.5 = 428.8 kN
and the resulting SF is
SF = g = !?H = 1.34 (probably O.K.)

We do not check the eccentricity of the anchor rod with P'p but it is probably rather small. Instead,
this question is left as a reader exercise (Prob. 13-16).

13-9 OVERALL WALL STABILITY
AND SAFETY FACTORS
A sheet-pile wall can fail in one of four basic modes as shown in Fig. 13-12:

1. Sheet-pile bending. Using the maximum design moment M from the analysis with fa ~
0.60 to 0.65 fy gives an apparent SF = 1.66 to 1.54, which is usually adequate. One may,
of course, use a smaller or larger fa based on site conditions and the importance factor.
Safety factors much smaller than 0.5 are not recommended.
If there is enough lateral displacement (or bending) the pile may pull out of the ground,
for it cannot elongate.
2. Anchor rod or anchorage failure. This may be by the anchor rod pulling apart either along
its length or failing at its anchor point(s). For the anchor rod one should limit the allowable
stress so that a SF on the order of 1.5 to 2.0 is obtained.
Anchorage failure can occur if passive pressure and friction resistance is inadequate.
This would occur from placing the block too close to the wall, combined with inadequate
backfilling procedures.
3. A toe (or kickout) failure. This may occur if the embedment depth is not adequate. This
failure mode is usually checked by taking a moment summation about one of the anchor


rods. When this is done the X ^ar should be for a worst case, not for the basic design
case. Actually, this check is not required in the FEM since it is automatically satisfied for
any design case checked.
4. A system (see Fig. 13-12Z?) failure. This failure mode is usually checked using a slope
stability program with trial circles located such that they are outside the anchorages for the
anchor rods and pass either through or just below the pile tip. A minimum recommended
SF for this mode is 1.2+.
The zone between the active earth-pressure wedge and the anchorage is similar to a rein-
forced earth system. The major difference is the use of only one or two anchor rods versus a
number of reinforcement strips. Thus, it would appear that no slip circles would form in this
region.
Some persons suggest that a vertical or "plunging" failure by excessive pile penetration be
investigated when the anchor rod slopes. It is not likely that the active pressure would force
the piling further into the ground; however, when the anchor uses a prestress tendon that is
tensioned to a high value, a fairly large vertical force can be developed. The problem with
this type of analysis is that, as the large vertical force develops, there is also an increase in the
horizontal force and in the friction component and (depending on the soil) there is additional
adhesion, so it is nearly impossible to make any kind of analysis. If plunging is a problem,
it will be discovered during the application of the proof load—one can see the wall moving
vertically and stop operations for a redesign. Probably the best solution is to increase the
embedment depth, since that zone has friction and/or adhesion on both sides of the piling.

PROBLEMS
13-1. Use your FEM program FADSPABW (B-9) and find an embedment depth for an HP pile section
(see Table A-I of Appendix A) for the "flagpole" problem summarized in Table Pl3-1 and
illustrated in Fig. P13-1. After the program finds a depth, indicate what you recommend for the
depth and your reasons. In this case input IPRESS = 0, NNZP = 1, BSHP = width of HP,
m, and the horizontal load P at NP = 2.

Note: In the following problems, if you input something that does not produce a stable structural
system, the program will likely cancel, and you will not get all of the output. If this occurs, you
must edit the change to something larger or stiffer or increase the embedment depth.
13-2. Redo Example 13-1 with 0.6- and 0.5-m element lengths above the dredge line and see if there
are any major differences in nodal output compared with Fig. E13-1/.
13-3. Make a stability analysis of Example 13-1 using data sets EX131A.DTA and EX131B.DTA.
Using the worst-case anchor rod load, check if the anchor rod is adequate. Using the largest
moment, check if the bending stress is satisfactory.
13-4. Using data set EX131C.DTA (it is already set to fix node 1 and remove the anchor rod), make
an analysis and compare the output to that from using data set EX131.DTA. Draw a sketch
showing the bending moment caused by fixity (and sign) and compute the equivalent anchor
force produced by fixing the node.
13-5. Redo Example 13-2 (sloping dredge line) but take the dredge line slope as 25°. Use program
WEDGE and data sets WDG132A.DTA and WDG132B.DTA (with WDGl32B.DTA revised
for the new slope angle). Recompute the SK(I) values below the dredge line and make an anal-
ysis using program B-9. Compare the output from your analysis with the execution using data
setEX132.DTA.
13-6. Redo Example 13-2 using a revised copy of data set EX132.DTA for a surcharge of 50 kPa
on the backfill. Check whether the bending moment stress and anchor stress are satisfactory. If
they are not try these:
a. A stiffer sheet-pile section
b. A larger-diameter anchor rod
13-7. Redo Example 13-2 using a revised copy of data set EX132.DTA. Move the anchor rod to the
water line node (be sure that you are using 0.6- and 0.5-m nodes above the dredge line) and see
if there is sufficient improvement to warrant movement. Be sure to check the new anchor and
bending stresses.
13-8. Redo Example 13-3 using a copy of data set EX133.DTA, edited to use a larger-diameter rod
for the top anchor. Compare these results to your execution of the original data set and note
whether there is any improvement.

13-9. Redo Example 13-3 using a copy of data set EX133.DTA but with the rod springs reversed (i.e.,
just switch the two K values). Compare this output to your execution of the original data set.
13-10. Redo Example 13-3 using a copy of data set EX133A.DTA that fixes the top node (NZX = 2)
and uses only the lower anchor. Compare this output to that from using the original data set.
Are any bending moments too large? Is the anchor rod overstressed?
13-11. Redo Example 13-3 using a copy of data set EX133.DTA and increase the surcharge to 40 kPa.
Check if the bending and anchor stresses are adequate.
13-12. Redo Example 13-4 using a copy of data set EX134.DTA and the next larger sheet-pile section.
How much does this larger section reduce the top node displacement?
13-13. Redo Example 13-4 using a copy of data set EX134.DTA and adding a surcharge of 20 kPa to
the backfill. By trial find a section that limits the top node deflection to not more than 35 mm.
13-14. Redo Example 13-5 with a diameter of 375 mm and see if there is any significant change in
anchor elongation.
13-15. Design the wales for the anchor rod of Example 13-1 using the data in Fig. E13-1/. You should
obtain a regular copy using data set EX131.DTA, which will be easier to read and work with.
Use a pair of back-to-back channels with adequate spacing for the anchor rod to fit between in
a loose fit.
13-16. For Example 13-6, find the eccentricity e and compute the vertical force P' (at b'). Use FR =
P'a tan 32°, note there is a surcharge on the backfill, and be sure to include L.

WALLS FOR EXCAVATIONS

14-1 CONSTRUCTION EXCAVATIONS
It is a legal necessity with any new construction to provide protection to the adjacent struc-
tures when excavating to any appreciable depth. Without adequate lateral support the new
excavation will almost certainly cause loss of bearing capacity, settlements, or lateral move-
ments to existing property.
New construction may include cut-and-cover work when public transportation or public
utility systems are installed below ground and the depth is not sufficient to utilize tunneling
operations. The new construction may include excavation from depths of 1 to 2O+ m below
existing ground surface for placing any type of foundation from a spread footing to a mat, or
for allowing one or more subbasements.
All of this type of construction requires installation of a lateral retaining system of some
type before excavation starts.
Current practice is to avoid clutter in the excavation by using some kind of tieback anchor-
age (if required). The older methods of Fig. 14-lfc and c produced substantial obstructions
in the work area. Accidental dislodgement of these obstructions (struts and rakers) by equip-
ment could cause a part of the wall to collapse. This mishap could be hazardous to the health
of anyone in the immediate vicinity and to the contractor's pocketbook shortly afterward.

14-1.1 Types of Walls
Until the late 1960s basically two types of walls were used in excavations. These are shown
in Fig. 14-lb and c. Since then there has been a veritable explosion of wall types and/or
materials used for the wall. We might group these walls as follows:

Braced walls using wales and struts
Soldier beam and lagging
Braced sheeting


Bored-pile walls
Diaphragm-slurry walls

Braced walls using struts or rakers as shown in Fig. 14-IZ?, c were widely used up to
the mid-1960s. They are seldom used today except in small projects such as bracing for
water and sewer line trenches that are over about 2.5+ m deep. They are not much used for
large excavations in urban areas since the struts and rakers produce too much clutter in the
excavated area and increase both the labor cost and the possibility of accidents.

port for excavations. Method (a) is most popular in urban

Figure 14-lfc, c

The soldier beam and lagging system of Fig. 14-Ia is popular for temporary construction.
That is, pairs of rolled steel sections (the soldier beams) are driven to a depth slightly below
the final excavation. Their spacing s is on the order of 2 to 4 m so that available timber can
be used for lagging. The lagging timbers, which are slightly shorter than the spacing but on
the order of 50 to 100 mm thick, are installed behind the front flanges (or clipped to the front
flanges using proprietary clips) to retain the soil as excavation proceeds. If the lagging is
behind the flange, some hand excavation is usually required to get the lagging into place.
At depths specified by the foundation engineer—usually computed using empirical
methods—excavation halts and a drill rig is used to drill the anchor holes for tiebacks.
These are installed using bearing plates on the soldier beam flanges and tack welded for the
vertical force component from the anchor; additional welding may be needed to hold the
beams in alignment. The plates may be tilted to accommodate sloping anchorages (see Fig.
E13-5 and Fig. 13-10J). It is usually more economical when using tieback slopes in the range
of 15° to 20° to shop-drill the holes for the anchor rods at approximately that slope (the hole

must be slightly oversize anyway) in the plate to produce an anchor point that costs less than
cutting a channel to produce a slope. Alternatively, the anchor plate may have two holes for
bolting to holes field-drilled into the outer flanges of the soldier beams in lieu of welding for
easier wall disassembly.
Braced sheeting is essentially the anchored sheet-pile wall of Chap. 13 but with multiple
levels of tiebacks or anchors. Construction is similar to the soldier beam lagging system in that
the sheeting is driven and at selected excavation depths the wales and tiebacks are installed.
When using this system it may also be necessary to tilt the anchorage assembly as shown in
Fig. 13- 1Od.
Advantages of both the soldier beam and lagging and the braced sheeting systems are that
they are easy to install (unless the excavation zone is rocky) and to remove and that the mate-
rials can be reused a number of times. The principal disadvantage is that the adjacent property
owner may not allow encroachment (or request a royalty payment deemed too high) to install
the anchorage. Since anchorages are not removed they represent permanent obstacles in the
underground area around the perimeter of the construction site.
When the soil is rocky or the excavation is into rock, one only needs to drive the piling
to the rock interface. Sometimes—especially with sheetpiling—it is impossible to drive the
piling the full depth of the excavation. When this situation occurs, it may be possible to step
the construction as shown in Fig. 14-2. An equation for the sheeting depth for each stage is
given on the figure.

Pile walls are used in these circumstances:

a. It is too difficult to drive soldier beams or sheetpiling.
b. It is necessary to have a nearly watertight wall so as not to lower the GWT outside the
construction perimeter.
c. The retaining wall is to be used as a permanent part of the structural system (e.g., the
basement walls).
d. It is necessary to use the full site space, and adjacent owners disallow using their under-
ground space to install tieback anchors (or there are already existing obstructions such as
tunnels or basement walls).

There are a large number of pile wall configurations or modifications of existing methodol-
ogy, of which Fig. 14-3 illustrates several. The diaphragm-slurry wall is shown in Fig. 14-16
and will be considered in Sec. 14-9. The particular wall configuration used may depend on
available equipment and contractor experience. Terms used in the construction of these walls
are shown on the appropriate figures.
When the wall must be watertight, the secant wall, consisting of interlocking piles (avail-
able in diameters ranging from 410 to 1500 mm), is most suited. This wall is constructed
by first casting a concrete guide wall about 1 m thick and of a width 400 to 600 mm larger
than the pile diameters and preferably with the casing preset for the primary piles. The pri-
mary (or female) piles are then drilled (they may be cased, but the casing must be pulled)
and the piles cast using any required reinforcement. After hardening, the secant (or male)
piles (of the same or smaller diameter) are drilled; during this process the drilling removes
segments of the primary piles so an interlock is obtained as shown (Fig. \4-3b). The secant
piles may also be cased, but here the casing does not have to be removed. They also may
be reinforced—either with reinforcing bar cages or W, H, or I sections placed in the cavity
before the concrete is placed. This pile configuration is possible because of the more recent
development of high-torque drilling equipment capable of cutting hard materials such as rock
and concrete with great efficiency.
Secant pile walls can also be constructed using a cement slurry for the primary piles so
that the cutting for the secant piles is not quite so difficult.
Tiebacks may be used with the pile walls. If the piles are in fairly close lateral contact, the
tiebacks will require wales. For the secant-type piles, the tiebacks are simply drilled through
the pile (although if this is known in advance it might be practical to preset the top one or two
anchor holes in place using large-diameter pieces of plastic tubing cut to size and inserted
into the hole and held in place by some means).
Slurry walls will be considered in Sec. 14-9.

14-1.2 Drilled-in-Place Piles
Where pile-driving vibrations using either pile hammers or vibratory drivers may cause dam-
age to adjacent structures or the noise is objectionable, some type of drilled-in-place piles are
required.
Where the soil to be retained contains some cohesion and water is not a factor, the soldier
beam or drilled-in-place pile spacing may be such that lagging or other wall supplement is not
required, because arching, or bridging action of the soil from the lateral pressure developed
by the pile, will retain the soil across the open space. This zone width may be estimated
roughly as the intersection of 45° lines as shown in Fig. 14-3c, d. The piles will, of course,
have to be adequately braced to provide the necessary lateral soil resistance. This kind of
construction can only be used for a very short time period, because soil chunks will slough
off from gravity and/or local vibrations as drying of the exposed surfaces takes place.
Where sufficient anchorage is available at the pile base (perhaps socketed into rock) and
with an adequate diameter, one method is to design the pile as a prestressed beam (see Fig.
14-3^). After installation the tendon, cast in a conduit, is tensioned to a preset load and anchor-
ed at the top. The prestress load produces a qualitative stress as shown at various sections
along the pile depending on the eccentricity. The pile tends to deflect toward the back-
fill/original ground with the tendon installed as shown, but this deflection is resisted by the
soil so that the final result is a nearly vertical pile and (one hopes) no loss of ground from any
deflection toward the excavation side.


Placing the prestress tendon with e on the right side of the vertical pile axis would tend
to deflect the pile away from the backfill. Although this deflection would more efficiently
utilize the concrete strength /c' in bending, the lateral displacement into the excavation would
encourage additional ground loss.
Where both the earth and water must be retained, the system will have to be reasonably
watertight below the water table and be capable of resisting both soil and hydrostatic pres-
sures. Lowering the water table is seldom practical for environmental reasons but, addition-
ally, it will produce settlement of the soil (and of any structures on that soil). If there is a
high differential water head (the construction area must be kept dry), sheetpiling joints can-
not be relied on to retain water without adequate sealing and/or pumping the infiltration so
the retaining wall solutions may become limited to the secant or slurry wall.
It is evident that uplift or buoyancy will be a factor for those structures whose basements
are below the water table. If uplift is approximately equal to the weight of the structure, or
larger, it will be necessary to anchor the building to the soil. This can be done using anchor
piles to bedrock. Two other alternatives are belled piles (tip enlarged) or vertical "tiebacks."
When making excavations where adjacent property damage can occur from pile driving
or excavation vibrations, one should take enough photographs of the surrounding structures
to establish their initial condition so that future claims can be settled in a reasonable manner.
A select number of ground elevation control stations should be established around the
perimeter of the excavation to detect whether ground loss damage claims are real or imagined.
Ground loss is a very serious problem around excavations in built-up areas. It has not been
solved so far with any reliability; where the ground loss has been negligible, it has been more
a combination of overdesign and luck rather than rational analysis.

14-2 SOIL PRESSURES ON BRACED
EXCAVATION WALLS
The braced or tieback wall is subjected to earth-pressure forces, as are other retaining struc-
tures, but with the bracing and/or tieback limiting lateral wall movement the soil behind the
wall is not very likely to be in the active state. The pressure is more likely to be something
between the active and at-rest state.
With tiebacks (and bracing) the wall is pressed against the retained earth, meaning the lat-
eral pressure profile behind the wall is more trapezoidal than triangular. Figure 14-4 idealizes
the development of wall pressures behind a braced wall.
In stage 1 of Fig. 14-4 the wall is subjected to an active earth pressure, and wall dis-
placement takes place. The lateral deformation depends on cantilever soil-wall interaction
as would be obtained by the finite-element program FADSPABW (B-9) of Chap. 13. Next a
strut force is applied to obtain stage 2. No matter how large the strut force (within practical
limitations), the wall and earth are not pushed back to their original position, but the strut1
force, being larger than the active pressure, causes an increase in the wall pressure.
The integration of the pressure diagram at the end of stage 2 would be approximately
the strut force. It is not exactly that amount of force since inevitably there is soil and an-
chor creep and much uncertainty in earth-pressure distribution. As shown for the end of stage
2 the excavation causes a new lateral displacement between b and c and probably some loss of

'For convenience the term strut force will be used for any kind of restraint—from struts, tiebacks, or whatever.


Figure 14-4 Qualitative staged development of earth pressure behind an excavation. The strut force produces
lateral pressures that generally are larger than the active values. The strut force generally changes with time and
installation method.

strut force (as soil moves out of the zone behind the first strut into the displacement between
b and c) as well as soil creep. The application of the second strut force and/or tightening
up of the first strut results in the qualitative diagram at the beginning of stage 4 and the
excavation and additional ground loss due to lateral movement at the end of stage 4 when
excavation proceeds from c to d. Thus, it is evident that if one measures pressures in back of
this wall they will be directly related to the strut forces and have little relation to the actual
soil pressures involved in moving the wall into the excavation.
Peck (1943) [using measurements taken from open cuts in clay during construction of
the Chicago, IL, subway system (ca. 1939^-1)] and later in the Terzaghi and Peck (1967)
textbook, proposed apparent pressure diagrams for wall and strut design using measured soil
pressures obtained as from the preceding paragraph. The apparent sand pressures of Fig. 14-5
were based primarily on their interpretation of those reported by Krey (in the early 1930s)
from measurements taken in sand cuts for the Berlin (Germany) subway system.
These apparent pressure diagrams were obtained as the envelope of the maximum pres-
sures that were found and plotted for the several projects. The pressure envelope was given
a maximum ordinate based on a portion of the active earth pressure using the Coulomb (or
Rankine) pressure coefficient.
The Peck pressure profiles were based on total pressure using y sat (and not y' = y sat - yw),
and it was never clearly explained how to treat the case of both ys and y sat being retained.
These diagrams have been modified several times, with the latest modifications [Peck
(1969)] as shown in Fig. 14-5. When the Peck pressure diagrams were initially published,
Tschebotarioff and coworkers [see Tschebotarioff (1973)] noted that Peck's initially proposed
clay profiles could produce Ka = 0.0 for certain combinations of S1JyH, so a first modifica-
tion was made to ensure that this did not occur.
Tschebotarioff observed that for most cohesionless soils 0.65A^ ~ 0.25 for all practical
purposes, since </> is usually approximated. On this basis he drew some slightly different
suggested pressure profiles that have received some use.

Figure 14-5 Summary of the Peck (1969) and Tschebotarioff (1973) apparent
lateral pressure diagrams for braced excavations.
The figure and table shown in Fig. 14-5 allow use of either the Peck or Tschebotarioff
apparent (total) pressures or any others by suitable choice of the Zi values.
If one designs a strut force based on the apparent pressure diagram and uses simply sup-
ported beams for the sheeting as proposed by Terzaghi and Peck, the strut force will produce
not more than the contributory area of that part of the apparent pressure diagram. The sheeting
may be somewhat overdesigned, because it is continuous and because simple beam analy-
sis always gives larger bending moments; however, this overdesign was part of the intent of
using these apparent pressure diagrams.
That these apparent pressure diagrams produce an overdesign in normally consolidated
soils was somewhat verified by Lambe et al. (1970) and by Golder et al. (1970), who predicted
loads up to 50 percent smaller than measured strut loads. This difference is not always the
case, however, and if ground conditions are not exactly like those used by Peck in developing
his apparent pressure profiles, the error can sometimes be on the unsafe side.
For example, Swatek et al. (1972) found better agreement using the Tschebotarioff appar-
ent pressures for clayey soils in designing the bracing system for a 21.3-m deep excavation
in Chicago, IL. Swatek, however, used a "stage-construction" concept similar to Fig. 14-4
along with the Tschebotarioff pressure diagram. In general, the Tschebotarioff method may
be more nearly correct in mixed deposits when the excavation depth exceeds about 16 m.

Excavation line


A major shortcoming of all these apparent pressure diagrams is what to do when the re-
tained soil is stratified. In this case it would be reasonable [see also suggestions by Liao and
Neff (1990)] to do the following:

1. Compute two Rankine-type pressure diagrams using the Rankine Ka and Ko{ = 1 - sin (/>)
and using effective unit weights. Make a second pressure diagram for the GWT if appli-
cable.
2. Plot the two pressure diagrams [use 0 for any ( - ) pressure zones] on the same plot.
3. Compute the resultant Ra and R0 for the two pressure plots.
4. Average the two R values, and from this compute an apparent pressure diagram. Take a
rectangle (a = R/H) or a trapezoid. For example if you use z\ = Z3 = 0.25//, the average
pressure a is
_ H + 0.5// _ 2/?av
*av ~ 2 a ^ a ~ JJJj
5. Include the water pressure as a separate profile that is added to the preceding soil pressures
below the GWT depending on the inside water level.
6. Instead of using an average of the two R values from step 3, some persons simply multiply
the active pressure resultant Ra by some factor (1.1, 1.2, 1.3) and use that to produce the
apparent soil pressure diagram. It may be preferable to factor Ra and compare this diagram
to the "average" pressure diagram (using unfactored Ra and R0) and use the larger (or more
conservative) value.

14-2.1 Soil Properties
The soil properties to use for design will depend on whether the wall is temporary or perma-
nent and on the location of the GWT behind the wall.
If the ground is reasonably protected and above the water table, drained soil parameters
would be appropriate (or at least parameters determined from consolidated undrained tests
at the in situ water content). If the retained soil is partly above and partly submerged, the
drained parameters would apply to the region above the water table.
For retained soil below the water table, consolidated-undrained tests would be appropriate.
The lateral pressure from the tieback or bracing would tend to put the soil below the GWT
into a consolidated-undrained condition, but this state would depend on how long the wall
is in place and the permeability of the retained soil. If the wall is in place only a week or
so, undrained strength parameters should be used. Keep in mind that pore water drainage in
cohesionless soils is rapid enough that the drained 4> angle can be used.
The interior zone of the wall is in a plane strain condition whereas the ends or corners are
in more of a triaxial state. When the angle of internal friction cf> is not measured or is taken
(estimated) as less than about 35°, it is not necessary to adjust for plane strain conditions.

14-2.2 Strength Loss with Elapsed Time
Bjerrum and Kirkedam (1958) measured strut forces in an excavation from September
through November that indicated the lateral earth pressure increased from 20 to 63 kPa
owing to an apparent loss of cohesion. This observation was based on back-computing using
consolidated-undrained strength values of both cf) and c and later assuming only a drained


4> angle. Ulrich (1989) observed that tieback and/or strut loads increased with time in over-
consolidated clays. Others have also reported that tieback or strut loads increase with time
but not in a quantitative manner. It appears, however, that 20 to 30 percent increases are not
uncommon. These increases seldom result in failure but substantially reduce the SF.
Cohesion is often reduced in cuts because of changes in moisture content, oxidation, ten-
sion cracks, and possibly other factors, so that on a long-term basis it may not be safe to rely
on large values of cohesion to reduce the lateral pressure. Temporary strut load increases may
also result from construction materials and/or equipment stored on the excavation perimeter.
Where the cut is open only 2 to 5 days, soil cohesion is relied upon extensively to maintain
the excavation sides.

14-3 CONVENTIONAL DESIGN OF BRACED
EXCAVATION WALLS
The conventional method of designing walls (but not pile walls) for excavations consists in
the following steps:

1. Sketch given conditions and indicate all known soil data, stratification, water level, etc.
2. Compute the lateral pressure diagram using Peck's method, Tschebotarioff's method, or
the procedure outlined in the preceding section, depending on the quality (and quantity)
of soil data and what is to be retained. In the case of a cofferdam in water for a bridge pier
or the like, the lateral pressure is only hydrostatic pressure.
3. Design the sheeting, wales, and struts or tiebacks; in the case of a bridge pier cofferdam,
the compression ring.
The sheeting making up the wall can be designed either as a beam continuous over
the several strut/tieback points or (conservatively) as a series of pinned beams as in Fig.
14-6. For continuous sheeting a computer program2 is the most efficient means to obtain
bending moments.

The wales can be designed similarly to those for anchored sheetpile walls. They may be
conservatively taken as pin-ended; however, where a computer program is available, they
can be taken as continuous across the anchor points. Alternatively, we can estimate the fixed-
end moments (fern) conservatively as w>L2/10 (true fern are wL2/12) as was done in Example
13-5. The wale system for a braced cofferdam for a bridge pier and the like, where the plan
area is small, may be designed primarily for compression with the wales across the ends
accurately fitted (or wedged) to those along the sides so that the effect is a compression ring
(even though the plan is rectangular). In this case there may be some struts across the width,
but the end wale loads will be carried into the side wales as an axial compression force.
If tiebacks cannot be used and piles or a slurry wall would be too costly, the only recourse
is to use wales with either struts or rakers as shown in Fig. 14-IZ? and c.
Struts and rakers are actually beam-columns subjected to an axial force such as Rn of Fig.
14-6 and bending from member self-weight. Since the strut is a column, the carrying capacity

if JC = 0.0 m; convert pressure diagram to node forces and input NNZP values. Input E and / for a unit width ( I m
or 1 ft) of sheeting. Make similar adjustments for wales.

method of using a simple beam for strut forces is specifically required if you use the Peck apparent
pressure profiles.
is inversely proportional to the ratio (L/r)2. The only means to reduce the L/r ratio is to use
intermediate bracing. These might be struts used for the end walls; if so, they will greatly
increase the construction area obstructions and will require design of the framing.
Usually vertical supports will be required for horizontal struts unless the unsupported span
is relatively short.
The intended purpose of the struts and rakers (and tiebacks) is to restrain the wall against
lateral movement into the excavation. Any inward movement that takes place must be toler-
ated, for forcing the wall back to the original position is impossible.
Because lateral movement of the wall is associated with a vertical ground settlement in a
perimeter zone outside the excavation (termed ground loss), the following are essential:

1. The wall must fit snugly against the sides of the excavation.This criterion is critical with
soldier beam and lagging or when the wall is placed against the earth face after some depth
of excavation.
2. The struts, rakers, or tiebacks must allow a very limited amount of lateral displacement.
These are all elastic members with an AElL, so some movement toward the excavation
always occurs as the equivalent "spring" stretches or compresses under the wall load.
3. The wales must be sufficiently rigid that displacements interior from the anchor points are
not over 1 to 3 mm more than at the anchors. This criterion assumes the wales are in close
contact with the wall sheeting, so the assumption of a uniform wall pressure computed as
w = FM/S is valid.
4. The bracing must be located vertically so that large amounts of wall bulging into the
excavation do not occur between brace points. This restriction either puts minimum limits
on the stiffness of the wall facing (or sheeting) or limits the vertical spacing of the wales—
or both.

5. The struts or rakers are slightly prestressed by constructing the brace point so that a hy-
draulic jack and/or wedges can be driven between the wale and strut both to force the wales
against the wall and to compress the strut or raker. The system of jacking and/or wedges
usually requires periodic adjustments during construction to maintain the necessary strut
prestress.

The location of the first wale can be estimated by making a cantilever wall analysis using
program FADSPABW (B-9) and several trials for the dredge line location and by inspecting
the output for lateral movement into the excavation. This approach is applicable for all soils;
however, in cohesive soils, the depth should not exceed the depth of the potential tension
crack ht (see Fig. 14-1 a) obtained from using a suitable SF.
The formation of this tension crack will increase the lateral pressure against the lower wall
(it now acts as a surcharge), and if the crack fills with water the lateral pressure increases
considerably. Also, this water will tend to soften the clay in the vicinity for a reduction in
shear strength su.
The choice of the first wale location should also consider the effect of the location of suc-
cessive Rankine active earth wedges as in Fig. 14-lb, since they will develop at approximate
zero moment points from the wall slightly below the excavation line. Note, however, the
wedge angle p is not always p = (45° + c/>/2)—it depends on the cohesion, wall adhesion,
and backfill surcharges. Program SMTWEDGE or WEDGE may be used to approximately
locate the wedge angle p.
Where lateral movement and resulting ground subsidence can be tolerated, the depth to the
first strut in sandy soils may be where the allowable bending stress in the sheeting is reached
from a cantilever wall analysis as in Fig. \4-lc.

Example 14-1. Make a partial design for the braced sheeting system shown in Figs. E14- Ia, b using
PZ footprint 27 sheet-pile sections for the wall. Use either a pair of channels back to back or a pair
of I sections for wales and W sections for struts. The struts will use lateral bracing at midspan for
the weak axis of the struts (giving 2.5 m of unbraced length) as shown by the dotted lines in the
plan view of Fig. E14-la.
Horizontal and vertical construction clearances require the strut spacing shown. The water level
near the bottom of the excavation will be controlled by pumping so that there is no water head
to consider. We will make only a preliminary design at this point (design should be cycled in a
computer program to see if lateral movements are satisfactory for controlling ground loss outside the
perimeter). Use the apparent lateral pressure diagrams of Fig. 14-5 and check using a K0 pressure.

Required. Draw pressure diagram, code the problem, create a data set, and use computer program
FADSPABW (B-9) to analyze strut forces and bending; check bending in sheeting and axial force
in the critical strut.

Solution.
Step 1. Obtain the pressure diagram using Fig. 14-5. For loose sand we have z\ = Z3 = 0 and
Zi = H = 9.3 m. The lateral pressure for the resulting rectangle shown dashed in Fig. E14-1 b is
(Th = 0.65yHKa = 0.65 X 16.5 X 9.3 X 0.333 = 33.2 kPa
This value will be increased 15 percent to allow for water or other uncertainties, giving for design
o-des = 1.15 X 33.2 = 38.2 kPa -» use 38 kPa (Fig. EU-Ib)
What would be the design pressure if we used ko for the pressure coefficient? K0 = 1 - sin 30° =
0.50 and the total wall force is
R0 = \ X 16.5 X 9.32 X 0.5 = 357 kN
Dividing by wall height, we obtain
(T0 = 357/9.3 = 38.38 kPa (very close, so use 38 kPa)

Step 2. Code wall as shown in Fig. E14-Ib and set up data file EX141.DTA (on your diskette) for
using computer program FADSPABW. Use the following input control parameters:
NP = 28 JTSOIL = 10
NM = 13 NONLIN = O (no check)
NNZP = O (no node forces) IAR = 3 (the struts)
NLC = 1 (1 load case) NZX = O (no B.C.)
ITYPE = O for sheet pile wall IPRESS = 11 (11 node pressures input)
LISTB = O (no band matrix list) IMET = 1 (SI units)
NCYC = 1 (embedment depth fixed)
NRC = O (input equation for ks)
Step 3. Estimate the modulus of subgrade reaction ks for the base 2 m of embedment depth using
Eq. (9-10) with the bearing capacity equation as previously used in Chap. 13:
ks = 40(yNqZ + 0.5yBNy)
From Table 4-4 obtain Nq = 18.4 and N7 = 15.1 (Hansen values), which give
ks = 4983 + 12144Z1 (use AS = 5000; BS = 12000; EXPO = 1)
To keep ks from increasing significantly in the 2-m depth we will use an EXPO value of 0.5
instead of 1.0. The value of NRC initially input (and on the data file) informs the program of the
type of equation that will be used. During program execution a "beep," followed by a screen request
to input EXPO, alerts the user to input the value. The EXPO value is output with the equation so
you can check that the correct value was input.
Since the sheeting is continuous, we can use any value for moment of inertia /; however, we will
make a side run (not shown) and try a PZ22, which is the smallest Z section in Table A-3 (Appendix
A). Compute for the PZ22 section the following:
Mn = 64.39/0.560 = 114.98 X 10~6 m4/m
SAn = 0.542/0.560 = 0.9679 X 10"3 m3/m
We must estimate a W section for the strut so that we can compute the spring AE/L (struts are
horizontal). From previous runs (not shown) we will try to use a
W200 X 52 fy = 250 MPa (Fps : W8 X 35 /y = 36 ksi)
A = 6.65 X 10~3 m2 and L = 5.5 m about x axis
Since the strut spans the excavation and is compressed from both ends we will use half the spring
for each wall, and for spacing s = 3 m the input spring K is
AE 6.65X200 000 ^ ^ , ^
K m = T = 3 X 2 X 5 . 5 = 4 0 3 0 0 k N / m
The spring is slightly rounded,3 consistent with the accuracy of the other data.
The y axis has lateral bracing to give an unbraced length L11 of 2.75 m; also
rx = 89 mm ry = 52 mm

3Note that in SI when 10 ~3 and 103 are used and cancel they are not shown—this is one of the major advantages
of using SI.


giving rx/ry = 1.71 < 2 so the x axis controls the column stress. Thus,
Sx = 0.51 X 10~3m3
From these data, using the rectangular pressure diagram of Fig. E14-IZ? we create a data file
EX141.DTA and use it to produce the output sheets shown as Fig. E14-lc.
Step 4. Make an output check and design the members.

a. First check X Fh = 0. Output is 362.9 kN. Using the formula for the area of a trapezoid (and
noting the bottom triangle with a length of 0.5 m), we find the pressure diagram gives

R = ^ X 38 = 362.9 (O.K.)

b. A visual examination of the near-end and far-end moments in the output tables shows
X A/nodes = 0.
c. Check if the strut is adequate. The largest strut force is at S\ = 120.4 kN. The self-weight of
the strut over a 5.5-m span is 52 kg X 9.807 NAg X 0.001 kN/N = 0.51 kN/m. The resulting
maximum bending moment is
wL2 0.51 X 5.52 l o a i X T
Mmax = — - = = 1.93 kN • m
O O
The stress is
M 1.93 O O A / r r i r > '*
T ^ oTf (insignificant)
The allowable axial load for a W200 X 52 section (in column load tables provided by AISC
(1989) or elsewhere) is
^aiiow = 553 kN » 361.2 [3 X 120.4 (may be overdesigned)]
fs = a.low = -y-^-z — 83.2 MPa (bending can be neglected)
A 6.65
Now the question is whether we should use this section or one much smaller. This is answered
by looking at the displacements at the strut nodes. We find these values:

Node Displacement, mm Strut force, kN

2 2.987 120.4
5 2.712 109.3
8 2.703 108.9

Consider the following:

1. These are theoretical displacements, and the actual displacements will probably be larger.
2. When jacking or wedging the struts against the wales, axial loads that are greater than the com-
puted strut loads might be developed.
3. The strut forces are nearly equal; the strut displacements are nearly equal, which is ideal.

Considering these several factors, we find the struts appear satisfactory. Keep in mind this is not
a very large rolled W section.

Step 5. Check the sheet-pile bending stresses. From the output sheet the largest bending moment is
42.75 kN • m and occurs at node 2:

fs = J = ^^g = 44.2MPa (well under 0.6 or 0.65/,)

In summary, it appears this is a solution. It may not be the absolute minimum cost, but it is both
economical and somewhat (but not overly) conservative. Remember: Before the wales and struts
are installed, excavation takes place to a depth that allows adequate workspace for the installation.
That is, already some lateral displacement has not been taken into account here (we will make an
estimate in Example 14-3).
Also, although it is self-evident that we could use two lines of struts (instead of the three shown),
the vertical spacing would be such that the lateral movement in the region between struts could
represent unacceptable perimeter ground loss.

14-4 ESTIMATION OF GROUND LOSS AROUND EXCAVATIONS
The estimation of ground loss around excavations is a considerable exercise in engineering
judgment. Peck (1969) gave a set of nondimensional curves (Fig. 14-8) that can be used to
obtain the order of magnitude. Caspe (1966, but see discussion in November 1966 critical of
the method) presented a method of analysis that requires an estimate of the bulkhead deflec-
tion and Poisson's ratio. Using these values, Caspe back-computed one of the excavations in
Chicago reported by Peck (1943) and obtained reasonable results. A calculation by the au-
thor indicates, however, that one could carry out the following steps and obtain results about
equally good:

1. Obtain the estimated lateral wall deflection profile.

Figure 14-8 Curves for predicting ground loss. [After Peck (1969).]

A = sand and soft clay and average
workmanship
B = very soft to soft clay and limited
in depth below base of excavation
C = very soft to soft clay and great depth

2. Numerically integrate the wall deflections to obtain the volume of soil in the displacement
zone Vs. Use average end areas, the trapezoidal formula, or Simpson's one-third rule.
3. Compute or estimate the lateral distance of the settlement influence. The method proposed
by Caspe for the case of the base soil being clay is as follows:
a. Compute wall height to dredge line as Hw.
b. Compute a distance below the dredge line

where B = width of excavation, m or ft. From steps (a) and (b) we have
Ht = Hw 4- Hp
c. Compute the approximate distance D from the excavation over which ground loss oc-
curs as

D = Jf,tan/45° - I )

4. Compute the surface settlement at the edge of the excavation wall as

Sw ~ D
5. Compute remaining ground loss settlements assuming a parabolic variation of s, from D
toward the wall as

Si = ^ )
Example 14-2. Using the values provided by Caspe, verify the method just given. Figure E14-2
displays data from Caspe and as plotted on Peck's settlement curve. The excavation was 15.85 m
(52 ft) wide and 11.58 m (38 ft) deep. The upper 4.25 m was sand backfill with the remaining
depth being a soft to stiff clay with an undrained <f> = 0°. Displacements were taken on 1.2-m (4-ft)
distances down the wall to the dredge line, and Caspe estimated the remaining values as shown on
the displacement profile.

Solution. Caspe started by computing the total settlement depth based on Hw = 11.58 m +
Hp = B = 15.85 m (<£ = 0°) = 27.43 m = D. Integrating the wall profile from 0.6 m to
-26.83 m {21 A3 — 0.6) using the average end area formula, we obtain

These displacements are shown on the settlement versus excavation distance plot on Fig. E14-2.

Several factors complicate the foregoing calculations. One is the estimation of displace-
ments below the excavation line. However, satisfactory results would probably be obtained
by integrating the soil volume in the lateral displacements to the dredge line. The displace-
ments shown here below the dredge line are an attempt to account somewhat for soil heave
(which also contributes to ground loss) as well as lateral wall movement.

14-5 FINITE-ELEMENT ANALYSIS
FOR BRACED EXCAVATIONS
The finite-element method (FEM) can be used to analyze a braced excavation. Either the
finite element of the elastic continuum (Fig. 14-9) using a program such as FEM2D (noted
in the list of programs in your README.DOC file) or the sheet-pile program FADSPABW
(B-9) can be used.

14-5.1 Finite-Element Method for the Elastic Continuum
The FEM2D program (or similar) uses two-dimensional solid finite elements (dimensions of
a X b X thickness) of the elastic continuum. These programs usually allow either a plane-
stress (ax, dy > 0; az = 0) or plane-strain (ex, ey > 0; ez = 0) analysis based on an input
control parameter. They usually allow several soils with different stress-strain moduli (Es)
and /JL values for Poisson's ratio.
For us to use these programs, it is helpful if they contain element libraries (subroutines)
that can compute stiffness matrix values for solids, beam-column elements (element axial
forces and bending moments), and ordinary column (AE/L) elements. Some programs allow
additional elements, but for two-dimensional analyses of both walls and tunnel liners, these
are usually sufficient and are a reasonable balance between program complexity and practical
use.
In an analysis for an excavation with a wall one would develop a model somewhat as
shown in Fig. 14-9. Initially it would be rectangular, but one should try to take advantage
of symmetry so that only the excavation half shown is analyzed to reduce input and compu-
tational time (and round-off errors). The cross section represents a unit thickness, although
FEM2D allows a thickness to be input such that shear walls, which are often one concrete
block thick, can be analyzed.
It would be necessary to estimate the lateral and vertical dimensions of the model. Lateral
fixity is assumed along the vertical line of symmetry (the CL.). It is convenient to model the
other two cut boundaries with horizontal and vertical columns or struts as shown.


Figure 14-9 A grid of the elastic continuum for using a FEM for estimating excavation movements.

The use of strut-supported boundaries allows a quick statics check, since the sum of the
axial forces in the bottom vertical struts is the weight of the block at any stage. The horizontal
struts on the right side provide a structurally stable soil block. If the right-side nodes are fixed,
they tend to attract stresses unless a very large model is used. By using struts, their EI/L can
be varied so that they provide structural stability without attracting much stress. If there are
large axial loads in the horizontal struts, for any EI/L, the model is too small. If large axial
loads occur, either additional elements must be added to the right or the element x coordinates
of several of the right-side nodes must be increased to produce wider elements and a larger
model.
Wall bracing (or struts) can be modeled by inputting either lateral node forces or springs;
tiebacks can be modeled by inputting AE/L-type elements defined by end coordinates. The
node spacing should be such that any interior tiebacks lie along corner nodes, or so the hor-
izontal component of AE/L is colinear with a node line. This methodology also allows mod-
eling the vertical force component if desired.
Node spacing should be closer (as shown in Fig. 14-9) in critical regions, with larger el-
ement spacing away from the critical zone. Node spacing can be somewhat variable using
more recent FEM that employ isoparametric elements; there is less flexibility with the older
FEM programs, which used triangular nodes (rectangles are subdivided into triangles, ma-
nipulated, and then converted back). The trade-off, since either model computes about the
same results, is to use the method with which you are most familiar.
Model soil excavation in stages as:

1. Vertical—nodal concentration of removed soil weight overlying a node as a | force.
2, Horizontal—nodal concentration of A' X removed soil weight overlying the node as a hor-
izontal node force toward the excavation.

The finite-element analysis for an excavation involves several steps [see also Chang and
Duncan (1970)], as follows:

1. Grid and code a block of the elastic continuum, taking into account excavation depth and
any slopes. It is necessary that the several excavation stages coincide with horizontal grid
lines.
2. Make an analysis of the unexcavated block of step 1 so that you can obtain the node stresses
for the elements in the excavation zone.
3. Along the first excavation line of the finite-element model, obtain the stresses from step
2 and convert them to nodal forces of opposite sign as input for the next analysis, which
will be the excavation of stage 1. Remove all the elements above the excavation outline.
4. Execute the program with the new input of forces and the model with the elements that
were removed in step 3. From this output, obtain the node stresses along the next excava-
tion line. Also, remove all the elements above the current excavation line.
5. Repeat steps 3 through 4 as necessary.

It requires clever node coding to produce an initial data set that can be reused in the several
excavation stages by removing a block of elements for that stage. It may be preferable to use
some kind of element data generator for each stage; some programs have this program built
in and call it a "preprocessor."
There are major problems with using the FEM of the elastic continuum for excavations,
including at least the following:

1. A massive amount of input data is required. Several hundred elements may be required
for each stage plus control parameters and other data.
2. Obtaining soil parameters Es and /x for the several strata that may be in the model is very
difficult.
3. Most critical is the change in the elastic parameters Es and Poisson's ratio fx when the
soil expands laterally toward the excavation or against the excavation wall and vertically
upward (heaves) from loss of overburden pressure. If these values are not reasonably cor-
rect, one does a massive amount of computation to obtain an estimate that may be as much
as 100 percent in error.

Clough and coworkers at Virginia Polytechnic Institute claim modest success using this
procedure and have published several papers in support of these claims—the latest is Clough
and O'Rourke (1990), but there were several earlier ones [Clough and Tsui (1974); Clough
et al. (1972)]. Others have used this method in wall analysis, including Lambe (1970), but
with questionable success.
14-5.2 The Sheet-Pile Program to Estimate
Lateral Wall Movements
The sheet-pile program FADSPABW can be used to make a wall movement estimate as fol-
lows:

1. Locate the nodes at convenient spacings. You will want to locate nodes at all tiebacks or
struts. Also locate nodes about 0.5 m below where any tiebacks or struts are to be installed
so there is room for their installation.


L Code the full wall depth including to the dredge line and the depth of embedment for stage
1. You do this so that most of the element and other data can be reused in later stages by
editing copies of the initial data file. Use NCYC = 1 and probably NONLIN = O to avoid
excessive refinement.
\. Referring to Fig. 14-4, make a number of trials using the conventional lateral pressure
profile and including any surcharge. Do not use a pressure diagram such as in Fig. 14-5 at
this point. These several trials are done to find a reasonable depth of excavation so that the
first strut can be installed without excessive lateral deflection of the wall top. Depending
on the situation, this displacement probably should be kept to about 25-30 mm.
I. Copy the foregoing data set and edit it to install the first strut and excavate to the next
depth. You can now continue using the conventional lateral pressure profile or some kind of
diagram of Fig. 14-5. The following program parameters are changed: JTSOIL; IAR = 1
(first strut); and IPRESS [to add some PRESS(I) values]; and reduce XMAX(I) entries.
;. Now copy this data set at a second strut; change JTSOIL; IAR = 2; IPRESS [and
PRESS(I)]; and again reduce the number of XMAX(I) entries.
>. Make a copy of this data set, add the next strut, and so forth.
The displacement profile is the sum of the displacements with the sign from the preceding
equence of steps.
Example 14-3. Make an initial estimate of the lateral movements of the braced excavation for
which the sheeting and struts were designed in Example 14-2. The data sets for this problem are
on your program diskette as EX143A, EX143B, EX143C, and EX143D.DTA, so you can rapidly
reproduce the output.

Solution.
Stage 1. Draw the full wall height of 11.3 m as shown in Fig. E14-3<z and locate nodes at strut points
and other critical locations. For struts Sl, S2, additional nodes of 0.5 m are added below the strut to
give enough room for its installation. The 1.8 m depth below strut S3 is only divided into two 0.9-m
elements. From this information the initial input is
NP = 34 (17 nodes—we are using more than in Example 14-2)
NM = 16
IAR = O
JTSOIL = 4
The soil pressure diagram used is shown in Fig. E14-3Z?, and the last (4th node value) nonzero
entry = 16.5 kPa = \6.5zK0 = 16.5(2.0)(0.5). Note use of K0 and not Ka to give a somewhat
more realistic model.
Refer to data set EX143A.DTA for the rest of the input and use it to make an execution for a set
of output.
Stage 2. Make a copy of EX143A.DTA as EX143B.DTA (on your diskette) with the strut installed
IAR = 1, JTSOIL, IPRESS, PRESS(I), and XMAX(I) reduced. Refer to the pressure profile for
the additional PRESS(I) entries.
Make an execution of this data set to obtain a second set of output. You have at this point exca-
vation to node 8 with strut Sl installed at node 3.
Stage 3. Make a copy of EX143B.DTA as EX143C.DTA (on your diskette). Now install strut S2
using IAR = 2. Use JTSOIL = 12 and adjust IPRESS, PRESS(I), and XMAX(I).
Make an execution of this data set to obtain a third set of output.

Stage 4. Make a copy of EX143C.DTA as EX143D.DTA (on your diskette). Now install strut S3
using IAR = 3. Use JTSOIL = 13 (will excavate to bottom of excavation) and adjust IPRESS,
PRESS(I), and XMAX(I).
Make an execution of this data set to obtain a fourth set of output, etc. (takes 8 data sets).
A partial output summary follows:

Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 4
Excavate to
Node 2.0 m 5.0 m 8.4 m 9.3 m X &h

1 7.0 mm -3.1 -0.5 -0.6 2.8 mm
51 3 3.7 1.4 0.4 0.8 6.3
5 1.7 4.2 1.2 1.8 8.9
52 7 — 5.3 4.8 3.0 13.1
9 — 3.3 9.5 4.0 16.8
53 11 — 0.2 13.5 4.3 18.0
B.E. 13 — -0.2 6.1 3.9 9.8


The total node displacements X &h look reasonable for this type of excavation. It is not unreason-
able that there could be 18.0 mm of displacement at strut S3. If the value is deemed high, one can
do some adjusting, but basically this procedure gives you an estimate of what the lateral movements
might be. They could be less than this but are not likely to be more unless there is extremely poor
workmanship.
The strut forces and wales were designed in Example 14-2. This example is only to give an
estimate of lateral displacements. If you work with copies of the data sets you might be able to
improve the displacements, but keep in mind that no matter how you manipulate the numbers the
actual measured values are what count.

Example 14-3 gives a fairly simple means to make an estimate of lateral wall movement
into an excavation. Notice that the first set of data (EX143A.DTA) is the most difficult. Be-
yond that only a few values are changed. Actually, to avoid confusing the user the data sets
have generally been edited more than actually required for all but the last one. Note also that
a backfill surcharge or some earth pressure factor other than K0 can be used to produce a
number of different earth pressure and displacement profiles.
In any case this procedure is about as accurate (in advance of construction) as any other
procedure and far simpler than the FEM of the elastic continuum.

14-6 INSTABILITY DUE TO HEAVE OF BOTTOM
OF EXCAVATION
When a braced excavation (sometimes called a cofferdam) is located either over or in a soft
clay stratum as in Fig. 14-1Oa, the clay may flow beneath the wall and into the excavation,
producing heave if sufficient soil is removed that the resisting overburden pressure is too
small.
The pressure loss from excavation results in a base instability, with the soil flow producing
a rise in the base elevation commonly termed heave, which can range from a few millimeters
to perhaps 300 mm. This case can be analyzed from Mohr's circle using Eqs. (2-54) and
(2-55) as done in Fig. 14-2 or as the bearing failure of Fig. 4-1.
There are two general cases to consider:
Case 1. In this instance the goal is to provide sufficient depth of the piling of Fig. 14-
10 to prevent the soft underlying clay from squeezing into the excavation. For this case and

referring to Fig. 14-10 for identification of terms we have (noting Ka = J~K~a = 1) for ele-
ment A
0-3 = yD - 2su (a)
and for element B we have
a[ = yh + 2su (b)
since a\ = (73 and a'3 - yh = crj - 2sM. Substituting values, we find that
yh = yD- 2su - 2su
Solving for the critical depth D = Dc and inserting an SF we obtain the desired equation:

Case 2. This is a general analysis for excavation depth where the depth of excavation is
limited such that the effective bearing capacity of the base soil can be utilized.
This more general analysis is as follows (refer to Fig. 14-11). Block OCBA produces a net
vertical pressure av on OA of

of the wall) we obtain

where qu\t = c'N'c + yhNq.

Substituting and simplifying, we obtain the maximum depth of wall D' (including any

y r - ^yDKatancj)- ca
For the case of <£> = 0 above the base of the wall, Eq. (14-2) reduces to
D, = CK + 7HN -qs +
J-cJr
In these equations use an SF on the order of 1.2 to 1.5 (i.e., d^es = D'/SF); use the upper
range of around 1.4 to 1.5 for anisotropic soils [see Mana and Clough (1981)]. Carefully note
that the inside depth h above the wall base is a factor, and if the upper soil has a <f> angle, the
critical depth is found by trial using Eq. (14-2). Equation (14-2«) contains a bearing capacity
factor N'c. This value is obtained from Table 14-1, and one uses either N'c or N'c rect depending
on whether the excavation is square or has B/L < 1. The values in Table 14-1 were given
as curves by Skempton (1951), who plotted them from work by Meyerhof in the late 1940s.
Bjerrum and Eide (1956) are usually incorrectly credited with the curves. The author has
elected to provide tabulated values so that users can either compute values or draw curves to
a useful scale.
Bjerrum and Eide (1956) used the N'c bearing-capacity factors from Table 14-1 to analyze
the base stability of 14 deep excavations and found a very reasonable correlation of ±16
percent. Later Schwab and Broms (1976) reanalyzed the Bjerrum and Eide excavations plus
two others and concluded that the correlation might have been improved if anisotropy had
been considered.

Example 14-4. Refer to Fig. E14-4. Can an excavation be made to 18 m, and if so what depth of
sheeting is required to avoid a bottom heave (or soil flow into the excavation) based on using an SF
of at least 1.25? Note that this problem formulation is the usual situation, and Eqs. (14-1) and (14-2)
are of little value, but the derivation procedure is valuable since we have to use some of the parts.

Solution, Let us use these estimates:

7sand = 17.00 kN/m3
yclay = 18.00 kN/m3
Consider the 3 m of sand as a surcharge, giving
qs = 3X 17.00 = 51 kPa
Take an unweighted4 average of the undrained shear strength of the clay for design, so that
„ 4 0 + 60

4An unweighted average is acceptable if no strength value in the region from B above to 2B below the base depth
is smaller than 50 percent of the average strength. If any strength values are smaller than 50 percent of the average,
then you should weight the strength as sM>av = X suj X Hj^L Hi.


Figure £14-4

Assume that there will be wall adhesion of 0.8c. We will try an initial depth of D = 18+1 = 19 m.
This gives the depth of interest as
D' = 19 - 3 m (of sand) = 16 m
The dimension r = OJOlB = 0.707 X 12 = 8.5 m. For this state we have
av = -D'c Jr + yD' + qs
and substitution gives
<TV = -16(0.8 X 50/8.5) + 16(18.0) + 51
= -75.3 + 288.0 + 51 = 263.7 kPa
The bearing-pressure resistance quit = cN'crQCt + yh Qi = 1 m). Thus,
N'c = (5.14 X 1.2)(1 + 0.4 • tan"1 1.5)(0.84 + 0.16 x 0.50) (see Table 14-1)
= 6.17 x 1.39X0.92 = 7.89
This result gives qun = 50(7.89) + 18(1) = 412.5. The resulting safety factor is
S F = W i -lM
 <OJL>
Note: The wall sheeting would have to be at least 18 m, but 19 m gives some base restraint as
well as a slight increase in the SF.

14-7 OTHER CAUSES OF COFFERDAM INSTABILITY
A bottom failure in cohesionless soils may occur because of a piping, or quick, condition if
the hydraulic gradient h/L is too large. A flow net analysis may be used as illustrated in Fig.
2-12 (it does not have to be highly accurate) to estimate when a quick condition may occur.
Possible remedies are to drive the piling deeper to increase the length of the flow path L of
Fig. 14-12a or to reduce the hydraulic head h by less pumping from inside the cell. In a few
cases it may be possible to use a surcharge inside the cell.

In Fig. 14-122?, the bottom of the excavation may blow in if the pressure head hw indicated
by the piezometer is too great, as follows (SF = 1.0):
JwK = yshs
This equation is slightly conservative, since the shear, or wall adhesion, on the walls of the
cofferdam is neglected. On the other hand, if there are soil defects in the impervious layer,
the blow-in may be local; therefore, in the absence of better data, the equality as given should
be used. The safety factor is defined as

SF = - ^ J L > i.25

14-8 CONSTRUCTION DEWATERING
Figure 14-12 indicates that water inflow into an excavation can cause a bottom failure. Where
it is impractical or impossible to lower the water table, because of possible damage claims
or environmental concerns, it is necessary to create a nearly impervious water barrier around
the excavation. Because no barrier is 100 percent impervious, it is also necessary to provide
drainage wells below the bottom of the excavation, called sump pits, that are pumped as
necessary to maintain a reasonably dry work space.
The groundwater level outside the excavation will require monitoring wells to avoid real
(or imagined) claims for damages from any lowering of the original groundwater level.
Where it is allowed to depress the water table in the vicinity of the excavation, a system
of perimeter wells is installed. This system may consist of a single row of closely spaced
wellpoints around the site. A wellpoint is simply a section of small-diameter pipe with per-
forations (or screen) on one end that is inserted in the ground. If the soil is pervious in the
area of the pipe screen, the application of a vacuum from a water pump to the top of the pipe
will pull water in the vicinity of the pipe into the system. A vacuum system will be limited
in the height of water raised to about 6 m. Theoretically water can be raised higher, but this
type of system is less than theoretical. More than one set of perimeter wells can be installed
as illustrated in Fig. 14-13. This type of system is seldom "designed"; it is contracted by

companies that specialize in this work. Although rough computations can be made, the field
performance determines the number of wellpoints and amount of pumping required.
Where wellpoints are not satisfactory or practical, one may resort to a system of perimeter
wells that either fully or partially penetrate the water-bearing stratum (aquifer) depending on
site conditions and amount of pumpdown. Again, only estimates of the quantity of water can
be made, as follows.
One may use a plan flow net as in Fig. 14-14 to obtain the seepage quantity. A plan flow
net is similar to a section flow net as in Chap. 2. The equipotential drops are now contour lines
of equal elevation intersecting the flow paths at the same angle. Sufficient contour lines must
be established to represent the required amount of drawdown to provide a dry work area.
Some approximation is required, since it is not likely that the piezometric head is constant
for a large distance around an excavation. Furthermore, approximation is necessary because
a system of wells located around the excavation will not draw down the water to a constant
contour elevation within the excavation. The water elevation will be a minimum at—and
higher away from—any well. From a plan flow net the quantity of water can be estimated as

Q = ak(№)^fL (14-3)

where Nf = number of flow paths (integer or decimal)
Ne = number of equipotential drops (always integer)


Figure 14-14 Plan flow net. Note it is only neces-
sary to draw enough flow and equipotential lines to
obtain Nf, Ne.
AH = H2 - h2 for gravity flow (see Fig. 14-15)

L = 1.0 for gravity flow

k = coefficient of permeability in units consistent with H and L
a = 0.5 for gravity flow
= 1.0 for artesian flow

An estimate of the number of wells and flow per well is obtained by placing one well in
the center of each flow path. The resulting flow per well is then
Number of wells = Nf
Flow per well = QjNf
An estimate of the quantity of water that must be pumped to dewater an excavation can
also be obtained by treating the excavation as a large well (Fig. 14-15) and using the equation
for a gravity flow well,

where terms not previously defined are
H = surface elevation of water at the maximum drawdown influence a distance R from
well center
hw = surface elevation of water in well
rw = well radius (use consistent units of m or ft)
This equation is for gravity wells; that is, the piezometric head and static water level are
coincident, which is the likely case for pumping down the water table for a large excavation.

The maximum radius of drawdown influence R is not likely to be known; however, one may
estimate several values of R/rw and obtain the corresponding probable pumping quantities Q.
The value of the static groundwater level H is likely to be known, and hw would normally be
estimated at 1 to 2 m below the bottom of the excavation.
This estimate of well pumping to dewater an excavation should be satisfactory for most
applications. It is not likely to be correct, primarily because the coefficient of permeability
k will be very difficult to evaluate unless field pumping tests are performed. It is usually
sufficient to obtain the order of magnitude of the amount of water to be pumped. This is used
for estimating purposes, and the contract is written to pay for the actual quantity pumped.
Example 14-5. Estimate the flow quantity to dewater the excavation shown in Fig. 14-14. Other
data are as follows:
H = 50 m a = 60 m
AH = 15 m b = 100 m
k = 0.2 m/day D= 100 m
The soil profile is as shown in Fig. E14-5.
Solution. We will use a plan flow net (Fig. 14-14 was originally drawn to scale) and compute the
quantity using Eq. (14-3) and check the results using Eq. (14-4).
Step 1. Compute Q for the plan flow net (assume gravity flow after drawdown is stabilized). From
Fig. 14-14, Nf = 10; Ne = 2.1; and from Fig. E14-5 we obtain


Silty clay

Figure E14-5

Substitution of these values into Eq. (14-3) with a = 0.5 yields
Q = ak(kH)^fL = 0.5 X 0.2 X (2500 - 1156)^(1) = 640 m3/day
N e 2.1
and since Nf = 10 the number of wells = 10.
Step 2. Check results using Eq. (14-4):

Q = —TTTw—r^ (may be O.K. when drawdown is stabilized)
ln(R/rw)
R= 100 m (unless we draw down the river) + rw
[A /60 X 100 . . . . .
rw = J— = J = 43.7 —> use 44 m
Substitution gives
n 77X0.2(2500-1156) 2

This flow quantity compares quite well with the flow net construction, and the actual flow quantity
may be on the order of 675 to 750 m3/day.

14-9 SLURRY-WALL (OR -TRENCH) CONSTRUCTION
The placement of a viscous fluid, termed a slurry, in a narrow trench-type excavation to keep
the ground from caving is a method in use since the early 1960s. The basic method had been
(and is) used for oil well and soil exploration drilling to maintain boreholes in caving soils
without casing. The large hydrostatic pressure resulting from several hundred meters of slurry
allowed retention of oil or gas in oil wells until they could be capped with valving to control
the fluid flow rate. The slurry used for these procedures is generally a mix of bentonite (a
montmorillonitic clay-mineral-based product), water, and suitable additives.
Walls constructed in excavations where a slurry is used to maintain the excavation are
termed slurry, diaphragm-slurry, or simply diaphragm walls. Figure 14-16 illustrates a

method of constructing a diaphragm wall. Here piles are driven on some spacing, and alter-
nate sections are excavated, with slurry added to keep the cavity full as excavation proceeds
to the desired depth. It is necessary to maintain the cavity full of slurry—and sufficiently
agitated to maintain a uniform density—to keep the sides of the excavation from caving.
Reinforcing bar cages are then put in place, and concrete is placed by a tremie (a pipe from
the surface to carry the concrete to the bottom of the excavation) to fill the trench from the
bottom up.
The slurry displaced by the concrete is saved in a slurry pit for use in the next section of
wall, etc. The pipe piles shown (not absolutely necessary for all walls) can be pulled after the
first wall sections are formed and partially cured, or they can be left in place. The purpose of
the piles is to provide a watertight seal and continuity between sections. Although the piles
shown are the full wall width, they can be some fraction of the width and serve equally well.
In cases where the wall depth is too great for piles to self-support the lateral pressure from
outside the excavation, the walls can be braced or tiebacks used. Tiebacks require drilling
through the concrete, but this is not a major task with modern equipment so long as the
reinforcement cages are designed so that the drill does not intersect rebars. These types of
walls are usually left in place as part of the permanent construction.
This method and similar wall construction methods are under continuous development—
primarily outside the United States. Figure 14-17 illustrates one of the more recent proprietary
procedures for producing a slurry-type wall, which consists of three drills aligned with mix-
ing paddles as shown. Here a soil-cement slurry (with various additives depending on wall
purpose) is used, producing what is called a soil-cement mixed wall (SMW). Wide-flange
beams can be inserted into the freshly constructed SMW section for reinforcing if necessary.
Wall sections can range in width from about 1.8 to 6 m and up to 61 m in depth. Taki and
Yang (1991) give some additional details of installation and use. A major advantage of this
type of construction is that there is very little slurry to dispose of at the end of the project.
Open trenches that are later backfilled or filled with clay, clay-soil, or lean concrete to
act as cutoff walls (as for dams) and to confine hazardous wastes are termed slurry trenches.
These are widely used with bentonite as the principal slurry additive.

Concrete walls constructed using the slurry method can use wale and strut or tiebacks for
additional support against lateral movement. Walls have been built with lateral displacements
as low as 6 mm (^ in.); however, excessive lateral wall displacements can occur if the site
and soil conditions are not correctly assessed.
Slurry walls are about two times as expensive (per m2 or ft2) as walls of sheetpiling or
soldier beams and lagging. For this reason, they are used when it is essential that ground loss
be kept to near zero and when the walls can be used as part of the permanent construction.
They are generally more impermeable than sheetpiling when used as water barriers; however,
geotextiles can be competitive for this type of construction.
Basically, slurry construction consists in making an evaluation of the required density
and properties of the slurry based on the site soil profile; providing a means to develop large
quantities of the water admixture; and, as the excavation proceeds, keeping the ground cavity
filled to the necessary depth with the slurry. When excavation is complete, the slurry-filled
cavity is periodically agitated to keep the admixture in suspension. Obviously the agitation
must be carefully done to avoid wall caving. Next the cavity is filled using a tremie so that the
wall is cast from the bottom up. This action ensures a solid wall and, in the case of concrete, a
minimum exposure (for both strength and bonding quality) to slurry. The slurry is displaced
from the top and saved for use in the next trench section if stage construction is employed.
Disposal of slurry (a slime) is the greatest disadvantage of this type construction.
Slurry construction depends upon two factors for successful performance:

1. Formation of a filter skin or "cake" about 3 mm thick at the interface of the slurry and
excavation via gel action and particulate precipitation—the primary purpose of select ad-
ditives.
2. Stabilization of lateral pressure owing to the dense slurry pushing against the filter skin
and sidewalls of the excavation. Slurry density is adjusted by using select additives as
well.

Since field performance indicates that walls are usually (but not always) stable with a
slurry pressure 65 to 80 percent of the active soil pressure, the filter cake must provide con-
siderable stability [Gill (1980)].
The slurry must be of sufficient viscosity that it does not easily drain out through the sides
of the excavation and the filter skin coat. If the filter skin forms reasonably well, exfiltration
loss will likely be minimal and the filter skin penetration into the sides of the excavation may
be on the order of only a few millimeters where fine-grained soils are supported. A slurry
excavation in gravel was reported by La Russo (1963) to have penetrated some 16 m into the
surrounding soil, but this may be considered exceptional.
Slurry construction can be used for both caving and cohesive soils and has been used
for drilled piers as well as wall and trench construction [O'Neill and Reese (1972), Lorenz
(1963)]. Slurry densities up to p = 1.92 g/cm3 can be obtained using a mixture of barium
sulfate (barite of specific gravity G = 4.3 to 4.5) and bentonite (for gel action with G = 2.13
to 2.18). Other materials, including silt, clay, and fine sand from the excavation, may be
included in the slurry mix to reduce the quantity of commercial admixture.
Where the soil is loose, subject to caving, or gravelly, it may first be grouted to obtain
some stability before constructing the slurry wall. In some cases, the grout alone may be suffi-
cient to allow the excavation to stand long enough to place wall sections. This may be possible


owing to the strength gain from the grout and arching action of the soil. It should be evident
that when this is done the wall segments must be fairly short.
Cement and finely ground slag have been used in slurry as admixtures to increase p. At
present there are polymers based on carboxymethyl cellulose, xanthan gum, and several poly-
acrylates that can be used for special site conditions. Generally their costs are six to eight
times that of the more common bentonite-based slurries, but if they can be reused sufficiently,
their cost becomes competitive.
Commonly, slurry densities of p = 1.15 to 1.25 g/cm3 are employed using a mixture of
bentonite, barite, and a dispersing agent to reduce the tendency of the clay to floe. The gel is
a natural by-product of the admixture, and the basic design element consists in determining
the required density of the slurry.
The slurry mixture is a trial process in the laboratory, where water, clay, and any other
admixture(s) are mixed by trial until a slurry with the desired density p (and gel properties)
is obtained. In use it will be necessary to check the slurry density on a regular basis and either
agitate or revise the basic formula as required.
Referring to Fig. 14-ISa, for a clay excavation without a slurry, the critical depth is as
computed in Chap. 11-1

H - *

With slurry in the trench and the GWT at the ground surface (not the general case shown),
a horizontal force summation for the usual case of undrained conditions (terms are identified
on Fig. 14-18a) gives
~~* Pslur *"" * soil <r~ Pwater
hsiur#2 - [\{JS ~ yw)H2 - 2suH] - \ywH2 = 0
Solving for depth H, we obtain the following equation, which is usually used in clay:
H= AS»
Js - Tslur
And with an SF we have the resulting design equation of

" " SF(^W <14"5>
Either the safety factor or the excavation depth H can be made larger by increasing ysiur.
This equation was first presented by Nash and Jones (1963) and later verified by Meyerhof
(1972).
In cohesionless soils (Fig. 14-18Z?) the slurry density is obtained (with the GWT at the
ground surface) as
bsiurtf2 " WsH2Kt - \JwH2 = 0
from which we have the slurry unit weight (usually in g/cm3) as
7siur ^ y'sKi + y^g/cm3) (14-6)
In this equation take Ka < Ki < K0.

The filter skin or cake that forms at the soil-slurry interface contributes stability to the
trench; however, a reliable means of predicting its effect is not available. The beneficial effect
can implicitly be allowed for by using a small factor of safety. To ensure skin formation, the
slurry head should be 1 m above the water table in cohesive soils and about 1.5 m in granular
soils [Gill (1980)]. Carefully note that although you can directly use Eqs. (14-5) and (14-6) for
design, for the general case you must be sure the slurry is above the GWT as just noted. You
may also, however, compute more accurate replacements for Eqs. (14-5) and (14-6) using a
horizontal force summation that considers the actual groundwater location together with the
wet ys and saturated y's soil unit weights. This is a substantial amount of work for a doubtful
increase in project confidence.
Another alternative to the use of Eqs. (14-5) and (14-6) is to use the trial wedge method
to obtain a "wall force" Pw, which is resisted by Psiur (of Fig. 14-18). Now equate the wall
force to Psiur and obtain the required slurry density as
bslur#2 > Pw
Depending on site geometry, you may be able to use the computer programs SMTWEDGE
or WEDGE to obtain Pw.
Example 14-6. Show the effect of slurry density on excavation depth H in a cohesive soil and using
an SF = 1.5. Other data for this problem are
su = 35kPa ys = 18.2 kN/m3
Solution. Use Eq. (14-5) with several ysiur values to make a short table. Setting up Eq. (14-5) for
these problem parameters, obtain
= ^su = 4 X 3 5
SF(y5 - yslur) 1.5(18.2 - yslur)
Using this equation now create the following table:
Psiur, g/cm3 yslur, kN/m3 H, m

15-1 CELLULAR COFFERDAMS: TYPES AND USES
Cellular cofferdams are constructed of steel sheetpiling and used primarily as water-retaining
structures. They depend for stability on the interaction of the soil used to fill the cell and the
steel sheetpiling. Either material used alone is unsatisfactory; both materials in combination
provide a satisfactory means to develop a dry work area in water-covered sites such as ocean-
or lakefront or river area construction projects.
We will define the land, inside, or dry side of the cofferdam as the basin side and the
outside as the water side since the cofferdam is usually used to keep water out of the basin.
Cellular cofferdams are not intended to be completely impervious but rather provide suffi-
cient resistance to water flow that the quantity of water that does seep through can be readily
pumped.
Cellular cofferdams are of three basic types: circular, diaphragm, and cloverleaf (see Fig.
15-1). These structures are usually constructed of straight-web sheetpiling since a cell full of
soil and/or water tends to split so that tension stresses are produced in the web. A straight web
will have essentially in-plane tension stresses; the out-of-plane thin webs of Z piles would
develop large moments and very high bending stresses from cell-bursting forces. Tension
forces would also produce large pile distortion as the pile attempted to straighten and for
these two reasons Z piles are not used for the type of construction considered in this chapter.
Cofferdams are most commonly constructed using circular cells with smaller connecting
partial cells as shown in both Figs. 15-1 and 15-4. Sometimes for waterfront structures the
back side of the connecting circular cell or diaphragm (see Fig. 15-2) is omitted, however, if
this is done one should consider using an anchored bulkhead.
For working out into a river or for certain types of near-shore marine work a combination
of circular cells is used to create a basin as in Fig. 15-3. Figure 15-1 (see also Fig. 15-4)
illustrates the usual method of joining several circular cells for this purpose. There have been
a few cases where the modified full circular and diaphragm cell types of Fig. 15-2 have been
successfully used.

CELLULAR COFFERDAMS


Figure 15-1 Types of conventional cellular cofferdams. Typical dimensions are shown for analysis. Alternative
cell configurations are shown in Fig. 15-2.

River dams commonly use a form of Fig. 15-3 where approximately half the river is
blocked with the cell line 1-2 and the work area enclosed by cells along lines 1-2-3-4 as
shown in Fig. 15-3. A part of the dam is then built in this area and when completed, cells
3A-4 and 2A-1 are removed, leaving cell line 2-3 with the sheetpiling reused to construct a
cofferdam from cell 2 to the far shore and from cell 3 to the far shore. When that section of dam
is complete the cofferdam is removed and most of the piling is salvaged. The dam connection
where the cell line 2-3 is located is done as most convenient to the contractor. For example an
alternative line of cells might be set from 2B to 3B before removing piling from 2B to 1 and
3B to 4 and the far shore cofferdam then extended from 2B to shore and from 3B to shore, etc.

Figure 15-2 Cofferdam cell modifications. Not shown is modification of height of basin-side pilings (sometimes 1 to 2 m
shorter than river-side piles).

Occasionally single cells may be used as offshore mooring structures for barges and other
marine equipment. In this case extension walls to provide shore access may consist of one
or more arcs of sheeting, however, again it may be more economical to use a double line of
anchored walls using a common anchor rod between opposite wales as shown in Fig. 13-ld.
Cellular cofferdams may also be used for structures such as breakwaters and retaining
walls, or the cells may be built out into the water and capped with concrete or asphalt pave-
ment to function as piers for boats to load or unload cargo.

15-1.1 Cell Construction
Cofferdam cells are constructed by assembling the necessary number of sheet piles around a
wooden template consisting of two rings (or other shape) spaced vertically about 3 m apart
that have been anchored into correct position (usually with four or more steel HP piles). The
sheetpiling is then placed into position with the pile sections, which have been fabricated1 to
connect the cells (wyes or tees), set into position first and as accurately as possible.
These become key piles; in deep water it may be necessary to add additional key piles
made using regular sheets to which light beams or angles (or thicker plates as shown in Fig.
15-4) have been bolted to the interior part to increase their stiffness. One can also use one of
the HP pile sections of Fig. 13-6b. The remainder of the piles are then set both ways from the
key piles to close the cell. At this point the pile tips are resting in the overburden at the bottom
of the river. If the closure piles do not slip easily in the interlocks to the bottom, the adjacent
piling is picked up in multiples and "shaken out" until all the sheets in the cell perimeter are

use shop fabrication.

free-running in the interlocks. Driving can now commence and the cell piles are driven—
usually in pairs to a depth of about 1 to 2 m, then the next pair, etc., around the cell perimeter.
This process requires an even multiple of piles between the key piles. The operation is then
repeated, either using a new starting pair of piles or going in reverse, to avoid distortion of
the cell from systematic accumulation of driving effects to one side.
Two or more piles are set for the start of the connecting arcs before the key piles are driven
to final grade. Long piles may require splicing, for the driving equipment will have some kind
of length limitation. Splices are made by cutting the first piles in staggers so that the splice
will vary up and down some 1 to 2 m and fall above basin side cell water line and side ground
level on either side.
In fast-moving water or high winds, pile-setting operations are greatly slowed as it is dif-
ficult to maintain pile alignment. A movable fender or breakwater may be used in fast water
to protect the piles during driving but for wind there is little that can be done.
The cell template should be positioned within about 150 to 300 mm of alignment for circu-
lar cells and to less than 150 mm for diaphragm cells. Closer tolerance than this is not often
possible and is usually unnecessary owing to cell distortion during filling and dewatering
operations.

15-1.2 Cells and Number of Piles Required for a Cell
A series of connecting soil-filled cells (Fig. 15-2) around the perimeter of a work area is
termed a cofferdam. The basin side is usually provided with a drainage ditch emptying into
sump pits where the water can be pumped back to the wet side.
The circular cell cofferdam of Fig. 15-la consists of circles of different radii intersecting
as shown. The cell intersection angle a is usually either 30° or 45° (Fig. 15-la). The joint
is either a 90° T or a 30° Y, but other angles might be used for special cases. The 30° Y is
claimed to produce smaller stresses in the connection than other angles for connecting deep,
large-diameter cells.
Sheetpiling interlocks allow a maximum of about 10° deflection between pieces. This
results in a minimum cell radius of
_ Driving distance, m or ft
T 2 sin 10°
For a PS31 section, r « 0.50/(2 X sin 10°) = 1.44 m for a minimum cell diameter « 2.88 m.
The number of sheet piles Ns in a cell (or circle) of radius r and driving distance Dj (given
in sheet-pile tables such as Appendix Tables A-3a, A-3b) is

Ns = 7^- (15-1)

For a cell diameter of 6.05 m and using PS27.5 sections, we find that the driving distance
(Appendix A-3#) Dd = 0.500 m requires


Round off and use 38 piles. If the decimal fraction were much over 0.01 it would be necessary
to round up to 40 piles (must use integer multiples of 2 for driving in pairs). Forty piles would
require that the diameter be slightly increased to

Diam = '- = 6.37 m (vs. original 6.05 m)
77
Pile producers generally will provide free tables for calculating the number of piles needed
for cells and diaphragms of varying practical dimensions.

15-1.3 Diaphragm Cells
Diaphragm cells are made of a series of circular arcs connected by crosswalls (diaphragms)
using 120° intersection pieces (Figs. 15-1/?, 15-4d). The radius of the arc is often made equal
to the cell width L' (Fig. 15-16) so that the interlock tension in the arcs and diaphragms may
be equal. The distance A shown in Fig. 15-lb may be either positive for high, wide cells or
negative for low, narrow cells. A wide cell (large B) will be necessary for stability when a
large head of water is to be resisted.
Other cell types, such as cloverleafs (Fig. 15-Ic) and ellipsoidal shapes (Fig. 15-26), may
be assembled from sheetpiling shapes and fabricated connections, depending on the purpose,
cell height (head of water), type of fill, amount of tolerable distortion, and location.
The cloverleaf type has been used considerably as a corner, or anchor, cell in conjunction
with circular cells. This cell can also be used to reduce the effective diameter of a cell when
a large cell width is required for stability against a high head of water.

15-1.4 General Cell Details
The basin-side piling may be 1 to 2 m shorter than the wet side, producing a slope across the
cell top (and fill) for some savings in steel mass. It is also possible to use a Z pile anchored wall
for the wet side of the diaphragm wall of Fig. 15-16 since water side piles are in compression.
The anchor rods, primarily for alignment, are attached to exterior wales and extend back
into the cell fill (or attach to the dry-side walls). Swatek (1967) described a wide range of
cofferdam configurations and heights; one should look at this publication prior to making a
design—particularly for unusual site conditions of large water head Hw or poor base soil.
The circular cell is generally preferable to the other cellular types for the following reasons:

1. It is stable as a single unit and can be filled as soon as it is constructed.
2. The diaphragm-type cell will distort unless the various units are filled essentially simul-
taneously with not over 0.5 to 0.75 m of differential soil height in adjacent cells; the use
of a circular diaphragm cell (Fig. 15-26) reduces this requirement if filling is first against
the concave wall side of Fig. 15-26 [Cushing and Moline (1975)].
3. The collapse of a diaphragm cell may cause the entire cofferdam to fail, whereas the
collapse of a circular cell is generally a local cell failure.
4. The circular cell is easier to form using templates.
5. The circular cell usually requires less sheetpiling, but this need depends somewhat on the
diaphragm crosswall spacing.


Increasing the size of a circular cofferdam cell does not necessarily increase the total quan-
tity of sheetpiling for the cofferdam, since the total number of cells will be reduced. This is
not true for the diaphragm-type cell. The quantity of cell fill depends directly on the cell
dimensions for all types of cofferdams.

15-1.5 Sand Islands
Sand islands are large circular cells, generally using fairly short sheetpiling, that are filled
with sand and sometimes capped with concrete. They provide a dry work area where the
water table is at or only 0.5-1 m above the existing ground surface.
A smaller sheeted excavation such as for a bridge pier may be constructed through this
small artificial island. Sand islands are usually left in place after construction; however, most
other cofferdams are removed and the sheeting stored for reuse or sold as used material.

15-1.6 Connections
The connections shown in Fig. 15-4 are all bolted. This step is necessary for economy and so
that driving does not cause separation of the parts. Fillet welds tend to fracture from driving
stresses and are seldom used. Fracture of built-up welded sections can be avoided by
1. Preheating the parts to be welded to about 5400C (about 10000F) so that the parts are
essentially fused together in welding. This high heat is seldom practical.
2. Using both longitudinal fillet welds and transverse slot welds. The slots should be spaced
on about 1-m staggered spacings and of the filled type (not filleted). This approach is costly
both because of the substantial amount of welding required and the great effort needed to
achieve proper notching of pieces so the slots are staggered. The slots would tend to keep
the fillet welds in joined pieces from slipping with respect to each other, and fracturing
during driving.

15-2 CELLFILL
The cell fill provides mass (or weight) for stability and a reduced coefficient of permeability
k for retaining water without excessive pumping. These advantages must be balanced against
the lateral pressure effects of the soil-water mixture and the resulting stresses that the sheet-
pile interlocks must resist before rupture and/or cofferdam failure.
For mass, it would be preferable to use a soil with a high density. For permeability consid-
erations alone, clay is the best possible fill. The earth-pressure coefficient of sand with a high
angle of internal friction (f) gives the minimum lateral pressure that must be resisted by hoop
tension in the interlocks, which usually controls cell design. Considering all these factors, the
best cell fill:

1. Is free-draining (large coefficient of permeability, k)
2. Has a high angle of internal friction, c/>
3. Contains small amounts of No. 200 sieve material—preferably less than 5 percent
4. Is resistant to scour (nonsilty or clayey)—requires presence of some gravel


Cell fills that do not meet these criteria are sometimes used, but the closer the fill material
approaches these criteria the more economical the design in terms of sheetpiling, which is
usually the most expensive portion of the cofferdam.
Cell fill is often placed hydraulically; i.e., the material is obtained from the river bottom
if at all possible. The material is dredged and pumped through a pipe system and discharged
into the cells, which are already driven, with the river level being the inside water line. This
operation may substantially reduce the fines, which are often present in river-bottom material
and which are temporarily suspended in the water and wash overboard. Of course, if material
is not available close by, fill may have to be brought in by barge, truck, or rail. In any case
the cell fill is generally deposited under water so the angle of internal friction 4> may not be
very large. It appears that this method of soil deposition seldom produces an angle of internal
friction over about 30° ± 2°.
Unless satisfactory drained triaxial tests can be performed on the soil and at the expected
cell density, the 0-angle should be limited to 28 to 30° for design (or preliminary design). It is
possible to increase the cell fill density and (f> by using some type of compaction with vibratory
equipment such as the Vibroflot or Terra-probe described in Sec. 6-5. If this is carefully done
{before any drawdown of water on the basin side) relative densities Dr on the order of 0.75
to 0.85 can be obtained with ^-angles in the range of 35 to 40°.

15-3 STABILITY AND DESIGN OF CELLULAR COFFERDAMS
The design of a cofferdam requires providing an adequate margin of safety against the fol-
lowing:

1. Cell sliding (Fig. 15-5a)
2. Cell overturning (Fig. 15-5Z?)
3. Cell bursting of Fig 15-5c, which is usually critical since the interlock (thumb and finger
joints) are the weakest part of the system.
4. Cell shear along the centerline and including a component of interlock friction as illus-
trated in Fig. 15-5J.
5. Bearing capacity and settlement (not shown)

There are no theoretical solutions for any of these five factors owing to the complex inter-
action of the cell geometry, sheet piles, and cell fill. Further complicating the analysis is the
transient state of water level outside and against the cell and the saturation line inside the cell
fill. Finally, in river environments there is the ever-present possibility of flooding and over-
topping. As a consequence of these uncertainties, cofferdam design is semi-empirical and
there are at least three design approaches to the problem, all of which have had a reasonably
successful design history. These methods are as follows:

1. Former Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) methods, also called Terzaghi's method
2. Cummings method
3. Hansen's (or Danish) method

Of these the TVA (1966, but publication now out of print) and Cummings (1960) methods
are commonly used in the United States and elsewhere. The Hansen method as modified by

Ovesen (1962) is used much less—primarily in Europe. More cofferdams have been built
by TVA and the U.S. Corps of Engineers than by any others. Thus, the TVA and Cummings
methods have much to commend them since, if one must use empirical methods, the simpler
ones are preferable. This is a major drawback of using the Hansen method—aside from there
being less construction experience to validate it. For these reasons it is not considered further
in this text; however, for the interested reader the method is outlined in Lacroix et al. (1970).
Dismuke (1975) provides a summary of the several design methods in use in the United
States, and Sorota and Kinner (1981) describe a recent use of the several U.S. design methods
in a major cofferdam installation. This latter reference provides instrumented data comparing
design to the as-built stresses and deformations; particularly valuable since there is not a great
deal of published postdesign verification available.

15-3.1 TVA Method of Cellular Cofferdam Design
Terzaghi (1945) presented a paper on cellular cofferdam design in which the methods used
by TVA in dam building along the Tennessee River since about 1935 were outlined. TVA
(1966) later published a monograph, with the first printing in 1957 having outlined in some
detail their design methods.
In the following discussion the unit weight of soil for all states will generally be used as
ys, but its numerical value will depend on its location in Fig. 15-6 (it may be dry, damp,

or saturated, with the effective value y')• The TVA method considers the following (refer to
Fig. 15-5 for factors and to Fig. 15-6 for terms).

SLIDING STABILITY. A cofferdam must provide adequate resistance to sliding on the base
caused by the unbalanced hydrostatic pressure. A sliding stability number N5 is defined (see
Fig. 15-5a), neglecting any active soil pressure, as
Ns = 

Pp + PJ* P " > 1.10 (15-2)
Pd
where Pf = friction on base as Wtan 8 + caB
Pd = driving force (usually outside water with Pw = \yWH^)
Pp = passive resistance (\y'sH^Kp) but may include a berm.
With a berm it is also necessary to estimate the location of the water surface
since the passive pressure is an effective stress computation but there is also
a berm water force of \ywH% where H'w = water depth on basin side (may
be from near top of berm or near top of excavation of depth Hs below existing
dredge line)

In this equation the active earth force Pa on the water side (not shown) is usually neglected
unless the embedment depth is more than about 1.75 m.
Use a Ns > 1.25 if this analysis controls the size of the cell.
Berms (Fig. 15-5«) may be used to increase sliding resistance. The berm, being limited
in plan, may not fully develop passive pressure, so it might be best analyzed using the trial
wedge method of Sec. 11-12.1. For a sloping berm one can use the Coulomb Kp with a neg-
ative /3 angle. If the berm has a shelf (broken backslope) and a slope on the order of about
3H: 1V or larger, the berm may be analyzed as a sliding mass of some weight and appropriate
friction coefficient tan S between berm and base.
A problem with berms is the location of the passive resistance. Although one may take
this as H1J?) or Hs/3 from the bottom, this is not likely correct. One might use the sheet-pile
program FADSPABW to locate the center of resisting pressure and its magnitude.
It is often better to increase the cell diameter rather than to use a berm (an increase in
diameter is not directly related to the increase in number of sheet piles required). The berm
increases the required basin space, so some economy is achieved by increasing the cell di-
ameter and possibly using a smaller basin.
If a berm must be used it is preferable to use the existing soil, i.e., leave that part of the
basin unexcavated rather than excavating and backfilling—unless the dredged soil is totally
unsuitable. If the excavation does not produce sufficient berm height, use as much of the
excavated soil as practical to increase the berm height.

OVERTURNING STABILITY. The cofferdam must be stable against overturning. Two pos-
sibilities, or types of analysis, can be made when considering this type of stability. To avoid
overturning, and reasoning that soil cannot take tension forces, we see that the resultant
weight W should lie within the middle one-third of the base (see Fig. 15-5Z?) giving

(a)


Thus, larger cell heights H require wider average cell widths B defined by the equiva-
lent rectangle of Fig. 15-1. The unit weight y used in Eq. (a) is understood from previous
discussion as the average for the cell.
Alternatively, one may reason that as the cell tends to tip over, the soil will pour out at the
heel. For this to occur the friction resistance between the cell fill and the water-side sheet-
piling must develop from the water force Pd = Pw. Summing moments about the toe of the
cell (point A of Fig. \5-5b) gives
BP w tan S = Pwy
and the required average width B is

where 8 = angle of friction between cell fill and steel and may be estimated at about 0.6 to
0.70 or from Table 11-6. The stability number Not is
Not = B t m (about 1.1 to 1.25) (15-3)
y
If the sheetpiling is embedded to some depth in the soil, the effects of the active Pa and
passive Pp soil pressures on the overturning moment and friction resistance should be in-
cluded in summing moments about point A in Eq. (b).
This Not stability check is not now used by TVA (1966, see Foreword) since the mode is
highly unlikely, but it is not a difficult check and probably should be continued.

CELL SHEAR. Shear along a plane through the centerline of the cell is another possible
mode of failure (Fig. 15-6«). For stability, the shearing resistance along this plane, which is
the sum of soil shear resistance and resistance in the interlocks, must be equal to or greater
than the shear due to the overturning effects. Referring to Fig. 15-5d and assuming a linear
pressure distribution across the base of the cell, we have
M0 = ]BV
and solving for the vertical shear force V we obtain
V = 1.5 M JB (15-4)
For stability the resisting shear Vr > V.
Since Vr depends on both interlock resistance Rn and cell shear along the center line V5,
it is necessary to obtain their values so that
Vr = Vs + Rn > V (15-5)

Soil shear resistance. The soil shear resistance part of the total cell shear resistance is com-
puted from Fig. 15-6a as
Vs = Ps tan 8 (15-5«)
with Ps = area of pressure profile abed. The location of the resultant y is not required.
The earth-pressure coefficient K' may be computed using the Mohr's circle construction of
Fig. 15-7—which may not be correct. Figure 15-7 was developed by Krynine in his discussion
of Terzaghi's 1945 paper [Terzaghi (1945)] and was based on the idea that the cell centerline


Figure 15-7 The method suggested by
Krynine in his discussion of the Terzaghi
(1945) paper to compute the earth pressure
coefficient K' for vertical shear along the
cell centerline.

Shear stress T

is not a principal stress plane but at any centerline depth Z1 there is a vertical stress CD = yzu
which produces a horizontal stress of ynK' and a shear stress T. From a Mohr's circle and
using the trigonometric relationships shown in Fig. 15-7 we produce the desired equation for
K' as
K' = ^ 8 * * (15-6)
2 - cos2 $
Since this equation gave K' > Ka for the same angle, the readers (and Terzaghi) assumed
it was correct. No one immediately noticed that although it gave K' > Ka for increasing </>-
angles, it also gave smaller ^'-values for increasing ^-angles, which was clearly not correct.
It has since been postulated that Eq. (15-6) is not correct since the lateral stress on the cell
centerline was developed both by cell soil and the lateral force Pd of Fig. 15-5a.
The following table is instructive. It tabulates the foregoing discussion for a rapid compar-
ison. In the table we will use a constant H, vary both <f> and ys, and compute both the Rankine
Ka and K' as shown:

The table uses unit weights consistent with the increase in the angle of internal friction <f).
In the commonly used range of (/> from 30 to 34° there is only about an 8 percent increase in
shear resistance on the centerline. This table indicates that the earth-pressure coefficient K'
from Eq. (15-6) is adequate if correctly used.
The use of </> = 30° is probably not realistic for a sandy soil deposited under water and
given a modest amount of vibration by a Terra-probe [a round pipe firmly attached to a vibrat-

ing pile driver, which is slowly driven into the cell soil (including the base soil if possible)
and pulled with a crane while still vibrating] or the like. An ordinary concrete vibrator can
be used if it has a sufficiently long probe.
It is suggested that using K' = 0.45 to 0.50 is a good compromise instead of using Eq.
(15-6). The author suggests values of K' between 0.45 and 1.0 (0.45 at 30° and 1.0 at about
40°).
Maitland and Schroeder (1979) suggested using K' = 1; however, the author found that
using 0.56 gave the best moment resistance comparison for that case. Sorota et al. (1981)
suggest K' = 0.35 to 0.40 for compacted well-graded granular soils, which seems somewhat
low. Since there is no universal agreement on what to use for the effective cell height (see /3,
Fig. 15-6£>, c) it is reasonable that there is no agreement on what to use for K'.
The cell environment is such that precise attempts to identify the soil state are not justified.
A rain can easily saturate the top zone (unless capped). In flood stages the cells may become
overtopped regardless of freeboard (see Fig. 15-11); however, overtopping may not be critical
since the interior, or dry side, is likely to fill before cell saturation occurs. If it is possible that
cell saturation could occur first, some systems have deliberately provided a flood gate to
ensure the basin fills before the cells saturate and possibly burst.

Interlock friction/shear. Friction in the interlock joints (see Fig. 15-8) occurs simultane-
ously with soil shear resistance for vertical shear distortion along the centerline to take place.
Conventional design uses the average interlock tension based on using Pt of Fig. 15-6« or b.
Here the lateral force (for a unit of width) is
Pt = areaafocd (15-7)
Note the use of Ka for the lateral pressure here and not Kf. The interlock friction resistance
contribution is
Rn = Ptfi (15-56)

The total cell shear resistance combines Eqs. (15-5«) and (15-5fo) for the circular cell to
obtain Eq. (5-5), given earlier and repeated here:
Vr = Vs + Rif < V (15-5)
Carefully note that Vs in Eq. (15-5) is per unit of width, and the computation for Ra is also
in per unit of width.
The stability number against cell shear Ncs is defined as
N™ = Y = ~ ^ U to 1.25 (15-8)

BURSTING STABILITY. The cells must be stable against bursting pressures (pulling apart
of the piles at the joints).

Interlock tension. Experiences at the TVA and elsewhere indicate that during filling of the
cell, lateral pressures develop during filling and increase during subsequent consolidation of
the fill (on the order of 10 days or so). The cell expands in proportion to the lateral pressure
but expansion is dependent on the base restraint—whether the cell is founded on rock or
embedded in the ground. The expanded cell takes on a modified barrel or bulged shape, and
field observation finds the bulge most pronounced at from one-fifth to one-third of the free
height of the cell above the dredge line or rock. On this basis the TVA uses HjA for cells on
rock to the maximum bulge. This point is also most critical for interlock tension.
Maitland and Schroeder (1979) suggest finding this point as one-third of the modified cell
height H\, which is based on the depth of fixity df below the dredge line when the cell is
embedded in soil (or not driven to rock), to obtain


where Hc = free cell height (see Fig. 15-6Z? for Hc and df).
The location of the depth of fixity df can be estimated two ways:

Method 1.

1. Compute the inside effective lateral pressure at the dredge line inside the cell as pa.
2. Compute the estimated depth of fixity df in sand as the point of zero pressure (also zero
deflection) using
d> - ySFiu <15'9)
where y' = effective unit weight below the outside dredge line
Kp, Ka = Rankine passive and active earth-pressure coefficients for the soil below
the dredge line

If the dredge line soil has 4> = 0, use df ~ 0.3 to 0.5 m.
Method 2. Use your program FADSPABW and a pressure profile computed as q^ = yeffx Zi
for the depth Hc. Now adjust qn for the pile width (not a unit width); use the moment of inertia
for the single sheet pile. Now code the piling (use fairly long elements above the dredge
line, because they are not critical; define the JTSOIL node and use short nodes below the
dredge line. Make a trial and see what you get. You may have to increase the pile depth or
let the program increment it. If this analysis is done, you may find that the initial trial cell
embedment depth should be increased—if so, increase the depth and try again. Now from the
output sheets plot the location of zero displacement and measure this from the dredge line as
df-
An estimate of the lateral subgrade modulus in the embedment part of the pile must be
made. Note, however, that the HjA location shown in Fig. 15-6c is commonly used and is
probably as accurate as the <f> and y being used; there is not a great deal of difference in the
design whether you use the HjA or the HJ3 locations. If you do not elect to find df, then use
H1 = Hc.
The pressure intensity qt = ce of Figs, \5-6b or 15-6c is used for the critical interlock
tension t[ and with reference to Fig. 15-8& is computed as follows:

Appendix A Tables A-3a and A-3b give the profiles and additional section properties of the
sections rolled in the United States and select sections rolled in Europe to supplement the
data in Table 15-1.


The designer can, of course, use any other pressure profile deemed more suitable than those
of Fig. 15-6Z?, c along with whatever value is selected for the earth pressure coefficient Ka.
One possible choice is to use a parabolic distribution, which gives approximately a one-third
increase in the hoop tension.
Both the model cells of Maitland and Schroeder (1979) and the prototype cells of Sorota
et al. (1981) show that when the basin (work area) side is dewatered the interlock tensions
increase in the range of 20 to 25 percent on the basin side. Simultaneously the interlock
tensions decrease on the river side. The reason is probably that the cell, acting as a large
gravity-retaining structure, produces a compression arch on the river side, which tends to
open the basin side sheets. Since this loading stage is only one of several to which the cell is
subjected, it is not generally feasible to use, say, lower strength interlocks on the river side.
The cell location during filling also affects the bursting pressure qt\ a cell near the shore
will—during and shortly after filling—be subjected to both the maximum qw and a maximum
effective earth pressure qsh. This increase is compensated somewhat by the near-shore cell's
usually having smaller Hc. Cells in the water will undergo only active effective earth pressure
until dewatering.
Most cofferdam failures result from failure of the connecting tee from either a fabrication
failure or interlock failure [Swatek (1967), Grayman (1970)]. According to the TVA (1966)
the interlock tension of the connection pieces can be computed from the free body of the cell
as shown in Fig. 15-9. Summation offerees gives the interlock tension in the connection as
T[t — qtL/cos a (15-11)
In this equation L = \U of Fig. 15-la and Fig. 15-9. The maximum interlock tension can
be reduced by decreasing a, which may require use of a 30° Y instead of a 90° T in order to
obtain a reasonable width of connecting arc.
One may obtain the maximum tension force from a free body diagram that considers hoop
tension in both the main and connecting cells; however, both TVA (1966, p. 112) and Dismuke
(1970) show that approximately the same value is obtained from using Eq. (15-11). Rossow
(1984) made a theoretical analysis of the interlock tension at the connection joint, but the
results were of little value because too many assumptions were used.
There is some opinion that Eq. (15-11) may be overly conservative, but the results reported
by Sorota et al. (1981) did not indicate this. Also note that there is a wide range in possible
ri t values, depending on what is assumed for the instant depth of water in the cell and what
is used for the active earth pressure coefficient Ka. For example, using a good-quality gran-
ular cell fill with a modest amount of compaction to increase </> from 30 to 36° (probably more

nearly correct) produces a 28 percent stress reduction between the Rankine Ka for 30° and
Ka for 36°.

15-3.2 The Cummings Method (Currently Used by TVA)
Cummings (1960) proposed a method of analysis of cellular cofferdams based on model stud-
ies for the tilting of a cofferdam on rock, as shown in Fig. 15-10. The method provides a
simple analysis; however, the models were constructed of relatively stiff material for the size
of the model, which may not be realistic when related to the flexible sheetpiling sections and
dimensions of a field structure.
According to TVA (1966), they had made some (unpublished) model studies similar (and
prior) to Cummings and observed the same type of failures. It remained for Cummings to
develop the analytical method presented here. The method has been successfully used in the
design of several cofferdams and is extremely simple.
The analysis is based on the premise that the cell soil will resist lateral distortion of the cell
through the buildup of soil resistance to sliding on horizontal planes (Fig. 15-10Z?). This resis-
tance will be developed in a triangle as shown, forming an angle of <f> to the horizontal. The
triangle of soil will be in a passive pressure state and stabilized by the overlying soil, which
acts as a surcharge. The weight of this soil is termed Wy. The derivation is complete when
we can write an expression for the cell resistance in terms of the triangular zone of passive
resistance, with shear on the horizontal planes and including the surcharge effect of Wy.

Referring to Fig. 15-1Oc, we see that the weight of soil overlaying the triangle, in zone
defg, plus the weight of the soil included in the triangle efh is
Wi = ya(ci + y)y coicf) (a)
where ya = average effective unit weight of cell soil as a computational convenience; it can
have two values if the cell is embedded in the dredge line soil (refer to Example 15-4).
The shear resistance developed by Wi along the horizontal plane /z/with 5 = </> is
R = Witon4> = ya(ay + y2) (b)
The maximum value of R occurs when y is a maximum. This occurs when
y = c = Btancf) (c)
The geometry of the problems yields, by inspection,
a = H-c (d)
Now substituting the values from Eq. (c) for y and Eq. (d) for a, and Eq. (a) for W\ into Eq. (b)
and defining Rmax = maximum force, we obtain
tfmax = JaBHt^W(J) (e)
The force R of Eq. (b) can be interpreted as consisting of two parts, R\ and R2 (see Fig.
15-1Od) and from Eq. (b) and using Eq. (c) forc = B tan 0 for y these two forces are
R1 = yaa • c R2 = yac2 if)
The force R\ is taken as the area of a rectangle of height c and base yaa. Force R2 is the
area of a triangle of height c and base 2yac. This concept is used so that resisting moments
can be computed for these two forces as
M1 = R1J1 = RXC- M2 = R2J2 = R2C- (g)

and the total soil resisting moment Mr is
M1. = Mx+ M2 (K)
Rewriting and substituting Eqs.(/) and (g) into Eq. (Ji), we find the total soil resisting moment
is
Mr = yac2(^+C-) (15-12)

The bending resistance of the piles due to interlock effects (Fig. 15-1Oe) is computed from
the bursting pressure
T = l-yaH2Kar = Pr (i)
For a unit strip (or for cell width L) the width is number of piles n X pile width b\, giving
the total resisting moment from cell fill on either a unit strip or width L as

but


This expression gives the total resisting moment Mix from soil and pile as
Aftr = Mr + M"
/ \ (15-13)
Mir = yac2y^+C-yPfB
The stability number against overturning N00 is the ratio of the cell resisting moments to
the overturning moments

Stability against sliding in the Cummings method is computed the same as by Eq. (15-2)
and for interlock tension by Eqs. (15-10) or (15-11).

15-4 BEARINGCAPACITY
Bearing capacity does not have to be considered when cofferdams are founded on rock.
When cells are based on soil, bearing capacity may be a problem. This can be investigated
as follows:

1. Convert the cofferdam to an equivalent rectangle (see Fig. 15-1).
2. Use a unit width for foundation width B (= 1) and an initial length L equal to equivalent
rectangle B.
3. Using the overturning stability computations find the base eccentricity e.
4. Compute the effective foundation U = L- 2e.
5. Use the Hansen bearing-capacity equations with the effective base dimensions of B X L'
to compute the bearing capacity, and compare to the actual bearing pressure under the toe
half of the base. Compute depth dt and inclination factors /,-, but note that all Si = I.
What you are doing is computing a bearing capacity that makes some allowance for the
increase in soil pressure from the overturning effect of the water.

15-5 CELL SETTLEMENT
Cells on rock do not settle. Probably cells on soil do not settle unless the base soil is extremely
poor, or the cell is in place so long that consolidation settlements occur.
The apparent settlement, however, can be very large and will be illustrated by the following
example.
Example 15-1. Estimate the apparent settlement of the cofferdam cell shown in Fig. E15-1. It is
assumed that we can somehow measure the increases in cell diameter as given so that we can make
an approximate analysis.
Solution. From the new diameters compute an average diameter and (as done in unconfined com-
pression tests) assume the volume remains constant. The initial diameter is the as-driven cell diam-
eter of 6.0 m and cell height Hc = 6 m (above dredge line). Compute the new cell diameter (after
it expands from dewatering the basin side) as

(average bulged diameter)


Figure E15-1

The initial cell volume based on H = 8 m is
V1 = 0.7854 X 62(8) = 226.2 m3
The final volume is assumed to equal V1 or
0.7854 X 6.12Hf = 226.2

Hf = 0.7854 X 6.72 = 6 - 4 2 m

The apparent settlement is

A// = 8.00 - 6.42 = 1.58 m
Not all of this apparent settlement would occur at once—part would occur during cell filling. It
should also be evident that one could go from one cell expansion to another using the same procedure
to obtain "settlements" at various stages of dewatering or other activities.

15-6 PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN CELLULAR
COFFERDAM DESIGN
The 10-mm (0.40-in., and formerly |-in.) web sheetpiling is widely used for cofferdam
design, providing a guaranteed tension of 2800 kN/m (16 kips/in.) and an interlock stress
of 280 MPa (40 ksi)—approximately fy for A328 steel. Using a nominal SF = 1.5 on the


interlock tension, we obtain 2800/1.5 = 1870 kN/m and the corresponding web stress =
T/tw = 1870/0.01 = 187000 kPa = 187 MPa. The latter is close to the value of fa =
0.65 fy given in the heading of Table 15-1.
For substantial embedment depths, such as for cellular cofferdams not on rock, it may be
necessary to increase the web thickness to 12.7 mm. It is not usually recommended to drive
sheetpiling much over 3 to 5 m (10 to 15 ft) with 6 m as an upper practical limit owing to
driving damage since soil in river beds at these depths usually becomes sandy and dense so
that driving becomes difficult. It is usually desirable to excavate 1 to 2 m of overburden to
remove surface debris such as stumps, logs, tires, etc., which may damage the sheetpiling if
large embedment depths are necessary.
Secondhand sheetpiling is widely used. It may be reused as many as four times, which
represents about 25 percent loss from each use. It is for this reason that former as well as
current designations for sheet-pile sections are given in Table 15-1. A major consideration
with used sheetpiling is damage to the thumb and finger elements that produce the interlock
groove. It is absolutely essential that the interlock be correctly done as illustrated in Fig.
\5-4a (dashed), for a thumb reversal greatly reduces the interlock tension and may open up
the groove. Other damage may also occur from rust, wedging a stone, kinking the pile, hard
driving, and so forth.
For important projects it may be advisable to require either new piling or that the con-
tractor be responsible for any cofferdam failure that arises from driving used piling.
Cofferdam dewatering is necessary to reduce the hoop tension stresses—which usually
control the design—and it is standard practice to burn holes of about 35- to 50-mm diameter
through several of the cell piles in each cell on the basin side. Practice is to burn the weep
holes at about 1.5- to 2-m centers vertically on every third to sixth sheet pile (weep holes on
the same pile result in maximum salvage of piling). Holes are made to the top of the berm or
to the inside ground surface if no berm is used. During dewatering operations it is necessary
that the drain or weep holes be systematically rodded to maintain drainage.
It appears that one cannot rely on drainage through the interlocks to dewater the cells
adequately; the interlocks tend to "silt up" during the cell-filling operation. They also tighten
when the cell bulges, which also reduces water flow. If the dewatering is carefully done and
the cell fill is free-draining, TVA experience (1966, p. 118) indicates that it is satisfactory to
assume a horizontal saturation line at one-half the free interior cell height.
Assuming a horizontal saturation line location greatly simplifies the design computations
(Fig. 15-1 Ia). Wells may be installed in the cells adjacent to the dry-side sheeting to collect
water, which can then drain through any nearby weep holes. Alternatively, wells of 200- to
300-mm diameter (Fig. 15-%) may be installed on both the river and basin side of the cell
together with well pumps to aid in dewatering and to depress the saturation line further. Pump
capacities on the order of 10 to 40 gal/min—depending on the drainage characteristics of the
cell fill—are commonly required.
If the cells are located in very poor soils it may be possible to use stone columns (described
in Sec. 6-8) to stabilize both the base and cell soil.
If cells are high, it may be possible to drive soldier piles of the type shown in Fig. \3-6b on
a spacing to accommodate anywhere from three to six straight web piles. The cell template
would have to be redesigned to accommodate the H pile sections.
Cell bulge may be avoided by cutting undersized circles of geogrids and using special
lowering devices to position a layer until it is well-covered with fill, raising the positioning
device to a higher level, installing a second geogrid,..., etc. If the grid openings are properly
aligned, a Terra-probe or concrete vibrator may be used to densify the soil.


Figure 15-11 Location of the saturation (phreatic) line inside cofferdams. The average saturation line in (a) is
probably as accurate as any, however, the alternative saturation line slopes (use an average for them also) may
be required in some designs. Cell wells as in (b) may lower the saturation line close to the cell base if properly
constructed and in sufficient number.

It was previously discussed that an inside berm may be used to obtain additional sliding
resistance. It may also be used to increase the length of flow path to reduce the possibility of
piping or excessive flow beneath the cofferdam. In this case, however, it is usually preferable
to put wells in the cell and pump the head down so that the flow through and beneath the
cofferdam is acceptable.
Cofferdams are built with a freeboard depth on the order of 1.5 to perhaps 2 m (Fig.
15-1 Ia), usually based on a 5-year design period. It is usually considered more economi-
cal to allow for overtopping during an extreme flood than to design for a longer flood period
(10 to 50 years).
Inclusion of overtopping considerations can quickly change design parameters unless pro-
vision is made for rapid flooding of the basin. Also overtopping can result in severe erosion
of the cell fill. The cell fill may be capped with a lean (14-21 MPa) concrete mix (on the
order of 150 to 200 mm thick) or with an asphalt mix. Since cell fill settlement/subsidence
can approach 600 mm (or more) asphalt, being flexible, may be a better capping material
than concrete to control both cracking and surface water infiltration.
Even if overtopping does not occur, the river bed tends to scour, or erode, during floods. If
this occurs beneath the cell piling on the river side, the cell(s) tip into the river. Some means
to monitor toe scour should be provided because equipment is often stored on top of the cells
and could be lost if the cells tip over.

The cofferdam often will carry construction equipment such as cranes and otherwise be
surcharged with stockpiles of cell fill, sheetpiling for later cells, etc. Very large surcharges
should be considered in the cell design.
Most reported cofferdam failures appear due to failure of the connection element (tee or
wye) between the main cell and the connecting arc. Some of the earlier failures were from us-
ing welded connections that fractured. Grayman (1970) summarized a number of cofferdam
failures as to cause, and only one failure was attributed to sliding and one to overturning.
Finally, the cells cannot be aligned during driving to much more than about 150 mm owing
to the flexible sheeting involved and to the problems in driving and the process of filling and
dewatering. Later cell distortions may produce vertical settlement/subsidence already noted
of 300 to 1000 mm or more. The system always moves into the basin some amount ranging
from almost zero to perhaps 150 mm at the base and from 75 to perhaps 300+ mm at the top.
Noticeable bulges nearly always develop in the cell—probably all around but visible on the
basin (or cofferdam side). AU of these happenings are considered acceptable practice.
COMPUTER PROGRAMMING. It should be evident that there is a substantial amount of
busywork involved with a cofferdam design. Thus, there is a high possibility of errors, so a
computer program should be used for the analysis if one is available. Program COFERDAM
is one such program. These types of programs generally require an interactive mode since
there are a number of options such as absence or presence of a berm, water height in berm,
location of saturation line, use of passive and/or active pressures, and so on.

15-7 DESIGN OF DIAPHRAGM COFFERDAM CELL
This section will consider the design of a diaphragm cell. Both design and required as-built
values and volume of cell fill are examined.
Example 15-2. Design a diaphragm cofferdam cell. Assume the cell saturation line to be at one-
half the cell height from the rock base to the top. This assumption allows for a small flood rise of
0.6 m (0.6 m = freeboard) at incipient overtopping as shown in Fig. E15-2<s. The soil data are also
shown in this figure, along with select initial dimensions and depth of dredge line soil to the rock
base.
Other data: Use either PS27.5 or PS31 piling of grade A 328.
fy = 270MPa (if possible)
Interlock tension T1 = 2800 kN/m
SF = 2.0 (Table 15-1)
Interlock friction ft = 0 . 3
Friction of pile-soil fs = 0.4 (Table 11-6)

Solution.
Step 1. Find a width B of Fig. 15-Ib to satisfy sliding stability.
There will be a water force based on the cell height and, since the embedment depth is 5.5 m,
a small active earth-pressure force. The water has Ka = 1.0; for a soil of (f> = 30° the Rankine
Ka = 0.333 (Table 11-3). The lateral forces are as follows:

above base

Figure E15-2a Diaphragm Cell.

With the saturation line at one-half the cell height, or 15.25/2 = 7.625 m, the weight W of a strip 1
unit (1 m) wide in terms of cell width 5 is
W = Bys X 15.25/2 + By's X 15.25/2
= 5(17.3 + 7.5) x 7.625 = 189.15 kN
The sliding resistance is W tan 8 —» W tan cf), giving
Fsr(189.15tan30°) = 189.1Bx 0.577 = 109.15
For a sliding stability number Ns = 1.25, we obtain the effective cell width
109.15 = SF(PW + Pa)
1.25(1140.4 + 37.8) „ mt%
B = 109.1 ^ = 1 3 - 5 « m
Step 2. Find the width 5 necessary for overturning stability. Take moments about cell base at point
O:
M0 = Pwyw + Pays = 1140.4 X 5.08 + 37.8 X 1.83 = 5862.4 kN • m
We will arbitrarily keep the base eccentricity within the middle one-third, giving
e =% and We = M0 X SF

With W = 109.15 and SF = 1.25, we obtain on substitution into the foregoing

B = n 7 8 : 2 x 0 . 4 0 - 1 5 - 5 5 m > 1 5 2 9 Use« = 15.55 

m
Step 3. Check centerline shear. For this we need to refer to Fig. E15-2Z? and c, which gives the
necessary pressure profiles for this check. We will assume r = L (see Fig. 15-Ib).
The pressure profiles show the necessary computations using the method given in Chap. 11 for
pressure at critical depths. Note, however, that Fig. E15-2Z? uses a lateral earth-pressure coefficient
K'. Equation (15-6) gives K' = 0.60 for </> = 30° [see table following Eq. 15-6]; the author sug-
gested 0.45. The average of K' and Ka « 0.45 (a coincidence for </> = 30°). We will use K' = 0.45
to compute the pressures in Fig. E15-22? (but Ka = 0.333 for Fig. E15-2c).
The centerline shear is computed using Eq. (15-4) and M0 from step two as
V = L5MO/B = 1.5(5862.4)/15.55 - 565.5 kN
The resisting shear is made up of Ps tan (f> + R^. From Fig. E15-2& we compute Ps as follows:
Ps = 56.61^- + (56.6 + ^ ) x 7.625
= 215.8 + 529.6 = 745.4 kN/m
Vs = Pstmcf) = 745.4 X 0.577 = 430.1 kN/m
For the interlock resistance Ra we use Fig. E15-2c and compute the area abed = Pt so we can
use Eq. (15-56) [see after Eq. (15-7)]:

Saturation line


Substituting values, we obtain
Pt = 41.9 x 3.813 + ( 8 ° ^ 4 L 9 ) x 3.813 + 88.8 x 1.91
= 159.8 + 249.2 + 169.3 = 578.3 kN
and using Eq. (15-5Z?), we have
R[l = Pj1 = 578.5 X 0.3 = 173.6 kN
Vr = Vs + Rn = 430.1 + 173.6 = 603.6 kN > 565.5
The resulting SF = 603.6/565.5 = 1.07 < 1.25
Noting the sliding and overturning stability numbers are satisfactory for the B value being used,
we see that any larger B will only increase those stability numbers. Let us increase B so the cell
shear stability is at least 1.25. We can do this by increasing B as follows:
1.5MO _ Vr 1.5X 5862.4 x 1.25 _ 1 8 2 m > 1 c c ,
~B~ " SF B 603^ 1 8 ' 2 m > 1 5 5 5
Step 4. Check interlock tension using crt of Fig. E15-2c and Eq. (15-10). We do not need to check
Eq. (15-11) since a 120° Y in a diaphragm cell produces the same interlock tension in any part of
the cell.
Using Eq. (15-10) we will back-compute to find a suitable wall spacing r = L,
_ atr _ 2800
u ~ ~c ~ atr ~ ~sF
Substituting values, we obtain (crt = 88.8 kPa on Fig. E15-2c)
88.8r = 2800/2-* r = 1600/88.8 = 15.8 m
We will arbitrarily reduce this value and use r = L = 15.0 m.
We now have design dimensions for this cell as follows:
B = 18.2 m r = L = 15.0 m Cell height Hc = 15.25 m
Step 5. Compute the required number of piles and final cell dimensions (we cannot use fractions of
piles, and we must use what is available both for piles and the Y piece). From Fig. 13-4J the legs
of a typical Y = 260.4 mm -> 0.260 m. The central angle of all diaphragm cells is 60° = 1.047
radians. Both PS27.5 and PS31 piles have a driving distance (width) bp = 500 mm (0.50 m).
a. Plot the computed dimensions to a large scale (as in Fig. E\5-2d) and scale the wall length
~ 17.3 m. This is reduced by two Y legs of 0.260 m
No. of piles = [17.3 - 2(0.260)]/0.5 = 16.78/0.5 = 34 piles
Side wall Lw = 34 X 0.5 + 0.52 = 17.52 m (actual distance)
b. Get piles in the arc. The initial arc length is
L8n. = rd = 15.0(1.047) = 15.70 m
No. of piles = (15.70 - 0.52)/0.5 = 30.36 use 31 piles
Actual L ^ = 31 X 0.5 + 0.52 = 16.02 m
Actual r = L2xJQ = 16.02/1.047 = 15.3 m
c. Actual effective B (refer to Fig. 15-IZ?) is approximately


Figure E15-2</

Eliminating A, we obtain 0.088r = B - 17.52. Solving, we see that
B = 17.52 + 0.088(15.3) = 18.87 m
Since this is larger than the last computed B = 18.82 it appears that the computations are satis-
factory. The full cell width
B' = Lw + 2(r-rcos30°)
= 17.52 + 2(15.3 - 15.3 cos 30°)
= 17.52 + 4.10 = 21.62 m

d. The number of piles/cell is based on 1 side wall + 2 end arcs, giving
Side wall = 34 piles
2 end arcs = 2 X 31 = 62 piles
Total = 96 piles + two 1200Ys
e. The approximate cell fill volume above the dredge line is
Vfiu = BrH = 18.87 X 15.3 X 9.75 « 2815 m3

15-8 CIRCULAR COFFERDAM DESIGN
This section considers the design of a circular cell cofferdam on a soil base using the TVA
method. The following example will illustrate both the current TVA and the Cumming's
methods for analysis.

Example 15-3. Design a circular cofferdam cell resting on a riverbed sand stratum approximately
25 m thick using the current TVA method. Other data are as follows (refer also to Fig. E15-3a):

All SF > 1.25. Neglect dynamic force of river flow.

Solution. (To minimize errors, I used the program COFERDAM to check the following computa-
tions.)
Step 1. Compute the driving forces and the overturning moment. These several forces and y loca-
tions, shown on Fig. E15-3a, are computed using methods given in Chap. 13:
Pw = \ywH2 = | x 9.807 X 22.52 = 2482.4 kN/m <-
P'w = \ x 9.807 X 32 = 44.1 kN/m ->
The soil below the dredge line has y' = 19.2 - 9.807 = 9.4 kN/m, and for </> = 34° we can look
up K1 values from Tables 11-3 and 4:

Fill:


Referring to directions of the arrows and (+) = <—, we see that the net force is
Pnet = 2482.4 + 21.3 - 44.1 - 266.0 = 2193.6 kN/m <-
The net overturning moment M0 is computed using the foregoing forces with their y values, giving
M0 = 2482.4 X 7.5 + 21.3 X 1.33 - 44.1 X 1.0 - 266.0 X 1.33
= 18 248.4 kN • m/m (counterclockwise ^ )
Step 2. Cell centerline shear usually controls, so we will compute the B required for this (keeping
the eccentricity in the middle one-third) and then check overturning and sliding stability:
V = L5MO/B [Eq. (15-4)]
Vs = P, tan 5 [Eq. (15-5«)]
V = VS + Rti [Eq. (15-5)]
Rn = Pi fi [Eq. (15-5«]
Obtain Ps from the pressure profile shown in Fig. E15-3Z? and compute Rn using either Pt from
Fig. E15-3c or P't from Fig. E15-3d. Here we will compute both values of Pt and use the smaller.
For Ps it is necesssary to compute a value of K' and, based on its value, make a selection in the
range of 0.45 to 1.0. Using Eq. (15-6), we obtain
cos2 32° 0-719
K = 2-cos* 32° = 2-0.719 = a 5 6 1
We will arbitrarily use K' = 0.60. With this the pressure profile of Fig. E15-3Z? is drawn. Select
lateral pressure computations are on the diagram. Compute Ps as
P j = 1 0 2 0 x m + ( 1 0 Z 0 ± m 0 ± 4 5 : 9 ) x 8 5

= 510.0 + 1062.1 = 1572.1 kN/m
Vs = Ps tan 32° = 1572.1 tan 32° = 982.3 kN/m [Eq. (15-5a)]
The value of Pt = 1110.2 kN/m is shown on Fig. E15-3c, and you should be able to compute this
using the pressure profile given. Let us look at Fig. E 15-3d. This profile uses the depth of fixity
suggested by Maitland and Shroeder (1979), as modified by the author.
The lateral pressure pa is at the dredge line + dz where <fr = 34° so Ka = 0.283 and
Pa = (ys x 10 + y' x 8.5)0.283
= (17.0 X 10 + 9.0 X 8.5)0.283 = 69.8 kPa
Summing pressures, we find
dfy'Kp - dfy'Ka = pa [Eq. (15-9) slightly rearranged]
d = Pa = 6 9 - 8 = 2 3 n i
f y'{K
p-Ka) 9.4(3.537-0.283)
The total effective pile depth Hx = 10 + 8.5 + 2.3 = 20.8 m. The maximum stress is assumed to
act at 20.8/3 = 6.9 m above this point, giving the dimensions and stresses shown on Fig. E15-3d.
From the stresses and dimensions compute P\ as

We can now compute the average cell width B:

Replacing the < with an equal sign and introducing the SF = 1.25, we obtain
D l.5MoSF 1.5 X 18 248.4 X 1.25 „ .
B = — P T " = 12551 =
Step 3. Check sliding stability. The weight W of a unit width slice X B is
W = (10 X 17.0 + 8.5 X 9.0 + 4 X 9.4)5 = 284.1B kN/m
The net driving force tending to slide the cell into the basin was computed earlier as Pd = 2193.6
kN/m. The resulting stability number Ns when we insert B = 27.3 m (just computed) is

Step 4. Check the interlock tension both in the cell piles and at the Ts or Ys. For the cell piles use
Eq. (15-10) with C = I , giving
U = qtr
(Obtain g, = 101.2 from Fig. E\5-3d.) The diameter D « B/0.875 = 27.3/0.875 = 31.2 m. Thus,
r = D/2 = 31.2/2 = 15.6 m
Substitution into Eq. (15-10) now gives
U = 101.2 X 15.6 = 1578.7 < 2800/2 (O.K.)
For Eq. (15-11) we need a value L shown on Fig. \5-la:2L = 2.25r.
L = 1.125r = 1.125 X 15.6 = 17.55 m
Substitution into Eq. (15-11) with L = V gives
TiL = qtL/cosa = 101.2 X 17.55/cos45° = 2511 kN/m > 2800/2
We might be able to use 4900/2 = 2400 kN/m interlock. If we use a = 30°, TiL = 2051 kN/m.
This result is acceptable using high-strength interlocks. Alternatively, we could use a berm or
install wells and lower the saturation line to near the inside dredge line. Depending on the number
of cells it may be most economical to pay a premium for high-strength interlocks. These are only
needed for the 30° Y pieces at four per cell.
Check the web tension based on using the PS31 pile with tw = 12.7 mm (0.0127 m). Then
ft = 101.2 X 15.6/12.7 = 124.3MPa <K 0.65/, of A328 steel
StepS. Check the bearing capacity. For the base soil y' = 9.4; 0 = 34°; from Table 4-4 Nq = 29A;
Ny = 28.7; depth factor = 0.262. Also H = Pd = 2194 kN; V = 284.1 X 27.3 = 7756 kN.

The bearing stability requires the actual bearing pressure computed as q = 10X17.0 + 8.5X

Solution, Refer to Fig. E15-4 (drawn from final dimensions of Example 15-3). Note the sloping
line ef of Fig. 15-10c is broken here to account for two different ^-angles as line BCF. Do not use
the depth of fixity concept, as that was not a part of the Cummings method.

Step 1. Compute resistance of DCGE [use Eqs. (c) and (d)]:
c = CGtan 32° = (27.3 - 5.9) tan 32° = 13.4 m

15-9 CLOVERLEAF COFFERDAM DESIGN
Since the cloverleaf cell contains a large amount of piling and connections it is not much
used. Instead, the use of wells to dewater a circular cell to reduce the bursting pressure in
the interlocks (which usually control their design) is generally more economical. When it is
determined that a cloverleaf cell is required use the circular cell dimension that you will have
just computed (and found inadequate) as a starting point on the cloverleaf cell dimensions.
Make an approximate scaled drawing (both plan and elevation) to select dimensions (dis-
tances x, y, and radius r). Also draw the required pressure diagrams similar to Figs, \5-6a and
either b or c depending on whether the piling is to rock or into soil. These will not change;
however, the radius may.
You will always use one 90° double T for the cell center and four 120° Ys for the cell.
There will also be two, three, or four 30° Ys or 90° Ts for the connecting cells. It is usual to
use the dimensions of Fig. 15-lc—that is, L' = 3.2r.


The area of the cell (usually one-fourth is computed) is computed by dividing a quadrant
and the connecting arc into geometrical shapes whose areas can be directly obtained and then
summing the results. The equivalent width of a rectangular cell based on the total (including
connecting arc) cell area is
R- A - A

Once the equivalent width B is computed, the analysis proceeds as for a circular cell, and
being checked for the following:
1. Sliding stability
2. Overturning stability
3. Cell shear—when using Eq. (15-5)
V =VS + R11
Vs = P.tanS

where select terms are identified in Fig. 15-6 or have been previously used. Note the use of
8 instead of (f) for Vs since the shear resistance is on the interior cross walls.

PROBLEMS
15-1. What is the change in AH if the cell dimensions of Example 15-1 increase 10 percent (i.e.,
0.2 X L l = 0.22, 0.3 X L l = 0.33, etc.)?
15-2. What is AH if the cell dimensions of Example 15-1 decrease 10 percent (i.e., 0.2 X 0.9 = 0.18,
0.3 X 0.9 = 0.27, etc.)?
15-3. Redesign the diaphragm cofferdam of Example 15-2 if the cell depth of embedment D = 5.0
m (instead of 5.5) and the total height is H = 14 m. Assume the saturation line is at 7 m from
the top, and the freeboard distance remains at 0.6 m.
15-4. Redesign the diaphragm cofferdam of Example 15-2 if all of the soil (fill and base soil) has a

15-5. Redesign the cellular cofferdam of Example 15-3 if the saturation line is lowered to 1 m below
the dredge line by using wells.
15-6. Redesign the circular cofferdam of Example 15-3 if the total H = 20 m with the river flood
stage level = 20 m and the depth to the saturation line = 8 m (it is not 10 m). All other soil
data is the same.

soil (both cell and base).
15-9. Redo Example 15-3 using the given dimensions but using an inside berm as shown in Fig.
P15-9. Assume the berm resistance is R^ = Wb tan </>. Note that the berm provides a surcharge
for the lower passive resistance.

SINGLE PILES—STATIC CAPACITY
AND LATERAL LOADS;
PILE/POLE BUCKLING

16-1 INTRODUCTION
Piles are structural members of timber, concrete, and/or steel that are used to transmit surface
loads to lower levels in the soil mass. This transfer may be by vertical distribution of the load
along the pile shaft or a direct application of load to a lower stratum through the pile point.
A vertical distribution of the load is made using a friction (or floating) pile and a direct
load application is made by a point, or end-bearing, pile. This distinction is purely one of
convenience since all piles carry load as a combination of side resistance and point bearing
except when the pile penetrates an extremely soft soil to a solid base.
Piles are commonly used (refer to Fig. 16-1) for the following purposes:

1. To carry the superstructure loads into or through a soil stratum. Both vertical and lateral
loads may be involved.
2. To resist uplift, or overturning, forces, such as for basement mats below the water table or
to support tower legs subjected to overturning from lateral loads such as wind.
3. To compact loose, cohesionless deposits through a combination of pile volume displace-
ment and driving vibrations. These piles may be later pulled.
4. To control settlements when spread footings or a mat is on a marginal soil or is underlain
by a highly compressible stratum.
5. To stiffen the soil beneath machine foundations to control both amplitudes of vibration and
the natural frequency of the system.
6. As an additional safety factor beneath bridge abutments and/or piers, particularly if scour
is a potential problem.
7. In offshore construction to transmit loads above the water surface through the water and
into the underlying soil. This case is one in which partially embedded piling is subjected
to vertical (and buckling) as well as lateral loads.


Figure 16-1 Typical pile configurations. Note that, whereas analysis is often for a single pile, there are usually
three or more in a group. Typical assumptions for analysis are shown. Lateral load H may not be present in (a) or (b).

Piles are sometimes used to control earth movements (for example, landslides). The reader
should note that power poles and many outdoor sign poles may be considered as partially em-
bedded piles subject to lateral loads. Vertical loads may not be significant, although buckling
failure may require investigation for very tall members.
A pile foundation is much more expensive than spread footings and likely to be more
expensive than a mat. In any case great care should be exercised in determining the soil
properties at the site for the depth of possible interest so that one can as accurately as possible
determine whether a pile foundation is needed and, if so, that neither an excessive number
nor lengths are specified. A cost analysis should be made to determine whether a mat or piles,
in particular the type (steel, concrete, etc.), are more economical. In those cases where piles
are used to control settlement at marginal soil sites, care should be taken to utilize both the
existing ground and the piles in parallel so that a minimum number are required.
Piles are inserted into the soil via a number of methods:

1. Driving with a steady succession of blows on the top of the pile using a pile hammer. This
produces both considerable noise and local vibrations, which may be disallowed by local
codes or environmental agencies and, of course, may damage adjacent property.

(c) Offshore pile group.

(d) Tension pile. (e) Pile penetrating below a soil
layer that swells (shown) or
consolidates.

2. Driving using a vibratory device attached to the top of the pile. This method is usually rel-
atively quiet, and driving vibrations may not be excessive. The method is more applicable
in deposits with little cohesion.
3. Jacking the pile. This technique is more applicable for short stiff members.
4. Drilling a hole and either inserting a pile into it or, more commonly, filling the cavity
with concrete, which produces a pile upon hardening. A number of methods exist for this
technique, and the reader is referred to Table 16-1 and Fig. 16-7 for typical installations.

When a pile foundation is decided upon, it is necessary to compute the required pile cross
section and length based on the load from the superstructure, allowable stress in the pile
material (usually a code value), and the in situ soil properties. These requirements allow the
foundation contractor to order the necessary number and lengths of piles. Dynamic formulas,
pile-load tests, or a combination are used on-site to determine if the piles are adequately
designed and placed. It is generally accepted that a load test is the most reliable means of
determining the actual pile capacity.
Pile capacity determinations are very difficult. A large number of different equations are
used, and seldom will any two give the same computed capacity. Organizations that have
been using a particular equation tend to stick with it—particularly if a successful data base
has been established. It is for this reason that a number of what are believed to be the most
widely used (or currently accepted) equations are included in this text. In a design situa-
tion one might compute the pile capacity by several equations using the required empirical
factors suitably adjusted (or estimated) and observe the computed capacity. From a number
of these computations some "feel" for the probable capacity will develop so that a design
recommendation/proposal can be made.
Note that, although all the pile capacity equations are for a single pile, rarely is a single
pile used; rather two or three (or more) piles are used in a group. Further note that the soil
properties used in the design are those from the initial soil exploration program, and the soil
properties that exist when the foundation is in service may be very different depending on
how the piles have been installed and the number of piles in the group.
This chapter will be concerned with the methods of static pile capacity determination as
well as an introduction to materials and methods to produce pile members. Methods to analyze
lateral pile response to loads and to pile buckling will also be presented. Chapter 17 will take
up the problem of estimating pile capacity based on the field driving resistance (dynamic
capacity) and pile hammer energy.

16-2 TIMBERPILES
Timber piles are made of tree trunks with the branches carefully trimmed off, usually treated
with a preservative, and driven with the small end as a point. Occasionally the large end is
driven for special purposes as in very soft soil where the soil will flow back against the shaft
and with the butt resting on a firm stratum for increased bearing. The tip may be provided
with a metal driving shoe when the pile is to penetrate hard or gravelly soils; otherwise it
may be cut either square or with some point.
Generally there are limitations on the size of the tip and butt end as well as on the mis-
alignment that can be tolerated. The Chicago Building Code (in Chap. 13-132-190) requires
that the tip have a minimum diameter of 150 mm and the butt 250 mm if the pile is under

7.6 m and have a 300-mm butt if the pile is more than 7.6 m long. The alignment requirement
is that a straight line from the center of the butt to the center of the tip lie within the pile shaft
(Fig. \6-2a).
ASCE Manual 17 [reprinted ASCE (1959) but now out of print] categorizes timber piles
as follows:

Class A: To be used for heavy loads and/or large unsupported lengths. The minimum butt
diameter is 360 mm.
Class B: For medium loads. Minimum butt diameter is 300 mm.
Class C: Use below the permanent water table or for temporary works. Minimum butt
diameter is 300 mm. Bark may be left on this pile class.

The ASCE manual (and building codes) stipulate minimum quality of the timber concerning
defects, knots, holes, and type of wood.
If a timber pile is below the permanent water table, it apparently will last indefinitely.
When a timber pile is subjected to alternate wetting and drying, the useful life will be short,
perhaps as little as one year, unless treated with a wood preservative. Partly embedded piles
and piles above the water table are susceptible to damage from wood borers and other insects
unless treated.
The driving end of a timber pile is usually damaged by fiber crushing (called brooming)
from the hammer energy. This damage can be somewhat controlled by using a driving cap or
metal band around the butt as illustrated in Fig. 16-2. After having been driven to the neces-
sary penetration, the broomed end is cut square and any exposed scars, as well as the fresh end
cut, should be coated with a generous application of preservative. A pile may become bro-
ken where the soil is very hard or contains boulders. Where a sudden increase in penetration
occurs and a soft soil stratum is not expected, a broken pile shaft should be suspected.
Splices in timber piles are undesirable but may be effected as shown in Fig. 16-3. The
splice in Fig. 16-3& can transmit tension. In both illustrations care should be exercised to get
a maximum joint bearing area.

The allowable design load based on pile material is
Pa = Apfa (16-1)

where Ap = average pile cross-sectional area at the pile cap
fa = allowable design stress (code) value for the type of timber

The static capacity based on the soil surrounding the pile is computed as for other pile ma-
terials and will be taken up in Sec. 16-7 and following. The principal additional factor to
consider is that the coefficient of friction between wood and soil may approach tan </>' from
a combination of soil displacement from the wood volume and from penetration of the wood
by the soil grains— particularly in cohesionless soils.
Further information on timber piles may be obtained from American Wood Preservers
Institute (AWPI) publications (1966, 1967, 1969, 1981) and ASTM D 25 (Vol. 4.09).

16-3 CONCRETE PILES
Table 16-1 indicates that concrete piles may be precast, prestressed, cast in place, or of com-
posite construction.

Precast Concrete Piles
Piles in this category are formed in a central casting yard to the specified length, cured, and
then shipped to the construction site. If space is available and a sufficient quantity of piles
needed, a casting yard may be provided at the site to reduce transportation costs. Precast
piles may be made using ordinary reinforcement as in Fig. 16-4 or they may be prestressed
as in Fig. 16-5. Precast piles using ordinary reinforcement are designed to resist bending
stresses during pickup and transport to the site and bending moments from lateral loads and
to provide sufficient resistance to vertical loads and any tension forces developed during driv-
ing. The design procedures can be found in any text on reinforced-concrete design. However,

temporary stresses from handling and driving (tensile) may be used that are on the order of 50
percent larger than the allowable concrete design stresses. The minimum pile reinforcement
should be 1 percent.
Figure 16-6 illustrates typical bending moments developed during pickup depending on
the location of the pickup point. The pickup point should be clearly marked since the bending
moments depend heavily on its location.
Prestressed piles are formed by tensioning high-strength steel (/uit of 1700 to 1860 MPa)
prestress cables to a value on the order of 0.5 to 0.7/uit, and casting the concrete pile about
the cable. When the concrete hardens, the prestress cables are cut, with the tension force in
the cables now producing a compressive stress in the concrete pile as the steel attempts to
return to its unstretched length. The pile shortens under the prestress compression load P1-,
and additionally the concrete undergoes creep, while simultaneously there is some relaxation
in the steel, so the end result is an overall reduction of prestress force (and stress) that cannot
be precisely evaluated. One may attempt a refined analysis of this loss, but about the same
result is obtained by lumping the losses into a value of 240 MPa (i.e., <xpf = PjA - 240).

crpf further to produce a final compressive stress ay in the pile. These losses in the absence of
refined calculations may be taken as 240 MPa not including axial-shortening loss caused by
the applied design loads. Final compressive concrete stresses from prestressing are usually
on the order of 4 to 6 MPa. It is common to use higher-strength concrete (35 to 55 MPa) in
prestressed piles because of the large initial compressive stresses from prestressing. A modest
trade-off is obtained from the lighter-weight pile produced for the same load capacity.
The allowable design load Pa based on pile material for prestressed piles, and including
prestress loss due to load and creep, can be computed as
Pa = A,(0.33/c' - 0.27/pe) (16-2)
where Ag = gross (total) concrete area
/pe = effective prestress after all losses (about 5 MPa is usual)
Pickup points should be placed so that the computed bending stress has / = M/S < /pe,
where M is from Fig. 16-6. If this is done the pile should not develop tension cracks during
handling. Prestressing the pile tends to counteract any tension stresses during either handling
or driving. This latter is particularly important since a pile is often placed in a hostile en-
vironment. If tension stresses during driving are large enough transient tension cracks are
produced. During the time the crack is open foreign matter can enter and produce deteriora-
tion of the steel, which may not be detected for a long period of time.
Concrete piles are considered permanent; however, certain soils (usually organic) contain
materials that may form acids that can damage the concrete. Saltwater may also adversely
react with the concrete unless special precautions are taken when the mix proportions are
designed. Additionally, concrete piles used for marine structures may undergo abrasion from
wave action and floating debris in the water. Alternate freezing and thawing can cause con-
crete damage in any exposed situation.
Nonprestressed concrete used in marine structures should meet the following criteria:

1. Use nonreactive aggregates.
2. Use 8^ to 10 sacks of cement per cubic meter of concrete.

Cast-in-Place Piles
A cast-in-place pile is formed by drilling a hole in the ground and filling it with concrete. The
hole may be drilled (as in caissons), or formed by driving a shell or casing into the ground.
The casing may be driven using a mandrel, after which withdrawal of the mandrel empties
the casing. The casing may also be driven with a driving tip on the point, providing a shell
that is ready for filling with concrete immediately, or the casing may be driven open-end, the
soil entrapped in the casing being jetted1 out after the driving is completed.
Various methods with slightly different end results are available and patented. Figure 16-7
indicates some of the commonly available patented cast-in-place piles, and is intended to be
representative only. Note that they are basically of three types: (1) shell or cased, (2) shell-less
(uncased), or (3) pedestal types.

letting is a common construction procedure of using a high-velocity stream of water to erode (or wash) a volume
of soil into a soil-water suspension. The suspension is pumped or somehow disposed of so that an open cavity is
formed. Soil cavities can be jetted into nearly all soils, including those that are very dense and hard.

The allowable design load for all concrete piles (not prestressed) is
Pa = Acfc + A5fs (16-3)
where Ac, As = area of concrete and steel shell, respectively
fcf fs = allowable material stresses

Note that Eq. (16-3) does not apply for the aboveground portion of partially embedded
piles. A reduction factor may be applied (to either fc or Pa) for accidental eccentricities.
Slenderness effects (l/r ratio) for that portion of the shaft length surrounded by soil are not
necessary but may be required for the exposed length above ground.
A pile similar in section to that shown in Fig. 16-7« can be formed by using a hollow-
stem continuous-flight auger with a diameter of 250 to 400 mm. The hole is excavated to

the desired elevation, a hose is connected to the auger, and cement grout (a pumpable mix of
water, cement, and sand or sand and small gravel) is pumped under pressure down the auger
stem and out the tip into the cavity formed as the auger is slowly withdrawn. The soil on
the auger flights prevents the cement mixture from coming up the shaft and allows a modest
amount of pump pressure to be exerted to reduce voids and make a solid pile-to-soil contact
along the shaft.
A record should be kept of the auger depth and quantity of material pumped to ensure that
the hole is filled with grout and that the auger was not withdrawn too rapidly that soil caved
into the void such as to produce a discontinuous pile shaft. When the shaft has been filled,
the wet concrete, having a greater density than the surrounding soil, will maintain the shaft
until the concrete sets.
Reinforcement in the upper part of the shaft can be readily provided by inserting the proper
number of reinforcing bars (or dowels) into the wet concrete. Where several soil layers are
penetrated, the grout pressure may expand the borehole sufficiently to distort the pile shaft
slightly in the soft strata; however, the principal effect of this is to increase the quantity of
grout required to fill the shaft.
The Franki pile of Fig. 16-1 b and c is produced by first placing very dry (zero slump)
concrete in a cased shaft cavity and ramming it out of the casing base to produce an adequate-
sized base enlargement. The shaft cavity is then filled with concrete to complete the pile. The
casing may be pulled as the concrete is placed or left if pulling it would be difficult. Both the
Franki system (which is patented) and piles formed from the continuous-flight auger method
are very economical where cast-in-place procedures can be used.

16-4 STEEL PILES
These members are usually rolled HP shapes or pipe piles. Wide-flange beams or I beams
may also be used; however, the H shape is especially proportioned to withstand the hard
driving stress to which the pile may be subjected. In the HP pile the flanges and web are of
equal thickness; the standard W and I shapes usually have a thinner web than flange. Table
A-I in App. A lists the HP pile sections produced in the United States and Canada. Pipe piles
are either welded or seamless steel pipes, which may be driven either open-end or closed-end.
Closed-end pipe piles are usually filled with concrete after driving. Open-end piles may be
filled, but this is often not necessary, because there will be a dense soil plug at some depth
below the top (and visible). Here it may only be necessary to jet out some of the upper soil
plug to the necessary depth for any reinforcing bars required for bending (and to pump out the
water used for jetting), before filling the remainder of the pile cavity with concrete. Concrete
in only this shaft depth may be necessary for dowel bars.
The HP pile is a small-volume displacement pile since the cross-sectional area is not very
large. A plug tends to form between the flanges at greater depths, however, so the bottom
several meters may remold the soil on the order of the volume of the plug. An open-end pipe
is also considered a small-volume displacement pile; however, a plug also forms inside with
a depth one or more meters below the outside ground level—probably from a combination of
inside perimeter friction and driving vibrations. From the depth at which the "plug" stabilizes
(not visible during driving because of the pile cap and hammer interference) to the final
driving depth, the lower soil may be remolded based on the volume of the plug and not the
actual area of the pipe section.


Figure 16-8 Splices for H and pipe piles.

HP piles have an advantage of sufficient rigidity that they will either break smaller boul-
ders or displace them to one side. Open-end pipe piles have the advantage of surface entry
to break up boulders encountered by either use of a chopping bit or drilling, blasting, and
removal of the rock fragments. When large boulders are encountered one should consider the
possibility of terminating the pile on (or slightly into) them.
Splices in steel piles (see Fig. 16-8) are made in the same manner as in steel columns,
i.e., by welding (most common) or by bolting. Except for small projects involving only a
few piles, most splices are made with prefabricated (and patented) splice connectors. For HP
piles, splices can be prefabricated from two channels of adequate length back-to-back, with
a short spacer on which the top pile section rests. The splice is then welded to the web across
the ends, and the pile flanges are butt-welded to complete the splice. Pipe pile splicers consist
of a ledged ring with an ID slightly larger than the pipe OD. The two sections of pipe to be
joined rest against the inside ledge and an end weld is made around the pipe at both ends
of the splicer. Generally these splices will develop the strength of the pile in compression,
tension, bending, and shear to satisfy most building code requirements.
When a pile must be spliced to develop adequate embedment length, all the necessary
equipment should be standing by so that when the hammer is shut off the splice can be quickly
made. If this is not done—and sometimes if it is done—the soil tends to set or "freeze" about
the pile, and resumption of driving is difficult and sometimes requires changing to a larger
hammer. These larger driving stresses may cause considerable damage to the upper part of
the pile. This phenomenon is independent of pile material (such as timber, concrete, or steel).
If the top of the steel pile is adequately embedded in the cap (say 150 mm or more) special
load transfer plates are not necessary [Ohio (1947)]. Where embedment is limited or for
special purposes, steel plates can be welded on the top of the pile to assist in load transfer and
ensure that the piles and pile cap act as a unit.
In reference to Fig. 16-9c and Fig. 16-1Od, there is little difference in driving resistance
whether a pipe pile has a flat or conical driving point (or shoe). The reason is that a wedge-
shaped zone of soil develops in front of the flat point somewhat like zone abc of Fig. 4-3b
beneath a spread footing. It also appears that the later driving resistance of an open-end pipe
is about that of a closed-end pile since the plug of soil inside the pipe shell (with friction
developed with the wall) behaves similarly to the driving plate.

HP piles and pipe piles may require point reinforcement to penetrate hard soils or soils con-
taining boulders without excessive tip damage. Figure 16-9 illustrates field-/shop-fabricated
points, and Fig. 16-10 illustrates several that are commercially available. Those commer-
cially available are likely to be more economical due to associated labor and fabrication costs
except for isolated cases where only one or two might be needed.

16-5 CORROSION OF STEEL PILES
A corrosion study for the National Bureau of Standards [NBS (1962)] on both sheet-pile
and bearing-pile substructures indicated that if piles are driven in undisturbed natural soil
deposits, pile corrosion is not great enough to affect the strength of the piles significantly.
This study encompassed soils with pH (a pH less than 7 is acidic) values from 2.3 to 8.6,
and electric resistivities of 300 to 50 200 ohm • cm, from which it was further concluded that
as long as the soil was undisturbed, the soil characteristics and properties are not significant.
The substructures studied had been in service from 7 to 40 years. The soil resistance probe
described by Roy and Ramaswamy (1983) may be used to obtain the soil resistance (ohm-cm)
for estimating the probability of pile corrosion in the given site soil.
This study also indicated that piles driven in disturbed, or fill, soils will tend to undergo
relatively more corrosion and may require painting (i.e., paint the pile, then construct the
backfill). This observation was attributed to a higher oxygen concentration in the disturbed
soil. Undisturbed soils were found to be oxygen-deficient from a few feet below the ground
surface.
Piles exposed to seawater or to effluents with a pH much above 9.5 or below 4.0 will require
painting or encasement in concrete to resist corrosion [Watkins (1969)]. This statement also
applies to piles in general for the several feet in the zone where the water line fluctuates. As
an alternative to painting or concrete encasement, a splice that uses a slightly larger section
in the corrosive zone may be made.
Some of the newer grades of high-strength and copper-alloy steels are said to have sub-
stantial corrosion resistance. The A690 high-strength low-alloy steel has approximately two
to three times more corrosion resistance to seawater than ordinary carbon steel of A36 grade.
High-strength steel HP piles are seldom needed since the geotechnical considerations (bear-
ing capacity of the rock or soil resistance) are more likely to set the structural stresses required
of the steel than the structural considerations as set by codes, which may allow fa = 0.33 to
0.5Fy. For example, if the maximum allowable rock pressure for a pile founded on rock is 70
MPa, that sets a limit in the HP pile of 70 MPa regardless of Fy.

16-6 SOIL PROPERTIES FOR STATIC PILE CAPACITY
For static pile (and group) capacity analysis the angle of internal friction </> and the cohesion
c of the soil are needed. Immediate controversy arises since some designers use undrained
(or total) stress parameters, whereas others—particularly more recently—use effective stress
values.
For wave equation analysis a value for the elastic recovery from deformation (quake, Q)
and damping constants are needed.
Lateral pile analyses require use of the lateral modulus of subgrade reaction ks or a lateral
stress-strain modulus Es. The context of usage determines whether the lateral or horizontal
value is of interest for these latter two parameters.


The soil parameters may be determined from laboratory triaxial tests on "undisturbed"
samples. These are quite satisfactory for piles installed in predrilled holes but may be con-
siderably in error for driven piles.
Laboratory triaxial test parameters are not very reliable for driven piles since the soil in the
vicinity of the pile undergoes extensive remolding, a change in water content, and usually an
increase in density (or particle packing). Since these changes are highly indeterminate there
is no way to duplicate them in any current laboratory test with any confidence. Thus, if labo-
ratory tests are used, they are on the original in situ "undisturbed" samples, with experience
used to extrapolate these data to obtain the design parameters. For these reasons the SPT is
widely used, although there is movement to more use of CPT or PMT (the vane test is not
much used) to obtain in situ parameters.
Most pile design in cohesionless materials (sands, gravelly sands, silty sands, etc.) is based
on SPT N values. Pile design in cohesive deposits is usually based on unconfined compres-
sion strength qu tests (pocket penetrometer, compression tests, the laboratory vane, hand-held
pocket-sized shear strength test device called a torvane), primarily on very disturbed samples
from the SPT. The CPT is, however, being used more in cohesive deposits (and in fine sands
and fine silty sands) since those experienced with the procedure believe better design data
are obtained.
The SPT N values should be adjusted to a standard energy—either N70 or N55 depending
on the available data base and using the procedures outlined in Sees. 3-7 through 3-9.
Piles driven into the soil mass always result in remolding of the soil in the immediate
vicinity of the pile (say, three to five pile diameters). At this instant, undrained soil-strength
parameters are produced, which may approach remolded drained values if the degree of sat-
uration S is low and/or the coefficient of permeability k is relatively large.
In general, however, a considerable time lapse (several months to years) occurs before the
full design loads are applied. In this interval the excess pore pressures dissipate, and drained
(or consolidated-undrained if below the GWT) conditions exist. For these it appears remolded
(or residual) soil parameters best describe the soil behavior.
The capacity of piles in soft clays increases with time, with most strength regain occurring
in from 1 to 3 months [Flaate and Seines (1977), Orrje and Broms (1967)], HP piles requiring
longer times. This increase in capacity is somewhat explained from the pile volume displace-
ment producing high pore pressures that cause a more rapid drainage and consolidation of the
soil very near the pile.
There is some opinion that the displaced volume of pipe and similar piles produces so much
lateral compression in cohesive soils that a zone of perhaps 50 to 200 mm tends to consolidate
to such a high value that the effective pile diameter is increased 5 to 7 percent over the actual
value. This increase in "effective" diameter produces a corresponding increase in pile load
capacity.
The reduced water content resulting from consolidation in this zone has been observed for
some time [see references cited in Flaate (1972)]. The increase in "effective" pile diameter
is likely to be marginal (or nonexistent) in very stiff and/or overconsolidated clays. In fact
the volume displacement in these clays may produce a reduction in capacity over time as soil
creep reduces the lateral pressure produced by the initial volume displacement.
Tavenas and Audy (1972) report an increase in load capacity with time for piles in sand,
with the principal regain occurring in about the first month. This strength increase cannot
be attributed to dissipation of excess pore pressures but may be due to aging from chemi-
cal contaminants (primarily carbonates) causing inter-grain and grain-to-pile adhesion. There


may be some gain in capacity from dissipation of residual driving stresses; however, this is
doubtful since modern methods of driving produce a viscous semi-fluid state in a zone of 6
to 8 mm (at least) around the pile.
The pile capacity in calcareous sands may be considerably less after installation than the
design value indicated by conventional design. This material (particularly if the carbonate
content is greater than 50 percent) deteriorates rapidly under stress in the presence of water.
Since the carbonate content is a byproduct of biological deposition (shells and such), deteri-
oration is more likely to occur along shorelines and coral islands. Unfortunately except for
performing tests (ASTM D 4373) for carbonate content (in percent) there is not much that
can be done to quantify a design. Murff (1987, with a number of references) noted that some
designers simply limit the skin resistance fs (see Sec. 16.7) to some value on the order 15 to
30 kPa and point bearing qo in the range of 4000 to 6000 kPa with smaller design values as
the percent carbonates increases.
The pile literature contains a great number of conflicting conclusions obtained from both
correct and incorrect interpretations of measured load test results and naturally occurring soil
anomalies. As a consequence statistical correlations are particularly useful, but only on reli-
able data. Much of the pile literature (particularly early publications) did not provide enough
data so that the reader could arrive at any kind of conclusion. Including these early data in
a statistical correlation is not recommended although most publishers of correlations feel the
more cases cited the better (or the more confidence the reader will have in the results).
Where piles are placed in predrilled holes, the soil state remains at nearly the existing
(drained or consolidated undrained) condition. Possible deterioration of the cohesion at the
interface of the wet concrete and soil may occur but this will be partially offset by the small
increase in pile diameter when grains in the surrounding soil become part of the pile shaft as
the cement hydrates.
The loss of K0 from soil expansion into the cavity may be partially offset by the lateral
pressure developed from the wet concrete, which has a higher density than the soil.
Summarizing, for pile design we do not have a very good means to obtain soil parameters
except for predrilled piles. For all cases of driven piles we have to estimate the soil parameters.
In most cases if there is reasonable correlation between the design and measured load (from
a load test) it is a happy coincidence.

16-7 STATIC PILE CAPACITY
All static pile capacities can be computed by the following equations:
Pu = Ppu+^Psi ]
> (compression) (\6-5a)
= Pp + 2_,Psi,u J
T u = ^1PsUu + Wp (tension) (16-5Z?)

where Pu = ultimate (maximum) pile capacity in compression—usually defined as
that load producing a large penetration rate in a load test
T11 = ultimate pullout capacity
Ppu = ultimate pile tip capacity—seldom occurs simultaneously with ultimate
skin resistance capacity X Psi,u\ neglect for "floating" piles (which de-
pends only on skin resistance)


Pp = tip capacity that develops simultaneously with X Psi,u\ neglect for "float-
ing" piles
2 Psi = skin resistance developing with ultimate tip resistance Ppu; neglect for
point bearing piles
S Psi,u = ultimate skin resistance developing simultaneously with some tip capac-
ity Pp
W = weight of pile being pulled
2 = summation process over / soil layers making up the soil profile over length
of pile shaft embedment

The allowable pile capacity Pa or Ta is obtained from applying a suitable SF on the con-
tributing parts as
p - ^EL + ^Psi (a\

 {a)

or using a single value SF (most common practice) to obtain

This value of Pa or Ta should be compatible with the capacity based on the pile material
(timber, concrete, or steel) considered earlier; and SF/ represents the safety factors, which
commonly range from 2.0 to 4 or more, depending on designer uncertainties.
Opinion is mixed whether SF, should be based on both load-carrying mechanisms [Eq.
(a)] or be a single value [Eq. (b)]. In general, safety factors for piles are larger than for spread
foundations because of more uncertainties in pile-soil interaction and because of the greater
expense of pile foundations.
Although Eqs. (16-5) are certainly not highly complex in form, using them to arrive at a
prediction of capacity that closely compares with a load test is often a fortunate event. A lack
of correspondence is attributable to the difficulties in determining the in situ soil properties,
which (as previously stated) change in the vicinity of the pile after it is has been installed.
Additionally, the soil variability, both laterally and vertically, coupled with a complex pile-
soil interaction, creates a formidable problem for successful analysis.
We can readily see from Eq. (16-5«) that the ultimate pile capacity Pu is not the sum of the
ultimate skin resistance plus the ultimate point resistance but is the sum of one and a portion
of the other.
Ultimate skin resistance is produced at some small value of relative slip between pile and
soil, where slip is defined at any point along the pile shaft as the accumulated differences in
shaft strain from axial load and the soil strain caused by the load transferred to it via skin
resistance. This slip progresses down the pile shaft with increasing load.
In the upper regions the slip reaches limiting skin resistance and load is transferred to
lower regions, which reach limiting skin resistance,..., etc., and finally to the tip, which
begins to carry load. If pile penetration is rapid at this time the ultimate load Pu is reached. If
penetration is not rapid the point load increases with further penetration until it also reaches
ultimate, but with further penetration the slip resistance reduces to some limiting value that
is less than the ultimate. We are now at the maximum pile capacity Pu.


The essential difference for tension capacity is that there is no point load, so that the force
necessary to initiate a constant withdrawal rate is some limiting skin resistance, plus the
pile weight Wp, plus suction at and near the point in wet soils. Suction, however, is seldom
considered in design since it is transient. Again the upper pile elements reach the limiting
skin resistance first.
Although it is common to compute the skin resistance contribution as an "average" value
over one or two depth increments, better correlation is obtained if the summation is made
for each stratum penetrated, using the best estimate of the applicable soil parameters for
that stratum. The normal increase in soil density with depth will always produce several
"soil layers" having values of y, 0, and c that are somewhat different from those obtained
using a single layer even for the same soil. It has been popular (and also convenient but not
recommended) to use an average value from the several layers making up the site soil profile.
A computer program (such as PILCAPAC) makes it a trivial exercise to subdivide the soil
penetrated by the pile shaft into several layers for an improved analysis.
A study of load-settlement and load-transfer curves from a number of load tests indicates
that slip to develop maximum skin resistance is on the order of 5 to 10 mm [Whitaker and
Cooke (1966), Coyle and Reese (1966), AISI (1975)] and is relatively independent of shaft
diameter and embedment length, but may depend upon the soil parameters cf) and c. Note that
sufficient slip at any point along the shaft to mobilize the limiting shear resistance is not the
same as the butt movement measured in a pile-load test (as illustrated in Fig. 17-6) but is
larger than the slip that produces the maximum (or ultimate) skin resistance.
Mobilization of the ultimate point resistance in any soil requires a point displacement on
the order of 10 percent of the tip diameter B (see Fig. 16-lla for point cross section) for
driven piles and up to 30 percent of the base diameter for bored piles and caissons. This is a
total point displacement and when the pile point is in material other than rock may include
additional point displacement caused by skin resistance stresses transferred through the soil
to produce settlement of the soil beneath the point (refer to qualitative stress trajectories on
right side of Fig. 16-1 Ia). It is highly probable that in the usual range of working loads, skin
resistance is the principal load-carrying mechanism in all but the softest of soils.
Since the pile unloads to the surrounding soil via skin resistance, the pile load will de-
crease from the top to the point. The elastic shortening (and relative slip) will be larger in the
upper shaft length from the larger axial load being carried. Examination of a large number of
load-transfer curves reported in the literature shows that the load transfer is approximately
parabolic and decreases with depth for cohesive soils as shown in Fig. 16-12a.
The load transfer may, however, be nearly linear for cohesionless soils, and the shape may
be somewhat dependent on embedment depth in all materials. Generally a short pile will
display a more nearly linear load-transfer curve than a long pile; however, this conclusion
is somewhat speculative since not many very long piles have been instrumented because of
both expense and the poor survivability of instrumentation with increased driving effort. The
more nonlinear load-transfer curves for long piles may be caused from overburden pressure
increasing the soil stiffness with depth. The load-transfer curves for either short end-bearing
or long friction piles may be nearly linear and vertical at the butt end where the relative slip
and driving whip, or lateral shaft movement under hammer impacts (critical in stiff clays)
are so large that the upper soil carries very little load. Figure 16-13 illustrates a case where
the upper region also carries very little load at higher pile loads; however, this is in sand fill
so that the small load is due more to relative slip than to driving whip damage.

Figure 16-13 Load transfer for long HP piles in sand. Note that the behavior of H 14 X 117 is considerably
different from that of the H 14 X 89 at higher loads. [After D'AppoIonia (1968).]

The amount of load that is carried by the point under any butt loading depends on the sur-
rounding soil, length and stiffness (AE/L) of the pile, and the actual load. Load duration and
elapsed time before load application may also be significant factors to increase (or decrease)
the point load for end-bearing piles that penetrate soft soils as shown in Fig. 16-12&.
Inspection of Figs. 16-12 and 16-13 indicates some interpretation is required to estimate
load transfer at any depth increment. The piles of Fig. 16-13 are in the same site, but at higher
loads there is little similarity in the shapes of the load-transfer curves.
When a pile is driven into a soil the response will depend upon several factors:

1. The volume of soil displaced by the pile. Concrete, closed-end pipe, and timber piles
displace a large volume of soil relative to open-end pipe and HP piles.
A plug forms on the inside of an open-end driven pipe pile and acts as a part of the pile
cross section (including an apparent weight increase) when the friction resistance on the
metal perimeter becomes larger than the weight of the plug [see Paikowsky and Whitman
(1990)]. The plug is visible at some depth below the ground line in driven pipe piles. This
depth represents a volume change due to driving vibrations and compression from friction
between the inside pipe perimeter and the soil plug [see Eq. (17-8)].
Two plugs (or partial plugs) usually form between the flanges of HP piles depending
on the amount of soil-to-steel friction/adhesion along the inner faces of the two flanges

and web and on the amount of soil-to-soil friction/adhesion across the web depth. In clay
the "plugged" case of Fig. 16-1 Ic will generally form unless the pile is quite short. In
sands the full plug may not form [see CoyIe and Ungaro (1991)]. You can estimate the
amount of plug formation (refer to Fig. 16-1 Ic) as follows:
(2xp + dw)yzK tan S = dwyzKtan<fi
Canceling yzK, using dw = d, and solving for xp, we obtain

Xp = 2 (tanS ~ l< ~2 (Pa r t i a l Pl u S f o r m s)
bf
> -y- (full plug forms)
Then Apoint = d X 2xp (neglecting web thickness)
Perimeter A^ = 2b/ + 2d (neglect any inner flange width zones)
The preceding roundings should give adequate computational accuracy since the xp
zone is likely curved inward from the inner flange tips and not the assumed straight line
shown. You can refine the foregoing for actual web thickness if desired, but both angles (f>
and S are usually estimated. You probably should make this check even for point bearing
piles in dense sand.
Use these "plug" dimensions to compute the plug weight to add to any pile computa-
tions that include a pile weight term Wp.
2. The amount and type of overburden material. Piles penetrating a cohesionless soil into clay
will tend to drag sand grains into the cohesive soil to a depth of about 20 pile diameters
[Tomlinson (1971)]. This material will be trapped in the void around the perimeter caused
by driving whip and tends to increase the skin resistance.
3. The fact that piles penetrating a soft clay layer into a stiffer lower layer will drag (or flow)
a film of the softer material into the perimeter void to a depth of about 20 pile diameters.
This dragdown may not be serious, however, for the crack closure will consolidate this
material so that the resulting adhesion will be much higher than the adhesion in the upper
soft layer.
4. The fact that large-volume piles penetrating a stiff clay layer tend to form large surface
cracks that radiate out from the pile such that adhesion in the topmost 20 pile diameters
is most uncertain. Generally the top 1.2 to 1.8 m of penetration should be neglected in
computing the skin resistance in medium stiff or stiff clays and in sand.
5. The fact that soft clay tends to flow and fill any cracks that form during driving. After
driving and dissipation of the excess pore pressures, the skin resistance tends to be larger
than the initial values. It is believed that considerable consolidation occurs, which pro-
duces the higher skin resistances. This is the rationale that the adhesion factor a [of such
as Eq. (16-11)] can be larger than 1 when su is under about 50 kPa.

16-8 ULTIMATE STATIC PILE POINT CAPACITY
The ultimate static pile point capacity in any soil can be computed using the bearing-capacity
equations given in Table 4-1. The Ny term is often neglected when the pile base width Bp is
not large. It may not be neglected where an enlarged pile base or the piers of Chap. 19 are


used. The computed point bearing capacity varies widely because there is little agreement on
what numerical values to use for the bearing-capacity factors Ni.
We will look at several of the more popular values, but no special recommendation is given
for the "best" values since local practice or individual designer preference usually governs
the values selected/used.
As previously stated, the soil parameters may be derived from laboratory tests on "undis-
turbed" samples but more often are unconfined compression data from an SPT or cone pen-
etration test data. In general, the point capacity is computed as

Ppu = Ap(cN'cdcsc + r)Wqdqsq + ±y'BpNysy) (16-6)

where Ap = area of pile point effective in bearing, i.e., generally include any "plug." Use
actual steel area for point bearing HP piles founded on rock, giving simply
^pu = ^steei X tfuit; see Sec. 4-16 for rock quh
c = cohesion of soil beneath pile point (or su)
Bp = width of pile point (including "plug")—usually used only when point is en-
larged
N'c = bearing capacity factor for cohesion as previously defined in Chap. 4 but not
computed the same way. Use
dc = 1 +0AtaaTl(L/B)
And when <f> = 0; c = su\ N'c « 9.0
N'q = bearing capacity factor (may include overburden effects)
Use dq = 1 + 2 tan 0(1 - sin ^ ) 2 tan"1 L/B
The following depth factors are representative:

LIB dc dq; <f> = 36°
10 1.59 1.36 = 1 +0.247 tan"1 10
20 1.61 1.38
40 1.62 1.38
100 1.62 1.39

Ny = bearing capacity factor for base width = N7 since it is not affected by depth
q z= yL = effective vertical (or overburden) pressure at pile point
7] = 1.0 for all except the Vesic (1975#) Ni factors where

I+2K0

K0 = at-rest earth pressure coefficient defined in Chap. 2.


When making point resistance computations, keep in mind that these bearing-capacity
factors are based on the initial in situ soil parameters and not on any soil parameters revised
to include driving effects. Initially, of course, any revised values would not be known.
Neglecting the N7 term and making adjustment for pile weight, we may rewrite Eq. (16-6)
as follows:
PPu = Ap[cN'cdc + Vq(N'q - l)dq] (16-6a)
For c = su and (/> = 0, the value of Nq = 1 and
Pp11 = Ap(9su) (16-66)
Most designers use Nq, not (N'q - 1), for piles (but not piers of Chap. 19) when <f> > 0 since
the factor reduced by 1 is a substantial refinement not justified by estimated soil parameters.
The ultimate point capacity is divided by an SF on the order of 1.5 to 3.
Based on results obtained by Coyle and Castello (1981), who back-computed point capac-
ities of a large number of piles in sand, the Hansen bearing-capacity factors of Table 4-4 can
be used together with the shape and depth factors of Table 4-5 with a reliability about as good
as any other procedure.
The Terzaghi bearing-capacity equation and factors (Table 4-3) are often used even though
they are strictly valid only for L< B. They seem to give about the same point capacity as the
Hansen equation for pile depths on the order of 10 to 20 m—probably because the Hansen
Nqdq term equates to the larger Terzaghi Nq factor.
The depth factor dc was previously shown to give a limiting value on the order of 1.62;
the depth factor dq depends on both the pile depth ratio L/B and 4> but from the typical values
previously given we see that it can be computed to give a limit on the Nq term as well. From
this we see that using any of Eqs. (16-6) gives an unlimited ultimate point resistance Pu but at
a decreasing rate. The point capacity increase at a decreasing rate with increasing L/B seems
to be approximately what occurs with actual piles, and for this reason critical depth methods
such as that of Meyerhof (1976), which adjusts both bearing-capacity factors N'c, Nq using a
critical depth ratio of LjB that was dependent on the (/> angle of the soil, are not suggested
for use.

The Vesic Method
According to Vesic (1975a) the bearing-capacity factors N't of Eq. (16-6) can be computed
based on the following:

"'- - r 4 ? M d " *)r*\^if + !)&*} (1(-7)
The reduced rigidity index /rr in this equation is computed using the volumetric strain ev
[see Eq. (d) of Sec. 2-14] as
/ - Ir (c\
1 + evlr
The rigidity index Ir is computed using the shear modulus G' and soil cohesion and shear
strength s (or T) as


Ir = - M = - id)
c H- q tan <p s
When undrained soil conditions exist or the soil is in a dense state, take ev = 0.0 so that/rr =
/r. The value of/rr depends on the soil state (loose, dense; low, medium, or high plasticity)
and on the mean normal stress defined by r(q with lower Ir values in sand when rfq is low.
In clay higher Ir values are used when the water content is high and/or together with a high
r)~q. The lowest values of Ir ~ 10 are obtained (or used) for a clay with high OCR and low
jjq. Estimates for Ir may be made as follows:

SOU Ir
Sand (Dr = 0.5-0.8) 75-150
Silt 50-75
Clay 150-250

Use lower lr values with higher average effective mean normal stress rjq.
Since the Vesic method is based on cavity expansion theory, the pile tip behavior is similar
to that of the CPT. On this basis Baldi et al. (1981) suggest the following equations for /r:
For Dutch cone tip (see Fig. 3-14a):
r 3 0 °
Ir = -T- (e)
JR
For the electric cone (see Fig. 3-15a):

JR
where //? = friction ratio in percent given by Eq. (3-10).

The Vesic bearing-capacity factor N'c term can be computed by one of the following equations:
A^ = (A^- l)cot(/> (16-7a)
When (f) = 0 (undrained conditions)
A^ = l ( l n / r r + l ) + ! + l (16-76)

Janbu's Values
Janbu (1976) computes N'q (with angle \fj in radians) as follows:
N'q = (tan 0 H- Vl + tan2 </>) exp(2^ tan </>) (16-7c)
For either the Vesic or Janbu methods obtain N'c from Eq. (16-7a) for 0 > 0, from Eq. (16-
Ib) when 0 = 0. The value of ifj for the Janbu equation is identified in Fig. 16-116 and may
vary from 60° in soft compressible to 105° in dense soils. Table 16-2 gives a selected range
of N- values, which can be used for design or in checking the Vesic and Janbu equations.

The American Petroleum Institute [API (1984)] has formulated recommendations for pile
design in the form of design parameters for piles in sands, silts, sand silts, and gravels based
on a soil description ranging from very loose to very dense. This publication suggests using
Nq ranging from a low of 8 for very loose sand to 50 for a dense gravel or very dense sand.
The table is footnoted that the values are intended as guidelines only. These values seem
rather low compared to recommendations by most authorities, particularly when considering
that piles driven into loose sand will densify it a modest amount in almost all circumstances.
A study of a number of pile load tests by Endley et al. (1979) indicated the 1979 API
[reissued as API (1984)] recommendations for Nq were about 50 percent too low. Be aware
that recommended values are not requirements; however, if they are not followed, one must
be prepared to justify the use of any alternative values.

Using Penetration Test Data for Pile Point Resistance
For standard penetration test (SPT) data Meyerhof (1956, 1976) proposed
PVu = Ap(AON)1^ < AP(38(W) (kN) (16-8)

where Af = statistical average of the SPT N^ numbers in a zone of about SB above
to 3B below the pile point (see Fig. 16-1IZ?). Use any applicable SPT N
corrections given in Chap. 3.


B = width or diameter of pile point
Lt = pile penetration depth into point-bearing stratum
Lb/B = average depth ratio of point into point-bearing stratum

According to Shioi and Fukui (1982) pile tip resistance is computed in Japan as
^pu = quitAp (16-9)
with the ultimate tip bearing pressure qu\t computed from the SPT based on the embedment
depth ratio Lb/D into the point-bearing stratum as follows:

Driven piles guit/V = 6Lb/D < 30 (open-end pipe piles)
quit/N = 10 H- ALjD < 30 (closed-end pipe)
Cast-in-place qu\t = 300 (in sand)
tfuit = 3su (in clay)
Bored piles qu\t = ION (in sand)
<7uit = 15 N (in gravelly sand)

where this SPT N should be taken as N55.
For cone penetration data with L/B > 10 the point load is estimated by the Japanese as
^pu = Apqc (in units of qc) (16-9«)
where qc = statistical average of the cone point resistance in a zone similar to that for N55
ofEq. (16-8).

Summarizing Pile Point Capacity
We can compute the ultimate pile point capacity by using Eqs. (16-6), (16-8), or
(16-9), depending on the data available. The major problem in using Eq. (16-6) is hav-
ing access to a reliable angle of internal friction <fi and soil unit weight y. We have at least
three methods of obtaining the N factors: Table 4-1, Vesic, or Janbu. We should note that
Fig. 2-31 indicates that (f> is pressure-dependent, so laboratory values in the common range
of triaxial cell test pressures of 70 to 150 kPa may be several degrees larger than field values
at the pile point, which may be 20 or 30 meters down where there is a substantially larger
effective normal stress.
In Table 4-4, Nq more than doubles going from </> = 34° to 40°; thus, even small variations
of 1 or 2° can produce a significant change in the pile point capacity.
The following example will illustrate how some of the methods given here are used.

Example 16-1. The point of a pile of L = 25 m is founded into a dense medium-coarse sand
deposit, which has an average N-JQ = 30 in the zone of influence of about 1.5 m above the tip to 3
m below. The pile is an HP 360 X 174 with d X b = 361 X 378 mm. The GWT is 5 m below the
ground surface.

Required. Estimate the point capacity Pu using the several methods presented in this section.


Solution.

Ap = d Xb (including the plug between flanges) = 0.361 X 0.378 = 0.136 m2
W55 = ^70(70/55) = 30(70/55) = 38
With a 1.5 m embedment into dense bearing sand, L\, = 1.5 m. We estimate the overburden unit
weight ys = 16.5 kN/m3 since we have no N values or other data.
By Meyerhof's Eq. (16-8). From this we directly obtain
^pu = Ap(40 X N55)LjB = 0.136(40 X 38)( 1.5/0.361) = 859 kN
The maximum recommended limit for the preceding equation is
/>pu = Ap400N55 = 0.136(380 X 38) = 1964 > 859 -> use 859 kN
We will also use the other equations for a comparison.
By Hansen's Eq. (16-6)
Ppu = Ap(cNcdc + ifqNqdq + hy'BpNy)
For sand the cNc term is 0. We can estimate for the medium coarse sand with NJO = 30 a value of
cf) ~ 36° (range from 36 to 50°) from Table 3-4 and in the tip zone ysand = 17.0 kN/m3. From Table
4-4 we obtain Nq = 37.7; N7 = 40.0; depth factor = 0.247. We then compute
dq = 1 + 0.247 tan" \L/B) = 1 + 0.247 tan"1 (25/0.361) = 1.38
q = 5 X 16.5 + 18.5(16.5 - 9.807) + 1.5(17.0 - 9.807)
= 217.1 kPa (16.5 kN/m3 above tip zone and 17.0 kN/m3 in tip zone)
Ppu = 0.136 [217.1 X 37.7 X 1.38 + 1(17.0 - 9.807)(0.361 X 40)]
= 0.136(11 295 + 52) = 1543.2 kN
By Vesic's Method for N'q, N'y. Estimate K0 = 1 - sin 36° = 0.412:
1 4 - 9 x 0 4 1 ?
T? = - — = 0.61 -> Tjg = 0.61 x 217.1 = 132.4 kPa
Based on using /rr = 100, Eq. (16-7), and program FFACTOR (option 10), we obtain
Nq = 93.2 (N'c is not needed)
Ny = 40 from Hansen equation (and Table 4-4)
dq = 1.38, as before
Substituting values into Eq. (16-6), we obtain
Ppu = 0.136(132.4 X 93.2 X 1.38 + { X 7.2 X 0.361 X 40)
= 0.136(17028.8 + 52.0) = 2323 kN
By Janbu's method [Eq. (16-6) but using N'q from Eq. (16-7<f)]. Using program FFACTOR (option
10), for <t> = 36° and estimating \\J « 90°, we obtain N; = 37A\dq = 1.38 as before; q = 217A
kPa (as before)
A^ = 40.0 as in Hansen equation also
Substituting values into Eq. (16-6), we obtain


By Terzaghi's method [Ppu = 0.136GzN9 + \y'NysY)], equation from Table 4-1. Using Nq =
47.2; N7 = 51.7; sy = 0.8; L = 25 m; B = 0.361 m; Ap = 0.136 m2; q = 217.1 kPa; y' =
17.0 - 9.807 = 7.2, we obtain
Ppu = 0.136(217.1 X 47.2 + ± X 7.2 X 0.361 X 51.7 x 0.8)
= 0.136(10300.87) = 140IkN
A good question is what to use for Ppu. We could, of course, average these values, but there are
too many computations involved here for a designer to compute a number of point resistances and
obtain their average.
Let us instead look at a tabulation of values and see if any worthwhile conclusions can be drawn:

Method Ppu, kN

Hansen 1543.2
Terzaghi 1401.0
Janbu 1531.0
Meyerhof 859.0
Vesic 2323.0

From this tabulation it is evident that the Meyerhof value is too conservative; the Vesic may be too
large; but almost any value can be obtained by suitable manipulation of /rr and, similarly with the
Janbu equation, with manipulation of the ip angle.
From these observations it appears that the Hansen equation from Chap. 4 using values from
Table 4-4 provides as good an estimate of point capacity as the data usually available can justify.
As a consequence that is the only method used in the rest of this text and is included as one of the
point capacity contribution methods in the computer program PILCAPAC noted on your diskette
and described further in the next section concerning skin resistance.

16-9 PILE SKIN RESISTANCE CAPACITY
The skin resistance part of Eq. (16-5) is currently computed using either a combination of
total and effective, or only effective, stresses. Some evidence exists that use of only effective
stresses gives a better correlation of prediction to load tests; however, both methods are widely
used. Preference will depend on the data base of successful usage in a given locale/design
office.
Three of the more commonly used procedures for computing the skin resistance of piles in
cohesive soils will be given here. These will be called the a, A, and /3 methods for the factors
used in the skin resistance capacity part of Eq. (16-5). The /3 method is also used for piles in
cohesionless soils. In all cases the skin resistance capacity is computed as
n
^ Asfs (in units of/,) (16-10)
i
where As = effective pile surface area on which fs acts; computed as perimeter X embed-
ment increment AL. Refer to Fig. 16-1 Ia for pile perimeters.
AL = increment of embedment length (to allow for soil stratification and variable
pile shaft perimeters in the embedment length L)
fs = skin resistance to be computed, using one of the three methods previously cited

17.0 - 9.807 = 7.2, we obtain
Ppu = 0.136(217.1 X 47.2 + ± X 7.2 X 0.361 X 51.7 x 0.8)
= 0.136(10300.87) = 140IkN
A good question is what to use for Ppu. We could, of course, average these values, but there are

obtain their average.

AL = increment of embedment length (to allow for soil stratification and variable
pile shaft perimeters in the embedment length L)

The reader should note that the following equations for fs are in general terms so that success-
ful use will depend on how accurately the summation process is made and the soil parameters
are identified.

16-9.1 The a Method
A general method for pile shaft skin resistance that was initially proposed by Tomlinson
(1971) is
fs = ac + qK tan 8 (units of c, q) (16-11)
which includes both adhesion ac and friction. Equation (16-11) is not much used in this
general form but rather simply as
fs = ac or asu (16-lla)

where a = coefficient from Fig. 16-14
c = average cohesion (or su) for the soil stratum of interest
q = effective average (or midheight) vertical stress yszi on element AL (Fig. 16-
Ua)
K = coefficient of lateral earth pressure ranging from K0 to about 1.75, depend-
ing on volume displacement, initial soil density, etc. The author has found the
following to work rather well:
„ _ Ka + FWKO + Kp
K 2TF;;^
where the Kt values are as previously defined and Fw = weighting factor for
K0 ranging from 1.0 upward
S = effective friction angle between soil and pile material (use either values from
Table 11-6 or 4>' = effective value); use S = O when <f> = 0°

Compute K0 using Eq. (2-18(3) and adjust for OCR using Eq. (2-23).

The API (1984) also suggests using the a method with factors as shown on Fig. 16-14 for
normally consolidated clay. API recommends not more than 50 kPa for OCR > 1 or large
L/B ratios.
Sladen (1992) derived an equation to compute a directly based on the undrained shear
strength su and the effective overburden stress ~q. It can be derived using the following:

fs = asu = qhtan8 and qh = KKo,ncq

Ko>oc = \ = Ko,nc X OCR" [see Eq. (2-23)]
q
Also su = Aq(OCR)m and m « 1 - Cs/Cc
where C5, Cc = compression indexes from Chap. 2
A = sjp'o (normally consolidated values) from Fig. 2-36
Ac > 1 = for driven piles K < 1 for bored piles

Making substitutions for fs, q^ and su and solving for a, we obtain

a = — r — -r- t a n ^ (16-12)
A \Aq)
Ifone assumes these values: Ci = KtanS = 0.40 to 0.70; A = 0.3; KOtnc = 0.55; m ~ 0.8;
n ~ 0.45, the following approximation suitable for design use is obtained:
/ _ \0.45
a = Cx - (16-I2a)
\Su)
This equation shows that a depends upon both the effective vertical overburden stress q and
the undrained shear strength sM; use Ci = 0.4 to 0.5 for bored piles/piers and > 0.5 for driven
piles.

16-9.2 The A Method
Vijayvergiya and Focht (1972) presented a method of obtaining the skin resistance of a pile
in overconsolidated clays and have claimed a correlation between design and load tests on
the order of ± 10 percent. The original development was based primarily on pile load tests.
These were on long piles used for offshore oil production structures and founded in clays
located in or along the U.S. coastline of the Gulf of Mexico. This method has also been used
in other marine installations with some success (e.g., North Sea oil production structures). In
equation form the method is given as
fs = \(q + 2su) (units of su) (16-13)

where su = undrained shear strength of soil previously defined (kPa, ksf)
q — JsZi effective overburden pressure to the average depth of pile segment or \
full depth. For tapered piles you may have to use element lengths AL and do a
summation, X •
A = coefficient, which can be obtained from Fig. 16-15, is pile length-dependent,
and applies over the total pile embedment depth

etration. Data replotted and depths converted to meters by au-
thor from Vijayvergiya and Focht (1972).

Depth of penetration, m

The A coefficient was obtained from a graphical regression (best-fit) analysis of a plot with
a large number of pile-load tests. If we compare Eq. (16-13) to Eq. (16-11) it is evident the
A term includes both the a and the K tan 5 effects.
Kraft et al. (1981a) studied this method in some detail and made the following observa-
tions:

1. The method overpredicts the capacity for piles when their length L is less than about 15 m
in both normally and overconsolidated clay. For piles in this length range it appears that
0.2 < A < 0.4.
2. The minimum value of A > 0.14.
3. The reduction in A appears attributable to the installation process, which produces more
soil damage in the upper regions since more pile shaft passes a given depth and there is
more likelihood of lateral movement or whip causing permanent pile-soil separation.

Where long piles penetrate into soft clay the A values reflect both averaging for a single
value and development of a somewhat limiting skin resistance so that q does not increase pile
capacity without bound.
This method has one very serious deficiency—it assumes a single value of A for the pile.
A more correct procedure is to use Eq. (16-10) with several elements.

16-9.3 The j3 -Method
This method, suggested by Burland (1973), makes the following assumptions:

1. Soil remolding adjacent to the pile during driving reduces the effective stress cohesion
intercept on a Mohr's circle to zero.
2. The effective stress acting on the pile surface after dissipation of excess pore pressures
generated by volume displacement is at least equal to the horizontal effective stress (K0)
prior to pile installation.

X


3. The major shear distortion during pile loading is confined to a relatively thin zone around
the pile shaft, and drainage of this thin zone either occurs rapidly during loading or has
already occurred in the delay between driving and loading.

With these assumptions Burland (1973) developed a simple design equation [also the sec-
ond term of Eq. (16-11)] written as
fs = Kq tan 8 (16-14«)
Taking /3 = K tan <5, we can rewrite the equation for skin resistance as
/ , = Pq (16-14/7)
Since q = effective overburden pressures at z/, we can modify Eqs. (16-14Z?) for a surcharge
qs to read
f5 = P(q + qs) (16-14c)
As previously used, ~q = average (midheight) effective vertical stress for the /th element of
length AL. The friction angle S must be obtained from Table 11-6 or estimated by some other
means. Since a 4> angle (and S = O when c/> = 0) is needed, the author recommends this
method only for cohesionless soils.
The lateral earth-pressure coefficient K may be designer-selected; however, K0 as defined
for use in Eq. (16-11) is commonly used.
A particularly attractive feature of the /3 method is that if we use K0 = 1 - sin ^ and
S = (/>', the range of /3 is from about 0.27 to 0.30 in the practical range of </>' (range of 25° to
45°). That is, almost any reasonable estimate for (/>' gives the same computed skin resistance;
however, it still remains to be seen from a load test whether it is correct.
Figure 16-16 is a data plot from Flaate and Seines (1977) that was obtained from back-
computing a number of reported load tests using this method. Although there is substantial

scatter it does not seem so great as in using other methods, including both the a and A method,
according to Esrig and Kirby (1979).
Most authorities agree that fs in Eq. (16-11) does not increase indefinitely with depth but
rather, beyond some critical L/B ratio, increases at an ever-decreasing rate. Bhushan (1982)
suggests for large-displacement piles (closed-end pipe, solid concrete, possibly open-end pipe
with a plug) that K and /3 can be estimated as follows:
P = ^ tan S = 0.18 + 0.0065Dr
and
K = 0.50 + 0.008A-
where Dr is the relative density (as a percent) previously defined in Chap. 2. We might use
SPT correlations (see Table 3-4) to obtain Dr at increasing depths.
Zeitlen and Paikowsky (1982) suggest that the limiting fs is automatically accounted for
by the decrease in (/>' with effective normal confining pressure. To obtain </>' at some depth
of interest when a reference value of cf)o is available as from a triaxial test using an effective
normal pressure of qo (and refer to Fig. 2-31) the following equation is suggested
cf>' = cj>o- 5.5 l o g 7^- (16-15)

where (/>' = angle of internal friction for design and is computed from the actual effective
normal pressure r(q existing at the depth of interest (along pile shaft or point).
Use this angle in Eq. (16-6) and Eq. (16-6a).
(f)o = reference angle of internal friction measured at some effective normal pressure
qo in a laboratory test.

We must also make a decision on what to use for tan 8. Some persons suggest a maximum
for S on the order of 0.5 to 0.75(/>', whereas others routinely use the effective value (f)'. It has
already been pointed out that 8 is dependent on the normal pressure at the interface of soil
and pile.
Finally, there is a question of what to use for the lateral earth-pressure coefficient K that
will give a consistent pile capacity estimation for design within, say, a ± 20 percent error.
Several choices for K, given in the text, have been suggested by different authorities; how-
ever, although they tend to provide reasonable (after the fact) computations for their authors,
for others they have the nasty habit of giving unpredictable results.
It appears that K values are very likely to be both site- and pile-type-specific. Table 16-3
tabulates a number of values of K found from several pile test programs. From this table one
can readily see that there is not very good agreement on what to use for K.
It appears that the pile weight was not included in at least some of the pullout tests; and
little to no consideration was given to stratification, to changes in the soil parameters with
depth, or to effective normal confining pressure. Note, too, that a significant variation in K
can be created by the assumption of how much of the load is carried by the point.
The major error in the foregoing back-computations for K was in obtaining a single value
for the full pile depth rather than dividing the pile shaft into lengths of AL and using Eq.
(16-5«) for compression and Eq. (16-5Z?) for tension tests.

Residual driving stresses may be a significant factor; however, the mechanics are not fully
understood nor are there any rational means to quantify them. Although there are claims that
large values have been measured in some cases, it does not seem possible with modern driving
equipment producing rapid hammer blows that large values could exist. In cohesionless soils
the rapid driving impulses and resulting vibrations would create a viscous fluid in a zone sev-
eral millimeters from the pile; a somewhat similar situation would develop in cohesive soils.
Apparently, driving the pile point into rock would be more likely to create residual stresses
since the point resistance would be so large that there could be significant axial compression
from the hammer impact. Some of this compression might become locked in by lateral soil
squeeze and produce compression stresses, which would add to those from the applied butt
load. However, since these stresses are continuous acting there would be sufficient soil (and
pile) creep to cause them to dissipate over a relatively short time.
In sand, on the other hand, other factors may cause an apparent negative skin resistance
(or apparent increase in compressive load). These include driving other piles in the vicinity,
heavy construction equipment in the area causing vibration-induced settlement, and the like.
One of the more serious errors in static pile capacity analyses has been the use of a single
correlation factor or parameter for the full embedment depth. A trend is developing, however,
to subdivide the estimated pile depth into a number of elements or segments, analyze these,
and use their sum as in Eq. (16-10). This trend is accelerating because of computer programs
such as PILCAPAC, so that computations considering the several strata in embedment length
L are little more difficult than using a single skin resistance parameter.
Consideration of soil property variation in length L can make a substantial difference,
particularly for long piles in clay where a pile of, say, L/D = 30 may fall entirely within
an overconsolidated region, whereas with L/D = 50 perhaps one-third of the depth is in
normally or underconsolidated clay. Similarly for sand, the upper depth may be recent and
the lower one-third to one-half may be overconsolidated and/or cemented material. Making a
static capacity prediction that compares favorably with a later load test is more a coincidence
than the result of using a "good" equation in these circumstances. This observation is also


the most likely explanation of why the computed agreement with load tests on short piles is
better than on long piles.
It is usually easier to back-compute a load test with considerable confidence of what the
parameter(s) should be than to make a capacity forecast with little more than SPT numbers
and possibly unconfined compression strength data from disturbed samples recovered in the
SPT sampling procedure.

16-9.4 Other Methods to Compute/Estimate Skin Resistance
There are a number of other computational procedures for obtaining fs for the skin resistance
contribution of Eq. (16-5). Vesic (1970) used relative density Dr as follows:
/, = ^ d O ) 1 5 4 D * (kPa) (16-16)

where Xv = % for large-volume displacement piles
= 2.5 for bored, open-end pipe and for HP piles

According to Vesic (1975a) Eq. (16-16) may be a lower limit, and most load tests tend to
produce average values at least 50 percent greater.
For SPT data, Meyerhof (1956, 1976) suggested obtaining fs as
fs = XmN55 (kPa) (16-17)

where Xm = 2.0 for piles with large-volume displacement
= 1.0 for small-volume piles
N55 = statistical average of the blow count in the stratum (and with any corrections
from Chap. 3)

Shioi and Fukui (1982) suggest the following:
For driven piles: fs = 2NS>55 for sand; = \0Nc>55 for clay (kPa)
For bored piles: fs = INS>55 for sand; = 5NC>55 for clay (kPa)
where A ^ = average blow count in the material indicated for the pile or pile segment
length

For cone penetration data, Meyerhof (1956) and Thorburn and Mac Vicar (1971) suggest
fs = 0.005^c (kPa) (16-18)
where qc = cone penetration resistance, kPa.
When a cone penetrometer is used and side friction qs is measured, use
fs = qs (small-volume displacement piles)
fs = (1.5 to 2.0)qs (large-volume piles)
16-9.5 Step-Taper and Tapered Piles
Most published pile tests have been made on straight shafts. Only a limited amount of
data exists on tapered or step-taper piles in a form where one can reanalyze (easily or even


approximately) the work. The major sources seem to be D'Appolonia and Hriber (1963),
Tavenas (1971), and a number of issues of Foundation Facts.2 Generally, one may make
the analysis on the basis of Fig. 16-17. Use the average pile shaft diameter in the length
AL. This increment of shaft length may be either the stratum thickness or the total or partial
pile segment. The additional bearing capacity (which may not be an "ultimate" value) from
the bearing ledges or changes in diameter of the step-taper can be summed with the point
resistance to obtain the total bearing contribution.
From Fig. 16-17 the skin resistance contribution [see Nordlund (1963)] is

where K = earth-pressure coefficient. Tests reported and data analyzed by the author in-
dicate K = 1.7 to 2.2KO for tapered and step-tapered piles. Meyerhof (1976)
suggests K > 1.5 and Blanchet et al. (1980) suggest K = 2KO.
a) = angle of taper of pile shaft

Other terms have been previously defined.
For all practical purposes the trigonometric ratio in Eq. (16-19) is tan <f)' unless the taper
is very large. This substitution produces Eq. (16-14a) except that load tests tend to indicate
larger K values for tapered piles. The user must make some estimate for the limiting skin
resistance in Eq. (16-19) since it is not unlimited with q regardless of taper.

16-9.6 Bearing Capacity of Pile/Pier Ledges
The step-taper pile has a ledge that contributes to the pile capacity. Few other pile types have
this "ledge," but it is common with drilled piers (see Chap. 19) to drill the upper part at a
larger diameter than the lower to produce a bearing ledge. There can be more than one ledge
in a pile or pier. We may make an analysis as follows for the ledge contribution:

1. Referring to Fig. 16-17c, determine the bearing capacity q^ of a round footing of diameter
D0 = 2ro using the Hansen bearing-capacity equation for pile points. Use q from ground
surface to ledge and the soil properties 0, c below the ledge.
2. Compute the area of the ledge using r0 and r,- as
AL = ir(r2o - r?)
3. Compute the ledge resistance as
PL = ALqL
which is summed with the other resistances P1- to obtain the total pile capacity.

16-10 PILE SETTLEMENTS
Pile settlements can be estimated as follows:

1. Compute the average pile axial force in each segment of length AL, average cross-section
area Aav, and shaft modulus of elasticity Ep from the pile butt to point. That is,
AW - P a v A L

and sum the several values to obtain the axial total compression
AHa =J]AHS,S
2. Compute the point settlement using Eq. (5-16a) given below

(5-16«)


where mls = 1.0 (shape factor)
IF = Fox embedment factor, with values as follows:
IF = 0.55 if LlD < 5
= 0.50 if LlD > 5
D = diameter of pile point (or the bell diameter for belled piers), or the least
lateral dimension for rectangular or HP sections
/JL = Poisson's ratio (suggest using /JL = 0.35)
Ag = bearing pressure at point = input load/A^. This is the pile load, not the
point load
Es = stress-strain modulus of soil below the pile point (may be obtained from
Table 5-6 with the following as typical):
SPT: Es = 500(N + 15)
CPT: Es = 3 to 6qc (use larger values 5, 6 if OCR > 1)
su: Es = 100 to 500s u (Ip > 30)
- 500 to 1500sM (Ip < 30 or is stiff)

For OCR > 1: £,,OCR « E5 VOCR
Fi = reduction factor used as follows:
0.25 if the axial skin resistance reduces the point load Pp < 0
0.50 if the point load Pp > 0
0.75 if point bearing (there is always some skin resistance)

The factor Fi is used to account for the tip zone moving down as a result of both actual
point load (which is seldom known) and the point settlement from skin resistance along
the shaft "pushing" the system down in some zone radiating from the shaft as indicated in
Fig. 16-lla. This method uses the total axial load, which is known, and factor Fj, which
is an estimate. You may have to use a local value or modify the Fi suggested here for
different stratification.
3. Sum the axial and point settlements to obtain the total as
HHp = AHa + Atfpt
Note again the point settlement includes a side resistance contribution through the use
of the Fi factor.

How accurate is this settlement computation? Like most pile analyses, if it gives exactly
the measured settlement it is more likely a happy coincidence from the equation and the
user's choice of input. This method is incorporated into program PILCAPAC and has given
quite good results compared with measured values. In any case it is better than just making
a guess.


A more computationally rigorous solution is suggested by Randolph and Wroth (1979) and
somewhat verified and extended by Lee (1993). The equation3 for the settlement of a single
pile LHP with an embedment depth Lp is as follows:

(16-20)

where, in consistent force and length units,
Ep = modulus of elasticity of pile material
G'L = shear modulus at pile point; compute from E5 (see step 2 given earlier) using
Eq. (a) of Sec. 2-14
G'L/2 = shear modulus at pile embedment depth Lp/2
Lp = pile embedment length; Lp/2 = one-half embedment depth
ro = effective pile radius in units of Lp. Use actual pile radius for round piles; for
square or projected area of HP piles use ro = JAP/TT.
rm = kpLp(l - /x), where
k = 2.5 for friction piles in soil where stratum thickness H > 3LP\ = 2.0
for H < 3LP
rm = Lp(^ + [2p(l - /UL) — |]£) for end-bearing piles (and in this case use 77 = 1)

16-11 STATIC PILE CAPACITY: EXAMPLES
The following examples will illustrate some of the methods given in the preceding sections.

Example 16-2. An HP360 X 132 (14 X 89) pile penetrates through 9 m of soft clay and soft silty
clay into 1 m of a very dense, gravelly sand for a total pile length L= 10 m. The GWT is at 1.5 m
below the ground surface. The pile was driven essentially to refusal in the dense sand. The SPT blow
count prior to driving ranged from 3 to 10 in the soft upper materials and from 40 to 60 in the dense

3The equation has not been derived by the author, but the two references cited used the same general form, so it is
assumed to be correct.


sand. On this basis it is decided to assume the pile is point bearing and receives no skin resistance
contribution from the soft clay. We know there will be a considerable skin resistance contribution,
but this design method is common. We will make a design using Meyerhof's Eq. (16-8) and using
Eq. (16-6) with Vesic's N-factors but neglecting the N7 term.

Solution.
By Meyerhof's method. Assuming the blow counts given are N-JO, we need the N55 value. If we use
an average blow count N70 = 50,
N55 = ^70(70/55) = 50(70/55) = 64
For an HP360 X 132 we obtain bf = 373 X d = 351 mm (using Appendix Table A-I). The pro-
jected point area Ap = bf X d = 0.373 X 0.351 = 0.131 m2.
The LjB ratio in the sand is
Lb/B = 1.000/0.351 = 2.85 (use smallest dimension for B)
Using Meyerhof's Eq. (16-8), we calculate
^pu = Ap(A0N55)Lb/B = 0.131 x 40 X 64 X 2.85 = 956 kN
Checking the limiting Ppu>m, we obtain
PPu,m = Ap(3S0N55) = 0.131 x 380 X 64 = 3186 kN » 956
Tentatively use Meyerhof's Ppu = 956 kN.
By Eq. (16-6). Assume </> = 40° (from Table 3-4—range of 30 to 50°) and also the following:
ys = 16.5kN/m3for9m y' = 16.5 -9.807 = 6.7
= 18.5 kN/m3 for I m y' = 18.5 - 9.807 = 8.7
q = 16.5 X 1.5 + 6.7(9.0 - 1.5) + 8.7 X 1.0 = 83.7 kPa
r, - 1 + 2 ( 1 ; S i " 4 Q O ) = 0.571
7]q = 0.571 X 83.7 = 47.8 kPa (for estimating /rr)
Note that /rr is based on both Dr and the mean normal stress iqq, so we now assume Ir = /rr = 75.
Using program FFACTOR (option 10) with <j> = 40° and /rr = 75, we obtain
N'q = 115.8
For dq obtain the 2 tan... term = 0.214 from Table 4-4 and compute
dq = 1 +0.214 ten'\L/B) = 1 + 0.214 tan"1 (10/0.351)
= 1.33
Substituting values, we see that
Ppu = Apj)qN'qdq = 0.131 X 0.571 X 83.7 X 115.8 X 1.33 = 964 kN
We would, in this case, use Ppu ~ 950 kN.

Example 16-3. Estimate the ultimate pile capacity of a 300-mm round concrete pile that is 30 m
long with 24 m driven into a soft clay soil of average qu = 24 kPa. Assume y' = 8.15 kN/m3 for
the soil. The water surface is 2 m above the ground line.


Solution. We will use both the a and A methods. With the a method we will use a single value and
then divide the pile into four 6-m lengths and use Eq. (16- 12a) to compute the several a's.
Step 1. Find pile area and perimeter:
Ap = 0.7854(0.30)2 = 0.071 m2
Perimeter p = TTD = IT X 0.30 = 0.942 m
Step 2. For any of the methods the point capacity Ppu = 9sMApandsM = qu/2 = 24/2 = 12kPa—•
Ppu = 9 x 12x0.071 = 7.7 kN.
Step 3. Using a single a and from Fig. 16-14 we obtain a = 1.05 (Bowies' curve) and

Pu = Ppu + OLSUAS
= 7.7 + 1.05 X 12 X 0.942 X 24 = 7.7 + 284.9 = 292.6 kN

Step 4. Using the A method and a copier enlargement of Fig. 16-15, we obtain, at D =
24 m, A ~ 0.16. Also we must compute the average vertical stress in the 24-m depth:
q = y'Lp/2 = 8.15 X 24/2 = 97.8 kPa
Substituting into Eq. (16-13) with A^ = 0.942 X 24 = 22.6 m2 gives
Pp = Pp u + X(q + 2su)As
= 7.7 + 0.16(97.8 4- 2 X 12)22.6 = 7.7 + 440.4 = 448.1 kN

Step 5. Using Eq. (16-12a) for a with four segments, we make the following computations:
qv = 8.15X3 = 24.5 kPa
Then with su = 12, we compute
a = 0.5(24.5/12)045 = 0.69 (C, = 0.5)
As = pAL = 0.942 x 6 = 5.65 m2
fs = asu = 0.69 X 12 = 8.28
fsAs = 8.28X5.65 = 46.8 kN
With the computation methodology established, set up the following table (not including top 2 m
and using ground surface as the reference):

Summarizing, we write

Single a 292.6
Multiple a 339.3
The A method 448.1

What would be a reasonable value of Pp to recommend for this pile capacity? A value of about
350 kN could be justified. The single a is too low (but conservative); the A does not consider any
depth variation.
Since the pile is concrete, its weight is (yc = 23.6 kN/m3) = 0.071 X 23.6 X 30 = 50 kN, and
the actual reported value should be
PP,rep = Pp ~ W = 350 - 50 = 300 kN
////

Example 16-4. Estimate the pile length required to carry the 670 kN axial load for the pile-soil
system shown in Fig. E16-4. The 460-mm pipe is to be filled with concrete after driving.

Solution. We will make length estimates based on both the a and A methods and use an average of
the two unless there is a large difference.
By the a method. Use two depth increments since we have a soil variation that is clearly identified.
If there were more data it would be prudent to use additional depth increments. From Fig. 16-14 we
obtain
a = 0.98 for first 6 m
a = 0.88 for remainder (stiffer soil)
Use point Nc = 9.0. We then compute the following:
Point area Ap = 0.7854D2 = 0.7854 X 0.4602 = 0.166 m2
Pile perimeter p = TTD = TT X 0.460 = 1.45 m

Figure E16-4

Medium stiff clay
c = 55 kPa
y= 19.81 kN/m3

Soft clay
c = 30 kPa
y = 18.5 kN/m3


Skin resistance is usually neglected in the top 0.6 to 1 m of depth because of excessive soil damage
from driving; we will not do this here since the upper soil is very soft and likely to flow back against
the pile perimeter.
We can write the pile capacity as
P11 = Px + P2 + PP Pp = cNcAp dP = p(ac)dL
giving
f6 (Ll
Pu — p(pi\C\)dL + p(a.2C2)dL + c29Ap (note integration over 0 to L1 not 6 to L1)
Jo Jo
Substituting, we find that
f6 fLl
Pu = (0.98 X 30 X \A5)dL + (0.88 X 55 X \A5)dL + 55 X 9 X 0.166
Jo Jo
Clearing, we obtain
Pu = 29A X 1.45 X 6.0 + 48.4 X 1.45Li + 82.0
Pu = 256 + 70.2L1 + 82 = 70.2L1 + 338
Using an SF = 3 and equating, we have
Pu ^ 3Pa
and replacing the > with an equal sign, we have Pu = 3 X 670 = 2010 kN, or
70.2L1 + 338 = 2010
Solving for L\, we find
L1 = 1672/70.2 = 23.8 m (say, 24 m)
Total Lt = 6.0 + L1 = 6 + 24 = 30 m
By the A Method. Find the equivalent su for the full stratum. Based on side computations, which
indicate the required total depth may be around 32 m, we see that
6 X 3 0 + 26X55
su>av = — = 5OkPa (rounded)

We also need an average effective unit weight for this soil depth in order to compute q to mid-depth
of the pile:
6 x 1 8 . 5 + 2 6 ( 1 9 . 8 1 - 9 . 8 1 ) 1 O A l X T / 3 , AA,
yay = ^r = 12.0 kN/m (rounded)

For an assumed L = 32 m, we obtain (using an enlargement of Fig. 16-15) A = 0.14. The point
capacity is the same as for the a method of Ppu = 82 kN. Thus,
P s = AsX{q + 2 s u ) A s = p X L = 1 . 4 5 L
Substituting values, we obtain a quadratic equation in L as
1.45L(0.14)[12 X L/2 + 2 X 50] + 82 = 3 X 670
1.22L2 + 20.3L = 1928
Solving for L, we obtain L = 32.3 m (use 32 m).


Solution. We will find the length using the a and /3 methods and then make a decision on what to
use for the pile length L. Note the given conditions state a friction pile, so there is no point capacity
to compute.
By the a method. First, let us average the qu values to obtain
qu = ^ 1 = 608/11 = 55.3 su = qu/2 = 55.3/2 = 28 kPa
For su = 2 8 k P a u s e a = 0.98 (Fig. 16-14)
The pile dimensions are b = 378 mm and d = 361 mm (Table A-I in Appendix). Thus, the
perimeter (assuming full plug) is
p = Id + 2b = 2(0.361 + 0.378) = 1.48 m (rounded)
We will neglect the pile weight since we are also neglecting any point capacity. So with an SF = 2,

PL*,. = 2 X 6 7 5 and L= ^ ^ x ^ = 33.2 m

By the /J method. We must somehow estimate an effective angle of friction </>'. We can do this by
using an average of the plasticity indexes to obtain

By a method L = 30 m
By A method L = 32 m
Use L = 32 m (if the pile can be driven that deep)

Example 16-5. Find the required length of HP360 X 174 friction pile to carry an axial load of 675
kN using an SF = 2. The accompanying table is an abbreviated soil profile for use:


From Fig. 2-35 at IP = 13 we obtain </>' = 32° ("undisturbed" clays). The pile friction is made up
of two parts:

Soil-to-pile -> 8 = 25° (see Table 11-6)—the two flanges
Soil-to-soil —> 8 = 30° (not 32° as web soil may be somewhat disturbed)

We need an average soil unit weight, so with the GWT at - 3 m depth we will average all the values
as being sufficiently precise.
yav = (17.5 + 17.9 + • • • + 19.7)/11 = 206.6/11 = 18.8 kN/m3
The effective unit weight y'e = 18.8 - 9.8 = 9.0 kN/m3.
We will next compute the lateral pressure coefficient K:
Ka = 0.307 Kp = 3.255 (Rankine values from Tables 11-3, 11-4)
K0 = I - sin0 = 1 - sin32° = 0.470
We will weight K0 using Fw = 2, giving
K = 0-307+ 2 x 0 . 4 7 0 + 3.255 = ^ 4 _ ^

Now equating total skin resistance Psu > SF X given load, obtain
Psu = piLqKtanS1 + p2LqKt<m82 > 2 X 675 = 135OkN
Now substituting (with p, = 2b = 2x0.378 = 0.756 m; p2 = 2x0.361 = 0.722 m; q = qL/1),
we find

0.756LX9X ^ X I.13tan25° + O.722LX9X ^ X 1.13tan30° = 1350

Simplifying, we obtain
1.79L2 + 2.12L2 = 1350-> 3.91L2 = 1350

Summary.

By the a method: L = 33.2 m
By the )8 method: L = 18.6 m

Which L do we use? There is too much difference to use an average of 25.9 m. It would be prudent
here to use L > 30 m, particularly because too many "estimates" were used in the /3 method.
////

Example 16-6. We are given the following data for a step-taper pile (from Foundation Facts, vol.
1, no. 2, fall 1965, p. 17, and slightly edited). The pile capacity was estimated to be 227 kips. There
was no water, and only SPT data were furnished. Note: This problem is worked in Fps units since
those were the units of the original data.

Required. Estimate the pile capacity using Eq. (16-19) and include the ledge contributions based
on bearing capacity.


Solution. It is necessary to obtain the shaft diameters from Raymond International pile literature
as shown on Fig. E16-6. From Table 3-4 estimate the 4> angles given in the computation table
following, which are based on the SPTs being N^ values.
We will have to compute the following:
AL = 0.7854Oj - r2), ft2 (ledge areas)
A5 = TjDL5, ft2 (shaft area)
K0 = 1 - sine/) /3 = 2#otan<£
Pu = y , ^ledg + y , Psi + ^pu

We will compute a "design" value for Nq that is an approximate average of the Terzaghi and Hansen
values. We will use the following table and transfer the Nq values to Table E16-6. Refer to Table
4-5 for computing sq, dq.

A typical computation for the ledge resistance at the base of top section is
P = ALyLNq = 0.14 X 0.100 X 8 X 31 = 3 . 5 kips
For side resistance we find that

. . . , etc. The TV7 term for the ledges and tip is ignored.
Both ys and <f> have been estimated for this site. Experience will be a determining factor in what
values probably should be used. From using Table 3-4 with the blow counts N as a guide, the values
used are certainly not unreasonable—if anything, they are conservative. Why use an average of the
Terzaghi and Hansen values for Nql The reason is the Hansen values tend to be large when shape
and depth factors are included but the Terzaghi values are too small since they have no means of
adjustment. A logical progression is to compute the two and average them.
The sum of ledge, side, and point resistance is
27.0 4- 99.8 + 92.3 = 219.1 kips (vs. 227 measured)
Questions.

1. Should SPT N have been corrected for overburden etc?
2. Is the range of 30 to 34° more realistic than perhaps 34 to 38°?
3. Is using/3 = 2KO tan </> preferable to using /3 = 1.5 to 2.0?

Clearly, the answer (now that the outcome is known) to these questions is no, yes, yes—but the
designer seldom knows the outcome in advance.

Example 16-7. This example uses the computer program PILCAPAC that has been cited several
times. From the output you can get an idea of how to write your own computer program (or obtain
this one). To illustrate the versatility of the program and for your verification of methods given
in this chapter to compute static pile capacity, we shall consider a load test from ASCE Special
Publication No. 23 [see Finno (1989)] on a 50-ft HP 14X 73 pile. The soil profile is shown in Fig.
E16-7« together with selected other data. The soil properties were estimated from the given soil
boring data and any supplemental data provided by Finno. The pile cross section and other data are
in Appendix Table A-1 of this text. Fps units are used in this example since the original source
uses those units and it would be difficult to check results if the original parameters were converted
to SI.

Solution. A data file was created and named ASCEPLO, as shown on the output sheets (Fig. E16-
Ib). Most of the soil data are echoed in the table labeled "Soil Data for Each Layer." Although only
layers 2 through 8 provide skin resistance, nine layers are shown. The ninth (bottom) layer is for
computing point capacity. Both <fi and 8 are shown. The program checks whether this is an H pile
and if so uses the given tan 8 on the flanges and 1.28 for the web, which is soil-to-soil.


Figure E16-7a
The program computes K (K-FACT) on output sheets using
„ _ Ka + FWKO + Kp
K YTK
For the first value (the first layer is never used so, having the option of program computing or
inputting a value) I input 0.9. The second layer has ^ = 36°, giving Ka = 0.2596; # p = 3.8518;
K0 = 1 - sin 36° = 0.4122; and K = (0.2596 +0.4122+ 3.8581)/3 = 1.5 (rounded). Other values
are computed similarly.
The program has the option of using either (or both) the Hansen or Terzaghi point bearing-
capacity method. The Hansen method was chosen as noted, and sufficient data were output for a
hand check.
Next the program inquires whether to use the a or /3 method. The a method is selected as shown
and the skin resistances for each element are computed and written for a hand check. Note the
following when checking here:

This zone is ignored
in computations.

1. The top 2-ft element is not used because of driving damage.
2. The friction shows two "DEL ANGS" (24° and 1.2 X 24° = 28:8°) are used—24° for the flanges
and 28.8° for the web. Pipe piles would use the input 8 since the full perimeter is soil-to-steel.
3. The sum of skin resistance + point resistance gives 225.97 kips [the measured value was between
220 and 237 kips after 43 weeks—see page 345 of Finno (1989)]. For design you would divide
this ultimate capacity by a suitable SF.

These values are also output to the screen, and the program inquires if a settlement estimate is
desired. You can input either a design load here or the ultimate load just computed. I input 226 kips
as shown on the output sheet since I wanted a check of the load test settlement. The program allows
a number of materials (steel, concrete, wood) so it asks me for the modulus of elasticity of the pile
and I input 4 176 000 ksf (for steel). For point settlement a modulus of elasticity of the ninth soil
layer is required. I input 450 ksf (approximately 450sM) on request as shown. The program then
computed the point settlement and the accumulated side settlements. The point settlement uses the


modified Eq. (5-16«) as given in Sec. 16-10 with If = 0.5; the value DQ shown = 226/Ap (point
area is given earlier as 1.379 ft2); and the largest point dimension is BMAX = 1.22 ft. These are
used with /JL = 0.35 to compute the point settlement (with these data you can work backward to see
what the program used for Fi). The total settlement is 1.29 in. (program converts feet to inches for
this output). The measured value was in the range of 1.2 to 1.5 in.

16-12 PILES IN PERMAFROST
Piles are used in permafrost regions to control differential settlement from volume changes
caused by freeze-thaw cycles. This is accomplished by isolation of the superstructure from
the ice-rich soil by either an air space or a space filled with insulation material. The load
capacity is usually obtained via the adfreeze4 bond between the pile surface and a slurry of
soil or other material used as a backfill in the cavity around the pile. Sometimes capacity is
obtained by end bearing if competent strata are found at a reasonable depth. In most cases
the pile-soil-ice interaction provides the significant portion of the load capacity, particularly
where the pile penetrates ice-rich fine-grained soils.
Piles may be driven into the frozen ground; however, in remote areas transport of heavy
equipment for driving is costly and alternative means are often preferred. The principal al-
ternative is to auger a hole in which the pile is placed. The remaining cavity is backfilled
with a slurry of water and coarse sand or with soil removed from the hole, which freezes to
the pile to produce the adhesion used for load resistance. Often the loads to be carried are not
large, so that small hand-powered auger equipment can be used to drill a hole of sufficient
diameter and depth for the small piles required. Next upward in cost would probably be use
of a truck-mounted auger. Low-energy driving equipment is sometimes used to insert piles
into slightly undersized predrilled holes.
Care is necessary when adding the soil-water slurry (about 150-mm slump) if the tem-
perature is below freezing so that an ice film with a greatly lowered skin resistance does not
prematurely form on the pile shaft, from accidental wetting. Skin resistance can be signifi-
cantly increased by adding shear connectors (rings, collars, or other) to the shaft. Certain of
these devices may be used to circulate refrigerant [Long (1973)] where the mean ground tem-
perature is close to freezing and the pile loads are large. In other cases the shear connectors
can be added to steel piles by welding suitable protrusions to the shaft.
Principal pile materials in cold regions are timber, steel pipe, and HP shapes. Timber is
probably the most economical in the remote regions of Canada and Alaska but may require
weighting to avoid floating out of the hole when slurry is placed. Preservative may be painted
on the pile but pressure treating is preferred; untreated piles have only a short service life
(perhaps as little as two years), depending on wood quality, but may be adequate for certain
installations. Cast-in-place concrete is not much used because of possible freezing prior to
hydration, and precast concrete piling has a serious economic disadvantage from weight.
Steel piles can be driven into fine-grained frozen soils using diesel and vibratory hammers if
the air temperature is not much lower than —4°C. Rarely, steam jetting may be used to aid in
pile insertion but the long resulting refreeze time is a serious disadvantage.

4Adfreeze is adhesion developed between pile and soil-water mixture as the water turns to ice (or freezes).


Pile Design
The principal design criteria are to control ice creep settlements and ensure adequate adfreeze
skin resistance. Both of these factors are temperature-dependent. In turn, these require using
very low adhesion stresses (high safety factor) in design and an assessment of the probable
high temperature since adhesion increases (while creep decreases) with lower temperature.
The ultimate adfreeze stress is difficult to estimate but depends on at least the following:

1. Ground temperature (very important). Since the ground temperature varies from the active
zone to the steady-state zone, the adfreeze varies similarly.
2. Initial (unfrozen) water content. Pure ice gives a lesser adfreeze than a frozen soil-water
mixture.
3. Pile material. It appears from the limited test data available that wood and steel piles have
approximately the same adfreeze resistance, with concrete slightly higher.
4. Soil (sand, silt, clay, etc.). Fine-sand- or silt-water mixtures seem to produce the highest
adfreeze stresses. Gravels produce very low adfreeze—almost none unless saturated.
5. Soil density. Higher soil density increases adhesion and reduces creep.
6. Strain rate (low strain rates tend to lower adfreeze strengths).

Based on the work of Laba (1974), Tsytovich (1975), Penner and Irwin (1969), Penner
and Gold (1971), Andersland and Anderson (1978), and Parameswaran (1978), the ultimate
adfreeze /au of several materials can be based on the following equation:
/a u = M1 + M2 (J)0 7 kPa (16-21)
where T = degrees below 00C
M\ = 0 for pure ice; about 40 foi silty soils and 70 for sand
M2 = 75 for pure ice; about 80 for silty soils and gravel and about 150 for fine-to-
medium sand

Orders of magnitude of /a u for ambient soil temperatures of - 1 and -3°C seem to be as
follows:

Soil Wood Steel Concrete
kPa

Sand 400-1600 625-1000 500-3000
Silt 120-1000
Clay 300-1200 100-1300 500-1300
Gravel < 160

There is a wide variation in the adfreeze values obtained and, of course, they depend some-
what on how the temperature variations have been accounted for. In general, the lower values
just given would be applicable for temperatures close to 00C. Below about - 1 0 to —12°C
the adfreeze reaches some limiting value.
The ultimate pile point stress in permafrost may be estimated [Long (1973)] at from 3 to
10 times the ultimate skin adfreeze stress. In any case a substantial safety factor should be
applied and careful consideration should be given to whether to use any point contribution


since it is developed only after substantial adfreeze slip (and stress reduction) has occurred.
Substantial slip may occur for skin resistance > 50 kPa [Nixon (1988)].
Creep is the second major factor for consideration in pile foundation design. Several re-
searchers have addressed this problem, with recommendations being given by Morgenstern
et al. (1980) and Biggar and Sego (1994). The general form of the creep equation is
Ua = 3(*+1)/2(/ad)nM3 ( 1 6 _ 2 2 )

where ua = creep rate per year
B = pile diameter
n = creep parameter—current value = 3
/ad = design (actual) adfreeze stress, kPa
MT, = creep parameter with following values:

T,° C M3X 10 8, kPa "/year*
- 1 4.5
- 2 2.0
- 5 1.0
-10 0.56

*Increase A/3 by 10 if salinity increases
from 0 to 10 ppt. Increase M3 by 100
if salinity increases from 20 to 30 ppt.
(ppt = parts per thousand)

Pile Spacing
The latent heat of the soil-water slurry mixture and the additional heat loss required to reduce
the slurry to the ambient temperature of the permafrost will control pile spacing. This spacing
is based on the heat (calories) necessary to convert the water to ice at no change in temperature
(latent heat) and then to lower the slurry temperature from that at placing to the ambient
temperature (sensible heat). The latent heat of pure water is 778 Btu or approximately 79.7
g • cal. There are 4.185 joules (J) in 1 Btu or in 1 g • cal. For latent heat HL of the water in
the slurry in a unit volume ( I m 3 ) based on the slurry water content wm (decimal) and dry
density pd in g/cm3, and noting (100 cm)3 gives m3 and MJ, we can calculate the following:
HL = 79.7 X 4.185 X p ^ X wm = 333.6 X pd X wm MJ/m3 (16-23)
The volumetric heat capacity (unit volume) is based on the heat capacity of the soil cs and of
the water in the slurry to obtain
blurry = Pd(cs + cw)4.185 = pd(cs + wm)4.185 MJ/m3 (16-24)
Values of heat capacity cs for soils range from 0.15 to about 0.22 with most values around
0.16 to 0.18. Mitchell and Kao (1978) describe several methods that can be used to measure
heat capacity or specific heat of soils.

Example 16-8. A timber pile is to carry 150 kN in a silty permafrost. The active zone is 2 m. Al-
though the best data are obtained from a soil temperature profile, we will take the average ambient


temperature at —3°C for the soil below the active zone. The diameter of the pile will be taken as an
average of 200 mm. This will be placed in a 310-mm predrilled hole and backfilled with a slurry at
wm = 40 percent and pd — 1.25 g/cm3. The slurry placement temperature is +30C. The permafrost
density is pd = 1-35 g/cm3 and WN = 35 percent.

Required.

1. Find the approximate length of the pile if 1.0 m is above ground and there is no point contribution.
2. Find the approximate spacing needed to limit the permafrost temperature to —1.0° C (or less)
when slurry is placed.
3. Check settlements at the end of two years.

Solution, a. Find the pile length. Based on Eq. (16-21),
/au = Mx + M2(T)0-7 = 40 + 80(3)07 = 213 kPa
From tests on several pile materials, the values for /au range from 120 to 1000 for wood; use /au =
250 kPa. For SF = 4 (arbitrary assumption),

/ad = 2^- = 62.5 kPa (say, 60 kPa)

Now, find the length [using Eq. (16-10) with fs = /ad] and add 2 m for the active zone and 1 m for
the above-ground projection,
TT B L' fad = P a
L' = ^ m m ^ - 9 1 m (say'4m)
L = 4 + 2 + l = 7 m
b. Find the approximate pile spacing. Using cs = 0.18 g-cal and from Eq. (16-24), we calculate
blurry = pd(cs + wm)4.185 = 1.25(0.18 + 0.40)4.185 = 3.03 MJ/m3
permafrost = 1.35(0.18 + 0.35)4.185 = 2.99 MJ/m3 (same cs for both soils)
The latent heat in slurry water from Eq. (16-23) is
HL = 333.6pdwm = 333.6(1.25)0.40 = 1.67 MJ/m3
The average volume of slurry per meter of pile embedment is
ys = 0.7854(0.312 - 0.202)(l) = 0.044 m3/m
We will assume the heat lost from the slurry equals the heat gain in the cylinder of permafrost
surrounding the pile. The potential heat transfer to the permafrost per meter of embedment depth is
Q = VSX[HL + (Ti - 7»cs l u n y ]
= 0.044(167 + [3 - (-l)]3.03} = 7.88 MJ/m3
This Q is adsorbed based on a spacing s (diameter s of volume centered on a pile is also pile spacing)
to give


c. Estimate the settlement of the pile at the end of 2 years. We will use Eq. (16-22) and interpolate
M3 = 1.5 X 10~8 at -3°C (no salt). Also /ad = 60 kPa. Substituting values, we find
u 32(1.5X 10-8)(60)3 , c irx 2 ,
^ = — 3 _ 1 A = 1.5 x IO"2 year"1

AH = -X Bx time, years = X 0.20 X 2 yr = 0.006 m
B J yr J

Summary.

L = 7 m (total length)
5 > 1.3 m (center-to-center spacing)
A// = 6 mm (estimated settlement)

16-13 STATIC PILE CAPACITY USING LOAD-TRANSFER
LOAD-TEST DATA
The static capacity and settlement AH of a pile can be back-computed from load-transfer
data obtained from one or more test piles that are sufficiently instrumented with strain gauges
and/or telltales (see Fig. 16-1 Sb). Telltales are rods used to measure accurately the movements
of ledges welded a known distance from a reference point on the butt end of the pile. Sleeves
are welded to the pile shaft above the ledge so a rod can be inserted to the ledge to measure the
displacement after the pile has been driven and some load increment applied. Strain gauges,
if used, can be calibrated to give the stress in the pile at the gauge location directly and
corroborate the telltale.
The difference in measured load (or stress) between any two points is taken as the load
transferred to the soil by skin resistance and is assumed constant in the segment length. The
shear resistance is readily computed since the pile perimeter and segment length are known.
The segment deformation can be computed using the average axial load in the expression
PL/AE, and if the point displacement is known or assumed, the segment movement (termed
slip) is known. A curve of slip versus shear resistance can then be plotted as in Fig. 16-18c for
later use in estimating static capacity for surrounding piles. Note that several load increments
must be applied to the pile in order to develop a load-transfer curve, and in general, more
than one curve of the type shown in Fig. 16-18c is required to model the pile-soil response
reasonably. A load transfer curve can be developed for each pile segment AL over the shaft
length Lp. Segments are defined by strain gauges or telltales located at each end of the lengths
AL. If adjacent segment curves are quite similar, a composite can be used; otherwise, one
would use the individual curves.
The pile capacity computations can be made by hand [Coyle and Reese (1966)] or using a
computer program [Bowles (1974a)]. Hand calculations are practical for no more than three
to five pile segments (three are shown in Fig. 16-18a). Better results may be obtained using
a larger number of segments if there are sufficient load-transfer curves and the data are of
good quality.
Basically, the load-transfer method proceeds as follows:


Figure 16-18 Method of computing load-settlement relationships for an axially loaded pile in clay. [After Coyle
and Reese (1966).]
1. Divide the pile into a number of segments as shown in Fig. 16-18a using any stratification
and shape of load-transfer curves as a guide.
2. Assume a small tip displacement Ayp (zero may be used but generally the point will
displace some finite amount unless it is on rock).
3. Compute the point resistance Pp from this assumed point displacement. One may apply a
soil "spring" using an estimated ks or use the Theory of Elasticity equation for A// given
in Chap. 5 [Eq. (5-16a) see Sec. 16-10]. Using the modulus of subgrade reaction ks, we
may write
Pp = ApksAyp
4. Compute the average movement (or slip) of the bottom segment. For a first approxima-
tion assume the movement is Ayp. From the appropriate load-transfer curve of slip versus
shear strength obtain the corresponding shear resistance for this value of Ayp. For example

(Fig. 16-18c), if slip is 0.2 X 10 = 2.0 mm, the corresponding shear strength is 55 kPa.
The axial load in the pile at the top of the segment (segment 3 in Fig. 16-18a) is the point
load + load carried by skin resistance or
P3 = Pp + L3 X perimeter X T3
Now recompute the element slip using

and obtain a new shear resistance. Recycle until slip used and slip computed are in satis-
factory convergence. Note that absolute convergence is nearly impossible and would be
of more computed accuracy than the data would justify.
5. With convergence in the bottom segment, proceed to the next segment above (segment
2 in Fig. 16-18a). A first estimate of slip in that segment is the last computed slip (Aj3)
of the element just below. From this slip obtain the corresponding shear resistance and
compute the pile load (P2) in the top of that segment. With values of P2 (of this case) and
P3 obtain a revised slip as
(Pi + Pi)L2
A,2 = Av3 + ^ r -
Again recycle until suitable convergence is obtained and then go to the next above seg-
ment, etc.
6. The ultimate pile load (on top segment) is obtained as
Pu = P\ = Pp +^LiPiT1
We can see this is Eq. (16-5a) using the skin resistance given by Eq. (16-10) where we
define ASi = Ltpi and fs = T(.

Obtain an estimate of pile settlement or vertical top movement A// as
AH = ^ A y 1 -
i.e., simply sum the displacements of the several pile segments (the point displacement is
included in the lowest segment).
The shear versus pile slip curves of Fig. 16-18c are sometimes called t-z curves (t =
tau = symbol sometimes used for shear stress s and z = slip of pile shaft with respect to
adjacent soil). Kraft et al. (1981) proposed a semitheoretical procedure for obtaining the t-z
curves. The procedure is best described as semitheoretical since the method is substantially
theoretical yet, when it is reduced to the equation for curve development, it requires these
assumptions:

a. Shear stress at pile-soil interface
b. G' the soil shear modulus (or somehow measuring it in situ)
c. An empirical parameter Rf
d. An estimate of peak shear stress (smax)
e. An estimate of the radius of influence rm over which the shear stress ranges from a maxi-
mum at the pile shaft to zero at rm from the pile


This number of assumptions is rather large; however, if one has pile tests that can be
used and the method has been programmed, one can by trial obtain good agreement between
predicted and measured values for the pile test under consideration.
Load test results are highly site-specific in the sense they are pile responses only for the
pile in that location—and subject to interpretation. For this reason it is suggested that in the
practical situation if we are able to obtain three or four load-transfer curve profiles we can
then construct two or more trial shear transfer curves and use the simpler procedure outlined
in Fig. 16-18.

16-14 TENSION PILES—PILES FOR RESISTING UPLIFT
Tension piles may be used beneath buildings to resist uplift from hydrostatic pressure. They
also may be used to support structures over expansive soils. Overturning caused by wind, ice
loads, and broken wires may produce large tension forces for power transmission towers. In
this type of situation the piles or piers supporting the tower legs must be designed for both
compressive and tension forces. In all these cases a static pile analysis can be used to obtain
the ultimate tension resistance Ptu from Eq. (16-5&), slightly modified as
Ptu = X P s i + ^pb + W (16"25>
where X ^*si = skin resistance from the several strata over the embedment depth L and is
computed as
Psi = Asfs
fs = ca + qK tan 8
As = shaft perimeter X AL
^pb = pullout capacity from base enlargement (bell); may also be from suction
but suction is usually transient
W = total weight of pile or drilled pier/caisson

The adhesion ca is some fraction of the cohesion, q is the effective overburden pressure
to middepth of element AL, and K is a lateral earth-pressure coefficient. The large majority
of tension piles/piers are straight shafts, so the term Pp b is zero and the principal resistance
to pullout is skin resistance and the shaft weight. For driven metal and precast concrete piles
the same K for compression and tension would seem appropriate—or possibly with a slight
reduction to account for particle orientation during driving and residual stresses. A value of
K larger than K0 should be appropriate in sand since there is some volume displacement. The
API (1984) suggests K = 0.8 for tension (and compression) piles in sand for low-volume
displacement piles and K = 1 for displacement piles. For piles driven in clay one may use
the same methods as for compression piles (a, A, /3 methods).
For short drilled shafts (maximum depth = 5-6 m) that are filled with concrete, as com-
monly used for electric transmission tower bases and similar, we should look at the shaft
diameter. The following is suggested [based on the author's analysis of a number of cases—
the latest being Ismael et al. (1994) where Kme3iS was 1.45, and ^computed was 1.46] for piles
in uncemented sand:


K = Shaft diameter, mm
Ka D < 300 (12 in.)
\{Ka + K0) 300 < D < 600
\{Ka + K0 + Kp) D> 600 (or any D for slump > 70 mm)

In cemented sands you should try to ascertain the cohesion intercept and use a perimeter X
cohesion X L term. If this is not practical you might consider using about 0.8 to 0.9Kp.
The data base for this table includes tension tests on cast-in-place concrete piles ranging
from 150 to 1066 mm (6 to 42 in.) in diameter. The rationale for these K values is that, with the
smaller-diameter piles, arching in the wet concrete does not develop much lateral pressure
against the shaft soil, whereas the larger-diameter shafts (greater than 600 mm) allow full
lateral pressure from the wet concrete to develop so that a relatively high interface pressure
is obtained.

16-15 LATERALLY LOADED PILES
Piles in groups are often subject to both axial and lateral loads. Designers into the mid-1960s
usually assumed piles could carry only axial loads; lateral loads were carried by batter piles,
where the lateral load was a component of the axial load in those piles. Graphical methods
were used to find the individual pile loads in a group, and the resulting force polygon could
close only if there were batter piles for the lateral loads.
Sign posts, power poles, and many marine pilings represented a large class of partially
embedded piles subject to lateral loads that tended to be designed as "laterally loaded poles."
Current practice (or at least in this textbook) considers the full range of slender vertical (or
battered) laterally loaded structural members, fully or partially embedded in the ground, as
laterally loaded piles.
A large number of load tests have fully validated that vertical piles can carry lateral loads
via shear, bending, and lateral soil resistance rather than as axially loaded members. It is also
common to use superposition to compute pile stresses when both axial and lateral loads are
present. Bowles (1974a) produced a computer program to analyze pile stresses when both
lateral and axial loads were present [including the P — A effect (see Fig. 16-21)] and for
the general case of a pile fully or partially embedded and battered. This analysis is beyond
the scope of this text, partly because it requires load-transfer curves of the type shown in
Fig. 16-18Z?, which are almost never available. Therefore, the conventional analysis for a
laterally loaded pile, fully or partly embedded, with no axial load is the type considered in
the following paragraphs.
Early attempts to analyze a laterally loaded pile used the finite-difference method (FDM),
as described by Howe (1955), Matlock and Reese (1960), and Bowles in the first edition of
this text (1968).
Matlock and Reese (ca. 1956) used the FDM to obtain a series of nondimensional curves
so that a user could enter the appropriate curve with the given lateral load and estimate the
ground-line deflection and maximum bending moment in the pile shaft. Later Matlock and
Reese (1960) extended the earlier curves to include selected variations of soil modulus with
depth.

Previous Page


Although the nondimensional curves of Matlock and Reese were widely used, the au-
thor has never recommended their use. A pile foundation is costly, and computers have been
available—together with computer programs—for this type of analysis since at least 1960.
That is, better tools are now available for these analyses.

THE p-y METHOD. The initial work on the FDM lateral pile solution [see McClelland and
Focht (1958)] involved using node springs p and lateral node displacements y, so that users
of this method began calling it the "p-y method." Work continued on this FDM computer
program to allow use of different soil node springs along the pile shaft—each node having its
own p-y curve [see Reese (1977)]. Since p-y curves were stated by their author to represent
a line loading q (in units of kip/ft, which is also the unit of a soil spring), user confusion and
uncertainty of what they represent has developed. This uncertainty has not been helped by
the practice of actually using the p part of the p-y curve as a node spring but with a 1-ft node
spacing so that it is difficult to identify exactly how/? is to be interpreted. The product of node
spring and node displacement y gives p • y = a node force similar to spring forces computed
in the more recognizable form of force = K • X.
The data to produce a/?-y curve are usually obtained from empirical equations developed
from lateral load tests in the southwestern United States along the Gulf Coast. In theory, one
obtains a p-y curve for each node along the pile shaft. In practice, where a lateral load test
is back-computed to obtain these curves, a single curve is about all that one can develop that
has any real validity since the only known deflections are at or above the ground line unless
a hollow-pipe pile is used with telltale devices installed. If the node deflection is not known,
a p-y curve can be developed with a computer, but it will only be an approximation.
The FDM is not easy to program since the end and interior difference equations are not
the same; however, by using 1-ft elements, interior equations can be used for the ends with
little error. The equations for the pile head will also depend on whether it is free or either
translation and/or rotation is restrained. Other difficulties are encountered if the pile section
is not constant, and soil stratification or other considerations suggest use of variable length
segments. Of course, one can account for all these factors. When using 1-ft segments, just
shift the critical point: The maximum shift (or error) would only be 0.5 ft.
The FDM matrix is of size NxN, where TV = number of nodes. This matrix size and
a large node spacing were advantages on early computers (of the late 1950s) with limited
memory; however, it was quickly found that closer node spacings (and increases in AO pro-
duced better pile design data. For example, it is often useful to have a close node spacing in
about the upper one-third of a pile.
The FDM would require all nodes to have equal spacing. For a 0.3-m spacing on a 36-m
pile, 121 nodes would be required for a matrix of size NXN = 14 641 words or 58.6 kbytes
(4 bytes/word in single precision). This size would probably require double precision, so the
matrix would then use 117 kbytes.

THE FEM LATERAL PILE/PIER ANALYSIS. The author initially used the FDM for lateral
piles (see first edition of this text for a program); however, it soon became apparent that
the FEM offered a significant improvement. Using the beam element requires 2 degrees of
freedom per node, but the matrix is always symmetrical and can be banded into an array of
size
2 X number of nodes X Bandwidth


This array is always 2 X NNODES X 4, thus, a pile with 100 nodes would have a stiffness
matrix of 2 X 100 X 4 = 800 words. This is 3200 bytes or 3.2k of memory and in double
precision only requires 6.4k bytes.
One advantage of the FEM over the FDM is the FEM has both node translation and ro-
tation, whereas the FDM only has translation. The elastic curve is somewhat better defined
using both translation and rotation.
Another advantage is that the element lengths, widths, and moments of inertia can vary
with only slightly extra input effort. One can even use composite piles. The pile modulus
of elasticity is usually input as a constant since most piles are of a single material, but it is
trivial to modify the moment of inertia for a composite section so that the program computes
the El/L value correctly. This value is determined by computing a modified moment of inertia
Im as in Eq. (13-4).
When using variable element lengths it is suggested that one should try to keep the ratio
of adjacent element lengths (longest/shortest) < 3 or 4.
A major advantage of the FEM is the way in which one can specify boundary cases (nodes
with either zero rotation or translation) and lateral loads. The FDM usually requires the load
and boundary points be pre-identified; the FEM allows any node to be used as a load point or
to have known translation or rotation—the known value is usually 0.0 but can be nonzero as
well.
A final advantage is that the FEM for a lateral pile program can be used for a lateral pier
(piles with a larger cross section) or beam-on-elastic-foundation design. It is only necessary
to input several additional control parameters so the program knows what type of problem is
to be solved. Thus, one only has to learn to use one fairly simple program in order to solve sev-
eral classes of problems. Your sheet-pile program FADSPABW (B-9) is a special case of this
method. It was separately written, although several subroutines are the same, because there
are special features involved in sheet-pile design. These additional considerations would in-
troduce unnecessary complexity into a program for lateral piles so that it would be a little
more difficult to use. Many consider it difficult in any case to use a program written by some-
one else, so the author's philosophy has been to limit what a program does so that it is easier
to use.
Refer to Sec. 9-8 for the derivation of the stiffness matrix and other matrices for the beam-
on-elastic foundation and also used for the lateral pile. The only difference is that the beam-
on-elastic foundation is rotated 90° clockwise for the lateral pile P-X coding and the end
springs are not doubled (see Fig. 16-19). You must know how the finite-element model is
coded and how the element force orientations (direction of arrowheads on force, moment,
and rotation vectors) are specified either to order the input loads or to interpret the output
element moments and node displacements.

USING THE FEM COMPUTER PROGRAM. The general approach to setting up an FEM
model for using your diskette program FADBEMLP (B-5) to analyze lateral piles is this:

1. Divide the pile into a convenient number of elements (or segments) as in Fig. 16-19. From
experience it has been found that the top third of the embedment depth is usually critical
for moments and displacements, so use shorter element lengths in this region. Avoid very
short elements adjacent to long elements; place nodes at pile cross-sectional changes, at
soil strata changes, and where forces or boundary conditions are being applied. Generally
10 to 15 elements are adequate, with 4 to 8 in the upper third of the embedded shaft length.


Figure 16-19 Laterally loaded pile using finite elements. Typical loadings shown in (a) and (b). Note that elements
do not have to be same size or length. Generally use short elements near ground surface and longer elements near
pile point where moments are less critical.
2. Partially embedded piles are readily analyzed by using JTSOIL equal to the node where
soil starts (same as for sheet-pile wall). Use JTSOIL = 1 if ground line is at first pile node.
3. Identify any nodes with zero translation and/or rotation. NZX = number of Xs of zero dis-
placement. Use element coding to identify those X values that are input using NXZERO(I).
4. Make some estimate of the modulus of subgrade reaction and its depth variation (AS, BS,
EXPO). Note that either AS or BS can be zero; EXPO = 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, or 1.5 may be
appropriate; EXPO is the exponent of Zn. You can also estimate a Z^-value [and XMAX(I)]
for each node to input similar to the sheet-pile program.
5. Back-compute lateral load test data, if they are available, for the best estimate of ks. One
should not try to back-compute an exact fit since site variability and changes in pile type
(pipe versus HP) preclude the existence of a unique value of ks. The large number of pile
tests reported by Alizadeh and Davisson (1970) clearly shows that great refinement in
back computations is not required. One should, however, use in a load test the lateral load
that is closest to the working load for best results.
WHAT TO USE FOR THE MODULUS OF SUBGRADE REACTION ks.5 The modulus of
subgrade reaction is seldom measured in a lateral loaded pile test. Instead, loads and deflec-

s is used in the same way as for the beam-on-elastic foundation,
it is a vertical value here. The type (vertical or horizontal) is identified to the user by the context of usage.

tions are usually obtained as well as, sometimes, bending moments in the top 1 to 3 m of
the embedded pile. From these one might work back using one's favorite equation for lateral
modulus (or whatever) and obtain values to substantiate the design for that site.
Node values (or an equation for node values) of ks are required in the FEM solution for
lateral piles. Equation (9-10), given in Chap. 9 and used in Chap. 13, can also be used here.
For convenience the equation is repeated here:
^ = A , + BsZn (9-10)
If there is concern that the ks profile does not increase without bound use Bs = 0 or use
Bs in one of the following forms:
Bs ( | j = ^ Z " = B'sZn (now input B's for B5)
or use B5(Z)" where n < 1 (but not < 0)

where Z = current depth from ground surface to any node
D = total pile length below ground

The form of Eq. (9-10) for ks just presented is preprogrammed into program FADBEMLP
(B-5) on your diskette together with the means to reduce the ground line node and next lower
node ks (FACl, FAC2 as for your sheet-pile program). You can also input values for the
individual nodes since the soil is often stratified and the only means of estimating ks is from
SPT or CPT data. In this latter case you would adjust the ground line ks before input, then
input FACl = FAC2 = 1.0.
The program then computes node springs based on the area Ac contributing to the node,
as in the following example:

Example 16-9. Compute the first four node springs for the pile shown in Fig. El 6-9. The soil
modulus is ks = 100 + 50Z05. From the ks profile and using the average end area formula:

Summary,

,etc.


Example 16-9 illustrates a basic difference between this and the sheet-pile program. The
sheet-pile section is of constant width whereas a pile can (and the pier or beam-on-elastic
foundation often does) have elements of different width.
This program does not allow as many forms of Eq. (9-10) as in FADSPABW; however,
clever adjustment of the BS term and being able to input node values are deemed sufficient
for any cases that are likely to be encountered.
In addition to the program computing soil springs, you can input ks = 0 so all the springs
are computed as Ki = 0 and then input a select few to model structures other than lateral piles.
Offshore drilling platforms and the like are often mounted on long piles embedded in the soil
below the water surface. The drilling platform attaches to the pile top and often at several
other points down the pile and above the water line. These attachments may be modeled as
springs of the AE/L type. Treating these as springs gives a partially embedded pile model—
with possibly a fixed top and with intermediate nonsoil springs and/or node loads—with the
base laterally supported by an elastic foundation (the soil).
Since the pile flexural stiffness EI is several orders of magnitude larger than that of the
soil, the specific value(s) of ks are not nearly so important as their being in the range of 50 to
about 200 percent of correct. You find this comparison by making trial executions using a Ic5,
then doubling it and halving it, and observing that the output moments (and shears) do not
vary much. The most troublesome piece of data you discover is that the ground line displace-
ment is heavily dependent on what is used for ks. What is necessary is to use a pile stiff enough

and keep the lateral load small enough that any computed (or actual) lateral displacement is
tolerable.
A number of persons do not like to use the modulus of subgrade reaction for anything—
beams, mats or lateral piles. Generally they have some mathematical model that purportedly
works for them and that they would like for others to adopt. In spite of this the ks concept
has remained popular—partly because of its simplicity; partly because (if properly used) it
gives answers at least as good as some of the more esoteric methods; and, most importantly,
because A^ is about as easy to estimate as it is to estimate the stress-strain modulus Es and
Poisson's ratio /JL.

WHAT PILE SECTION TO USE. It is usual to use the moment of inertia / of the actual pile
section for both HP and other piles such as timber and concrete. For reinforced concrete piles,
there is the possibility of the section cracking. The moment of inertia / of a cracked section
is less than that of the uncracked section, so the first step in cracked section analysis is to
recompute / based on a solid transformed section, as this may be adequate.
It is suggested that it is seldom necessary to allow for section cracking. First, one should
not design a pile for a lateral load so large that the tension stresses from the moment produce
cracking—instead, increase the pile cross section or the number of piles. Alternatively, use
steel or prestressed concrete piles.
The possibility of concrete pile cracking under lateral load is most likely to occur when par-
tially embedded piles are used. The unsupported length above the ground line may undergo
lateral displacements sufficiently large that the section cracks from the resulting mtfment-
induced tension stresses. The unsupported pile length must be treated similarly to an unsup-
ported column for the structural design, so a larger cross section may be required—at least in
the upper portion of the pile.

16-15.1 Empirical Equations for Estimating ks
Where pile-load tests are not available, some value of ks that is not totally unrealistic must
be estimated, one hopes in the range between ± 50 and ± 200 percent6 of the correct value.
The following equations can be used to make reasonable estimates for the lateral modulus of
subgrade reaction.
An approximation proposed by the author is to double Eq. (9-9) since the soil surrounds
the pile, producing a considerable side shear resistance. For input you obtain ASf Bs values
and multiply by two. Using the bearing-capacity components of Eq. (13-1) to give the needed
parts of Eq. (9-9), we have
As = AS = C(cNc + 0.5yBpNy)
BsZn = BS*(Z~N) = C(yNqZ])
where C = 40 for SI, 12 for Fps. It was also suggested that the following values could be
used, depending on the actual lateral displacement:

6Two hundred percent is double the true value, and 50 percent is one-half the true value.

16-15.2 Size and Shape Factors
The idea of doubling the lateral modulus was to account for side shear developed as the
pile shaft moves laterally under load, both bearing against the soil in front and shearing the
soil on parts of the sides as qualitatively illustrated in Fig. 16-20. Clearly, for piles with a
small projected D or B, the side shear would probably be close to the face bearing (consisting
of 1.0 for face +2 X 0.5 for two sides = 2.0). This statement would not be true for larger
D or B values. The side shear has some limiting value after which the front provides the
load resistance. Without substantiating data, let us assume this ratio, two side shears to one
face, of 1:1 reaches its limit at B = D = 0.457 m (18 in.). If this is the case then the size
factor multiplier (or ratio) Cm should for single piles be about as follows (the 1.0 is the face
contribution):

For Ratio, Cm

Lateral loads of both Px and Py

( . _ - \0.75

> 1.5

D, mm J
use 1.0 + 0.25 for D > 1200mm

You should keep the foregoing contributing factors in mind, for they will be used later where
the face and side contributions may not be 1.0 and 0.5, respectively.
Now with Cw, rewrite Eq. (13-1) as used in Sec. 16-15.1 to read
As = AS = CmC(cNc + 0.5yBpNy)}
BsZn = BS * Z~N = CmC(yNqZn) J
It is also suggested that the BS term should use an exponent n that is on the order of 0.4
to 0.6 so that ks does not increase without bound with depth.
Research by the author by back-computing ks from piles in cohesionless soils at the same
site indicates that Eq. (9-10) should be further rewritten to read
A8 = AS = FwlCmC(cNc + 0.5y BpN7)] (\6-26a)
BsZn = BS * Z^N = Fw2CmC(yNqZn) J
where Fw\, Fw2 = 1-0 for square and HP piles (reference modulus)
Fw\ = 1.3 to 1.7; FW2 = 2.0 to 4.4 for round piles


One probably should apply the Ft factors only to the face term (not side shear) for round
piles. Whether these shape factors actually result from a different soil response for round
piles or are due to erroneous reported data from neglecting the distortion of the hollow pipe
(laterally into an oblate shape) under lateral load is not known at this time. Gleser (1983) and
others have observed that the response of a round pile is different from that of a square or
HP pile, in general agreement with the foregoing except in a case where a comparison of a
100-mm HP pile to a 180-mm diameter pipe pile was claimed not to produce any noticeable
difference.

Size and projection widths would make it very difficult to note any differences in this
case, particularly if the pipe wall thickness was such that the diameter did not tend to oblate
(flatten).

USING THE GIVEN BEARING CAPACITY. If we have only the allowable bearing pressure
qa, we can use Eq. (16-26) as follows (but may neglect the Nq term):
ks = FH,,i X SF X CmC Xqa + Fw>2 X CmCyZnNq (16-26/?)
where SF = safety factor used to obtain qa (usually 3 for clay; 2 for cohesionless soil)
Nq = value from Table 4-4 or from Eq. (16-7) or (16-7J)
n = exponent as previously defined; 1 is probably too large so use about 0.4 to 0.6
so ks does not increase too much with depth

If you use either Eq. (16-26) or (16-26a) you should plot ks for the pile depth using several
values of exponent n to make a best selection.
It has been found that the use of Eq. (16-26) produces values within the middle to upper
range of values obtained by other methods.
If we take qa = qu (unconfined compression test) and omit the Nq term in Eq. (\6-26a),
the value of ks in Fps units for a pile of unknown B is
ks = Cm X 12 X SF X qu = 2 X 3 X 12 X qu = 12qu
Davisson and Robinson (1965) suggested a value of ks ~ 67 su, which was about half of 12qu.
Later Robinson (1978) found that 61 su was about half the value of ks indicated by a series of
lateral load tests [that is, 12qu (or 24Oqu, kPa) was about the correct value].
The API (1984) suggests that the lateral bearing capacity for soft clay (c < 50 kPa) be
limited to 9c and for stiff clay from 8c to 12c [see Gazioglu and O'Neill (1985) for detailed
discussion]. In soft clay this bearing capacity would give, according to Eq. (16-26a), the value
ks = Cm(40)(9c) = 360Cmc (kN/m3)
which does not appear unreasonable.
You may indirectly obtain ks from the following type of in situ tests:

a. Borehole pressuremeter tests where Epm = pressuremeter modulus

*, = ^ 1 (16-27)
Bp
For cohesionless soils [see Chen (1978)]:

(16-27a)

(16-276)

And for cohesive soils:


where Ed = dilatometer modulus, kPa or ksf
Fp = pile shape factor: 1.5 to 4.0 for round piles; 1.0 for HP or square piles

For these values of ks you would compute values as close to your pile nodes as possible
and input the several node values, not just a single value for the full depth.
The stress-strain modulus Es can be used in Eq. (16-31) following [or Vesic's Eq. (9-6),
given earlier] to compute ks. Estimate Es from your equation or method or one of the follow-
ing:

a. Triaxial tests and using the secant modulus Es between 0 and 0.25 to 0.5 of the peak
deviator stress. The initial tangent modulus may also be used. Do not use a plane strain
Es.
b. The standard penetration test [see Yoshida and Yoshinaka (1972)] to obtain
Es = 650N kPa (16-29)
This equation has a maximum error of about 100 percent with an average error of close
to ± 20 percent. Assume that N in Eq. (16-29) is NJO (see under donut hammer of Table
3-3).
For CPT data convert to equivalent SPT TV and use Eq. (16-29).
c. Use consolidation test data to obtain mv to compute the stress-strain modulus by combining
Eqs. (2-43) and Eq. (J) of Sec. 2-14 and noting
A// _ 1

to obtain

Es = 3 { 1 - 2 ^ (16-30)
mv
Any of these three values of Es can be used to compute ks in clay using any of the following
three equations cited by Pyke and Beikae (1983):
0.48 to 0.90^,
ks = - (a)

where 0.48 is for HP piles; 0.9 for round piles (i.e., a shape factor Fw\ ~ 2);
K - ^ W
and for sands

(C)

b. Flat dilatometer tests:

(16-28)


where in Eq. (c) Es = triaxial test value at about 6—0.01. You may also use these stress-
strain moduli values in the following equation [Glick (1948)] to obtain a modified A^ that is
then used in Eq. (16-32):
" • ( u ^ - W M V U - u m i <u"itsofE') <1M1)
where Lp = pile length, m or ft
B = pile width, m or ft

After computing k's, convert it to the usual ks using the following:

ks = % (16-32)
D
Since this value of k's has the same meaning as the Vesic value given by Eq. (9-6), we can
use that equation with the following suggested modification:
k 7n
ks = - ^ - (l6-32a)
The zn term is suggested to allow some controlled increase in ks with depth.
The NAFAC Design Manual DM7.2 (1982) suggests the following:

k5 = ^ (16-33)
where / = factor from following table, kN/m3 or k/ft3
D = pile diameter or width, m or ft
z = depth; m or ft gives ks = O at ground surface and a large value for long piles at
the tips. A better result might be had using (z/D)n where n ranges from about
0.4 to 0.7.

Table 16-4 gives ranges of ks for several soils, which are intended as a guide for probable
values using more precise methods—or at least using the site soil for guidance. They should
be taken as reasonably representative of the As + Bs terms at a depth from about 3 to 6 m and
for pile diameters or widths under 500 mm.

16-15.3 Nonlinear Effects
It is well known that doubling the load on a lateral pile usually more than doubles the lateral
displacement and increases the bending moment. The moment increase results from both the
increase in Sh and the greater depth in which lateral displacements occur. Both of these effects
result from nonlinear soil behavior idealized by the curve shown in Fig. 2-43c, particularly at
higher stress levels a that result from larger lateral loads. Usually the lateral displacements
in the load range of interest are in that part of the a-8 curve that is approximately linear.
In the curve of Fig. 2-43c the modulus of subgrade reaction is taken as a "secant" line
from the origin through some convenient stress value a. Ideally one should have a curve
such as this for each node point (see Fig. E13-le) for a lateral pile. Then, as a displacement
is computed one would enter the curve, obtain a revised secant modulus ks, and recompute
the displacements until the 5^ value used = S^ value obtained.
This approach is seldom practical since these curves are difficult to obtain—usually a pipe
pile must be used for the test so that lateral measurements can be taken at nodes below the
ground line. A pipe pile, however, has a shape factor, so the results are not directly usable for
other pile shapes.
Most lateral piles are designed on the basis of using penetration testing of some kind,
supplemented with unconfined compression data if the soil is cohesive. For these cases the
two-branch nonlinear model proposed by the author (see Fig. 9-9c) will generally be ade-
quate.
The program FADBEMLP on your diskette allows you to model the two-branch nonlinear
node displacement curve for the soil as you did in program FADSPABW. That is, you can
input the maximum linear displacement at each node as XMAX(I) and activate a nonlin-
ear check using the control parameter NONLIN > 0. Here a negative displacement is not a
soil separation, but rather the pile has deflected forward such that the elastic line has produced


a displacement at a lower node against the soil behind the pile. An extensive discussion
of XMAX(I) was given in Chap. 13 that will not be repeated here except to note that the
nonlinear check is |X(I)| < XMAX(I).

CYCLIC LOADING. The ks for cyclic loading should be reduced from 10 to 50 percent of
that for static loading. The amount of reduction depends heavily on the displacements during
the first and subsequent cycles.
Quasi-dynamic analysis of offshore piles subject to wave forces can be obtained by apply-
ing the instant wave force on the nodes in the water zone for several closely spaced discrete
time intervals.

DISPLACEMENTS FROM SOIL CREEP. Lateral displacement from long-term loading, pro-
ducing secondary consolidation or creep, has not been much addressed for lateral piles. Kup-
pusamy and Buslov (1987) gave some suggestions; however, the parameters needed for the
necessary equations are difficult to obtain. Although one could consult that reference, their
equations are little better than simply suggesting that, if the lateral load is kept under 50 per-
cent of the ultimate, the creep displacement for sand after several years is not likely to exceed
10 percent of the initial lateral displacement.
For clay, the creep will depend on whether it is organic or inorganic. The creep displace-
ment may be as much as the initial displacement for an organic clay but only about 15 to 20
percent for an inorganic one. One might compute a lateral influence depth of approximately
5 X projected width of pile/pier = Hf and use Eq. (2-49) for a numerical estimate if you
have a secondary compression coefficient Ca.
Laterally loaded piles in permafrost also undergo creep. Here the creep depends on the tem-
perature, quantity and type of ice, and the lateral pressure, generally expressed as a "creep"
parameter. Neukirchner (1987) claims to have a reasonable solution, but the creep parameter
is so elusive that there is substantial uncertainty in any permafrost creep estimate.
When lateral piles undergo creep, the effect is to increase the lateral displacement and
bending moment. The goal is an estimate of the final lateral displacement and bending mo-
ment. The bending moment might be obtained in any situation where creep is involved by
simply measuring the displacements and, using the current lateral displacement as the spec-
ified displacement in program FADBEMLP, computing the moment produced by that dis-
placement.
Alternatively since creep decreases approximately logarithmically it might be obtained
by plotting the displacement at several time intervals (long enough to be meaningful) and
numerically integrating the curve to find the anticipated total lateral displacement for input
so as to compute the lateral pile bending moments.

16-15.4 Including the P-A Effect
The P-A effect can be included for lateral piles (refer to Fig. 16-21) in a straightforward
manner as follows:

1. Draw the partially embedded pile to rough scale, code the nodes, and locate the node
JTSOIL. We will use JTSOIL as the reference node.
2. Make an execution of the data with the horizontal force Ph located at the correct node
above JTSOIL. This will generally be at the top of the pile where the vertical load Pv also

acts. Until you become familiar with program FADBEMLP you should use the pile and
load geometry which corresponds to Fig. 16-21.
3. Inspect the output, and at the top node where Pv acts there will be a lateral displacement
(let us use, say, A = 0.40 m and a vertical force Pv = 60 kN). From the lateral displace-
ment, which is with respect to the original position of node JTSOIL, a P - A moment can
be computed (see inset of Fig. 16-21) of 60 X 0.40 = 24 kN-m.
4. Make a copy of the original data and change NNZP from 1 (for the horizontal force only)
to 2 to include both the original horizontal force and the P - A moment just computed of 24
kN- m. If we assume JTSOIL = 11, the moment NP location is 2 X 11 - 1 = 21.
5. In the data file you can see the horizontal load and its NP number. Just below, enter 21 and
the moment value of 24. Note from the inset, however, that the moment has a negative
sign. The two load matrix entries would now read

6. Now execute this data set (if the sign is correct the top node displacement A will slightly
increase). Obtain the displacements, and if the previous Ap - Acurrent — some convergence
(not in program but decided by the user), say, 0.005 m or less, stop. Otherwise continue
to compute a new P-A moment and recycle.

Note that the second data set has two changes initially: (1) to increase NNZP by 1 and (2)
to input the P-A moment. After this, the only change to that second data set is to reinput the
new P-A moment until the problem converges.
The node JTSOIL will probably move laterally also, and the most critical P-A moment is
not the difference between the top node and node JTSOIL but between the top node and some
node farther down that does not move laterally. You could, of course, put the P-A moment
at this location, but the foregoing suggested solution is generally adequate. You can also use
the difference between the top translation and the computed translation at node JTSOIL, but
this is less conservative.

16-15.5 Lateral Piles on Slopes
Laterally loaded piles are frequently sited on slopes, for example, power poles and bridge
foundations. It is suggested that the same procedure be used to reduce the lateral ks val-
ues as was used for the sheet-pile wall case. That is, use program WEDGE or FFACTOR to

compute the passive force (or coefficient Kp) case for the horizontal ground line and for the
actual ground slope and use the ratio RF as in Eq. (13-3). Because the side shear part from
factor Cm is not required to be reduced, you should apply the slope ratio RF only to the face
(or bearing) part of &s. For example, compute ks = 2000 based on using Cm = 2; RF = 0.6.
This calculation gives ks\ = 2000/Cm = 1000 = ks2. The revised ks = ks2 + RF X ^1 =
1000 + 0.6 x 1000 = 1600.

16-15.6 Battered Piles
The ks for battered piles has not been addressed much in the literature. In the absence of
substantiating data the author suggests (see Fig. 16-22^) the following:

1. Compute the Coulomb passive earth pressure coefficient Kp for a vertical wall (a = 90°),
including any slope angle /3. A lateral pile is a "passive" earth-pressure case but requires
including side shear effects since the Coulomb case is one of plane strain.
2. Next draw the battered pile and place a perpendicular load on the pile with the (+) di-
rection as shown on Fig. 16-22a. The perpendicular load direction should correspond to
that used to establish the batter direction [will be either (+) or (-)]. Draw a horizontal
component line as, say, Px as shown.
3. Now measure (or compute) the batter angle a. It is counterclockwise from a horizontal
line at the pile tip for the (+) load perpendicular; it is clockwise for a (-) load perpendic-
ular. For the (+) perpendicular shown on Fig. \6-22a we have a > 90° if the horizontal
component is below and a < 90° if the horizontal component is above the perpendicular.
4. Compute a Coulomb passive pressure coefficient Kpb for the applicable batter angle a.
Use program FFACTOR. You probably should include a pile-to-soil friction angle 8.

5. Compute a revised ks as

ks = 11.0 x ^ U (2 x 0.5)
This calculation should give the expected result of a larger ks for a > 90° and a smaller
&5 for a < 90° for the (+) case shown on Fig. 16-22a.

Note: We only adjust the face or bearing part of ks because the side shear should be about
the same for either a vertical or a battered pile.

16-15.7 Adjusting ks for Spacing
It is generally accepted that there is a reduction in the lateral subgrade modulus ks when piles
are closely spaced. Poulos (1979) suggested using factors from curves developed using an
elastic analysis of pile-soil interaction (i.e., Es, /x,), which are then combined to give a group
factor. This method does not seem to be used much at present.
The following method (refer to Fig. 16-22&) is suggested as an easy-to-visualize alternative
to obtain the lateral modulus for individual piles in a group:

1. Referring to the Boussinesq pressure bulb (Fig. 5-4) beneath a rectangular footing, we
see that at a D/B > 6 the pressure increase on the soil is negligible. So, using a clear
pile spacing s' for depth D and pile projected width for B, we can say that if s'/B > 6 no
adjustment in ks is necessary.
2. For spacings of s'/B < 6 use Fig. 5-4 ("Continuous") and multiply the face bearing term
by (1.0 - interpolated pressure intensity factor). For example at s'/B = 2, we obtain 0.29,
and the face term is 1.0 X (1.0 - 0.29) = 0.71 (here 0.29, or 29 percent, of the pressure
is carried by the front pile). This is the face factor contribution to Cm (= 2 sides + face
= (2 X 0.5)+ 0.71 = 1.71).
3. For the side shear factor contribution to Cm we have two considerations:
a. Location (corner, front, side, interior, or rear)
b. What reduction factor (if any) to use
Clearly for side and corner piles one side is not affected by any adjacent pile so for those
we have some interior side interaction factor ^ + an exterior factor of 0.5. For front, interior,
and rear piles we have a side interaction factor of 2W.
One option is to consider that any pile insertion increases the lateral pressure so that the
use of ^ = 0.5 is adequate. Another option is to consider that enough remolding takes place
that the soil is in a residual stress state and to reduce the 0.5 side factor to

Undisturbed strength
16-15.8 Estimating Required Length
of a Laterally Loaded Pile
The required length of a laterally loaded pile has not been directly addressed in the literature.
Obviously, it should be long enough to provide lateral stability, and if there is an axial load,
the pile must be long enough to develop the required axial capacity.


We can obtain the required pile embedment length for lateral stability (it was previously
noted that usually the upper one-third of the pile actively resists the lateral loads) as follows:

1. Compute the embedment length required for any axial load. If there is no axial load ini-
tially, try some reasonable length, say, L'.
2. Use computer program B-5 with your lateral load Py1 and obtain a set of output.
3. Inspect the horizontal displacement 8hp at the pile base (or point). If the absolute value
of Shp ~ 0.0, the pile length is adequate. If \Shp\ > 0.0, you have to decide whether the
length is adequate, since this amount of displacement may be indicative of a toe kickout
(lateral soil failure). Also check that the active (zone of significant bending moment) depth
is approximately L'/3. Now do two other checks:
a. Depending on how you initialized L\ you may want to increase it by 20 to 30 percent
to allow for a modest stability number (SF).
b. Make two additional program executions using 1/2 and 2 times the initial value of
lateral subgrade modulus ks. If both these executions give 8hP ~ 0.0, you have an
adequate pile embedment depth L'. If 8hp > 0.0 (particularly for the ks/2 case), you
probably should increase L'.
If you increase L' based on either (a) or (ft), you should recycle to step 2. When you find
an V value that satisfies the toe-movement criteria, you have a suitable pile embedment
depth. The total pile length is then Lp = V + pile length above soil line.

16-15.9 Pile Constants for Pile Group Analyses
The lateral pile program B-5 can be used to obtain the pile constants needed for the group
analysis of Chap. 18. Figure 16-19 illustrates how the node displacements are specified in
order to obtain the required computer output. Figure E16-13c illustrates how the output is
plotted to obtain curve slopes that are the desired constants. The units of these constants
produce either shear springs (translation for P/8) or rotational springs (M/0). The specific
procedure for a given pile is outlined in Example 16-13 following. The general procedure is
(for either partially or fully embedded piles) to select one of the two axes and do the following:

1. Fix the pile head against translation [NZX = 1 and NXZERO(I) = 2 since
NP = 2 is the translation NP at node I]. Apply a series of moments for NP = 1 (or
only one moment if a linear model is assumed). The computer output gives the corre-
sponding rotations at node 1, which are plotted versus M. Also plot the unbalanced force
(required to restrain translation) versus M as in Fig. E16-13c curve A. The slopes of these
two curves are two of the required pile constants.
2. Fix the pile head against rotation [NZX = 1,NXZERO(I) = I]. Apply a series of lateral
loads for NP = 2 (or a single load if a linear model is assumed). The computer outputs
translations at node 1, which are plotted versus input load P. Also plot the "near" end
moment in element 1 (the rotation-fixed node) versus P. These two plots are shown in
Fig. E16-13c curve B. The slopes of these two curves are also two of the required pile
constants.
3. If the pile is round, the preceding two items complete the necessary computer usage since
either axis gives the same output. If the pile is rectangular or an HP pile, one set of data


(for four constants) uses the moment of inertia about the x axis and a second set (the other
four constants) uses the moment of inertia about the y axis.
4. Strictly, there will be a set of constants for each of the corner, side, front, interior, and rear
piles (including batter effects) in a pile group, although some of the constants may be the
same for several piles depending on the group geometry. The reason is that the lateral soil
modulus ks will be different for the several piles (although many analyses have been done
using a single ks and set of pile constants for the group). A single ks is used for Example
16-13 and for the group examples in Chap. 18 to save text space and make the examples
easier to follow.

16-16 LATERALLY LOADED PILE EXAMPLES
The following several examples will illustrate computing ks for a laterally loaded pile and
using your program FADBEMLP to analyze lateral piles.

Example 16-10.

Given, A soft silty clay with average qu = Al.5 kPa and, from a consolidation test, mv = 5.32 X
10"5 m2AN. An HP 310 X 174 pile (d = 324; b = 327 mm; and Ix = 394 X 10"6 m4) is to be
used.

Required. What is the lateral ks by Vesic's Eq. (9-6) and Bowles' method?

Solution.

a. Use Vesic's Eq. (9-6) and take /x = 0.45. We find

Es « 200su = \00qu = 100 X 50 = 5000 kPa
Use Es = 5300 kPa
Using Eq. (9-6) with Es = 5300; Epilc = 200 000 MPa; B = 327 mm (0.307 m), we obtain

* S - 2 X O 6 5 1 2 / ^ X E* . 1 3 i 2 / 5 3 0 a 0 x a 3 2 7 ^ 5300.0
ksB- 2X0.65 ^ - X 1 - ^ 5 - 1 . 3 V 200X394 X 1 - 0.45*
= 1.3 x 0.550 X 5300/0.798 = 4749 kPa
ks = 4749/0.327 = 14520ZnkN/m3 (slight rounding)
b. Using Bowles' method and qa = qu with an SF = 3, a square pile gives Fw>i = 1.0, and doubling
for side shear, Cm = 2.0. Then
ks = FWtX X 2 X C X SF X qu = 1 X 2 X 40 X 3 X 50 = 12000Zn kN/m3
Note that C has units of 1/m.
Check the API method where qu\t = 9c = 4.5qu.
ks = FWtX x 2 x C x qult = 1 x 2 x 40 x 4.5 x 50 = 18000Z" kN/m3
If qu is the average for the range of the embedment depth of the pile, one would use the exponent


What would you recommend for ks for this pile(s)? The author would be reluctant to use much
over 10 000Zn kN/m based on the range of the three computed values shown.
////

Example 16-11. Given the soil profile of Fig. E16-6 containing average blow counts for each 2.4
m (8 ft) of depth as follows: 10, 15, 20, and 25. Compute a reasonable equation in the form of
ks = AS + BS * Zn
Solution. Using Eq. (16-29) and converting the Af values given to NJO, we obtain ks at these points:

-1.2 650 X N = 650 X 10(55/70) = 5100 (rounding)
-3.6 650 X 15 X 0.786 = 7600
-6.0 650 X 20 X 0.786 = 10200
-8.4 650 X 25 X 0.786 = 12700

These values are used to plot a curve of Z versus ks, which is approximately linear. If we extend it
to Z = 0, the intercept is AS = 4000. With this value and at Z = 8.4 we solve
AS + BS X Z1 = 12700 = 4000 + BS X 8.4
BS = 1036 (rounded)
The resulting equation is
ks = 4000 + 1036Z
In using this equation we would want to use FACl and FAC2 on the first two nodes since sand
would have little lateral capacity at Z = 0.
////

Example 16-12. This and Example 16-13 require that you use program FADBEMLP on your
diskette. The data set for this example is EX1612.DTA. Its use illustrates using several load cases
in a single execution—four in this example.
Given. The pile-soil geometry shown in Fig. E16-12a, which is from a series of lateral pile tests
for a lock and dam on the Arkansas River in the mid-1960s. The approximate data can be found in
Alizadeh and Davisson (1970) in Fps units, but the author had access to one of the original reports
provided to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (who built the lock and dam). The 406-mm (16-in.)
diameter pile test was selected for this example. The test used four loads as given in the table on
Fig. E16-12a.
Solution.
Step 1. Divide the pile into a number of segments. The pile was loaded 0.03 m (0.1 ft) above the
ground surface, but this will be neglected. We will take the top two elements as 0.335 m and 0.3
m and increase the lengths to 0.6 for four elements, etc. as shown on the output sheet Fig. E16-
\2b. The pile moment of inertia was given in the report as 0.3489 X 10~3 m4 (838.2 in.4). The pipe
being steel, £piie = 200 000 MPa. The length was given as 16.12 m (52.8 ft). The width is the pipe
diameter, or 0.406 m.
Step 2. Estimate ks. Use Eq. (16-26a) with Cm = 2.0; and the shape factors FWt\ = 1.5 and Fw>2 =
3.2. Obtain from Table 4-4 Nq = 23.2 and Ny = 20.8; use no depth or shape factors.

Making substitutions (y' = 9.8 kN/m3), we obtain
ks = 80 x 1.5 x 0.5 x 9.9 x 0.406 x 20.8 + 8Ox 3.2 x 9.9 x 23.2Z1
ks = 5000 + 58 800Z1 (using minor rounding)
These values are input to the program (and shown on Fig. E16-12b). The modulus reduction factors
FACl, FAC2 = 1.0. For node 1 the lateral displacement 8h = 0.00817 m = 8.17 mm versus about
6.6 mm measured for the 140.1 kN load.
This output compares quite well both in displacements and maximum moment (and its location),
and this aside from the fact the lateral modulus was computed only one time using the foregoing
input. The results might be somewhat improved using an exponent of 0.4 or 0.6 instead of 0.5, but
this supposition is left as a reader exercise. Certainly the output is well within the scatter one would
expect in testing several piles at a site.
The file EX1612.DTA was edited to use only two load cases for text output; all four load cases
are in the file for reader use.
You have a plot file option in this program by which you can save data to a disk file for later
plotting using a CAD plotting program. The file contents are output to paper (but only if the plot

output to plot shear and moment diagrams by hand if you do not have a plotting program.

Example 16-13. This example illustrates how to obtain pile constants as required for the pile cap
analysis using computer program FAD3DPG (B-IO) or program B-28. For this analysis an HP360 X
174 is used with the required data of d = 361 mm; b = 378 mm; Ix = 0.5080 X 10"3 mA\Iy =
0.1840 X 10~3 m4. These and selected other data are shown in Fig. E16-13<2, including the element
lengths and number of nodes. The soil modulus is somewhat arbitrarily taken as
ks = 200 + 50Z0 5
partly to illustrate using an exponent less than 1.0. A spring taken as 0.9 X computed value is input
for the cases of translation but no rotation (the first node spring can be anything since it is not used
for the case of no translation but node rotation). The input of a spring here is to illustrate how it is
done.
To obtain four sets of pile constants we must make two executions with respect to each prin-
cipal axis of the pile. In one execution node 1 is fixed to allow rotation but no translation (data
set EX1613A.DTA); in the second execution the node is fixed to allow translation but no rotation
(EX1613B.DTA). You have this sample output set as Fig. E16-13Z?. Data sets EX1613C.DTA and
EX1613D.DTA are similar but with respect to the y axis.
From execution of all the data sets one can plot the Curves A and B of Fig. E16-13c. The loads
were somewhat arbitrarily chosen after making several trial runs using different values of ks so
that displacements and rotations would be large enough to produce easily identifiable data for the
textbook user.

16-17 BUCKLING OF FULLY AND PARTIALLY EMBEDDED
PILES AND POLES
The author, using a method presented by Wang (1967) for buckling of columns of variable
cross section, developed a procedure that can be used to obtain the buckling load for piles
either fully or partially embedded. The method is easier to use and considerably more ver-
satile, if a computer program such as B-26 is available, than either the methods of Davisson
and Robinson (1965) or those of Reddy and Valsangkar (1970). This method can be used to

analyze the buckling load of other pole structures such as steel power-transmission poles [see
ASCE (1974) and Dewey and Kempner (1975)] or even columns of varying end conditions.
The method used in program B-26 consists in the following steps:
1. Build the ASAT matrix and obtain the ASAT inverse of the pile system for whatever the
embedment geometry. It is necessary in this inverse, however, to develop the matrix such
as shown in Fig. 16-23«. All the rotation P-X are coded first, then the translation P-X
values. The resultant matrix can be partitioned as
In = ^i ^l *R
Ps A2 A3 Xs
2. From the lower right corner of the ASAT inverse (Fig. 16-236) take a new matrix called
the D matrix (of size NXS X NX5), identifying the translation or sidesway X's as
Xs = DP5 (a)
3. Develop a "second-order string matrix" considering one node deflection at a time as Fig.
16-246:
Pfs = GXsPcr (b)
4. Since Prs must be equal to Ps, substitute (b) into (a), noting that Pcr is a critical load column
matrix for which the placing order is not critical, to obtain

Figure 16-23 (a) General coding and notation used in the pile-buckling problem. The ground line can be spec-
ified at any node. Develop the ASAT, invert it, and obtain the D matrix from the location shown in (b).

This is an eigenvalue problem, which can be solved to some predetermined degree of
exactness (say, AX = 0.000000 1) by an iteration process proposed by Wang as follows:
1. Calculate the matrix product of DG (size NXS X NXS) and hold.
2. As a first approximation set the column matrix Xs(i) = 1.00.
3. Calculate a matrix X's = DGX5 using the value 1.00.
4. Normalize the X's matrix just computed by dividing all the values by the largest value.
5. Compare the differences of Xs -X's< AX and repeat steps 2 through 5 until the difference
criterion is satisfied. On the second and later cycles the current matrix values of Xs are
computed from the values of Xs from one cycle back.
6. When the convergence criterion has been satisfied, compute the buckling load using the
largest current values in the X's and Xs matrix as
y
p _ ^ s , max
c r ~~ Y
^ s, max
This step is simply solving Eq. (16-34) for PCY with the left side being the current compu-
tation of Xy using the preceding cycle X's on the right side.
If higher buckling modes are desired, and one should always compute at least the first two
since this method does not always give the lowest buckling load on the first mode (especially

of Eq. (16-35) see Wang (1967). The values of PCT and X are obtained as the values of the ith
buckling mode.
Any variation of skin resistance to reduce Pcr, as illustrated in Fig. 16-25 to develop the
string matrix, can be used. Note that no skin resistance is used in developing the ASA and
corresponding D matrix since the assumption of small values of rotation and translation for
vertical piles does not produce any skin-resistance effect. Note also that the lateral soil resis-
tance effect is included only in the ASAT matrix and not in the G matrix.
This solution can be readily compared with the theoretical solutions by applying one large
soil spring at the top and bottom of the pile and no intermediate values (i.e., the pile becomes
a beam column). It is possible to use a method (similar to that in your included computer
program B-5) of zeroing boundary conditions, except that this will not work for the case of a
fully embedded pile with top and bottom both specified zero. Satisfactory results can usually
be obtained with 8 to 15 finite elements.

Example 16-14. To illustrate pile buckling and the effect of soil on buckling of piles, the following
example will be presented. Its solution requires use of program FADPILB
(B-26), but you can see how buckling loads are affected by the soil from careful study of the
example.

Given. A 254-mm diam X 6.35-mm wall (10 X 0.25 in.) pipe pile that is 12 m in length. It is
embedded 5 m in an extremely soft soil (average qu for full depth is only 10 kPa) with the point
on rock as shown in Fig. E16-14a. We would like to estimate the buckling load. Assume the point
carries 50 percent of the buckling load (side friction carries a significant amount of the load of any
pile in any soil—even though this is a point-bearing design). Assume further that the side friction
distribution is parabolic (KPER = 2) as shown in Fig. 16-23. The first soil spring is reduced 25
percent for driving damage.

Solution. First draw a sketch and locate the pile nodes. Note the P-X coding here is automatically
done as in Fig. 16-23. That is, the rotation P-X values are numbered first, then the translation P-X
values. The program will also compute the moment of inertia of round solid, round pipe, tapered,
and square piles so all you have to input (in this case) is the diameter and wall thickness.
We will have to input ks, and we will use Eq. (16-26&) and not use the Nq-term, giving

The resulting computer output is shown on Fig. E16-14&. The Euler load shown is for a column
fixed at the ground line (making the effective column length 14 m). The Euler equation used is
p _ "'El
cr " kU
where k = 1 for members pinned on each end; = 2 for members fixed on one end; = 0.5 for
members fixed on both ends
L = length of column or member

Other terms have been previously defined.
The program uses JTSOIL; when it is 1 (fully embedded pile) the Euler critical load is computed
for a column pinned at each end. Of course, if ks = 0 the program inputs lateral node springs AT, = 0
so it is actually a column pinned at each end.
The program allows the user to specify boundary cases of fixing one or more nodes, however, in
the case of columns one of the nodes should be fixed by inputting a very large spring.
An alternate Euler load for this example would be for a column that is fixed on one end but 12 m
in length (effective length = 24 m). Inspection of the Euler load of 381.7 kN versus the computed
buckling (or critical) load of 198.0 kN (first mode) seems reasonable. We would expect a partially

embedded pile in a very soft soil not to have a buckling load as large as the Euler load of the free-
standing part fixed on one end. The computed buckling load of 198 kN should be larger than that
of a 12-m column fixed on only one end. This idea is left for the reader to check.
The critical buckling load of 1712.1 kN for the second mode is larger than the first mode. This
increase is generally the case, but if the second mode is smaller than the first, then the second
buckling mode governs. You should always obtain two buckling modes using a program such as
this.

PROBLEMS
Few answers are provided since a major part of pile design is selection of parameters. When param-
eters are provided all one does is solve a given equation.
16-1. A 460-mm diameter pipe pile is driven closed-end 15 m into a cohesionless soil with an esti-
mated <f> angle of 34°. The soil has a yWet = 16.50 kN/m3 and y' = 8.60 kN/m3. The GWT is
6 m below the ground surface. Estimate the ultimate pile capacity P11 using the /3 method and
friction angle 8 = 22°.
Answer: P14 « 510 kN (using K = 1.5KO)
16-2. A H P 3 6 0 X 152 pile is driven into a cohesionless soil with a </> angle = 34°. The soil has
Twet = 17.3 kN/m3 ; y' = 10.1 kN/m3 and the G W T is 3 m below the ground surface. Estimate
the pile capacity P11 using a pile length of 16 m, the /3 method, and 8 = 22° soil-to-steel and
26° soil-to-soil (in web zone). Use K = 1.0.
16-3. A pile is driven through a soft cohesive deposit overlying a stiff clay. The G W T is 5 m below
the ground surface and the stiff clay is at the 8-m depth. Other data:

Soft clay Stiff clay
ywet 17.5 19.3 kN/m3
y' 9.5 10.6 kN/m3
su 50 165 kPa

Estimate the length of a 550-mm diam pile to carry an allowable load Pa = 420 kN using an
SF = 4 and the A method.
Answer: L ~ 13 m
16-4. Redo Problem 16-3 using an HP360 X 109 pile.
Answer: L ~ 16 to 16.5 m
16-5. A J taper Union Mono tube pile with a top diam of 457 mm and a taper of 1 : 48 and a length
of 12.2 m is driven into a medium stiff clay deposit with an average su = 67 kPa. The pile will
later be filled with concrete. Estimate the ultimate capacity Pu using the a method and the API
value.
16-6. A Union Monotube F taper shell is driven into a cohesionless deposit with an average </> = 34°.
The ywet = 17.8 and y' = 9.8 kN/m3, and the GWT is 5 m below the ground surface. The pile
top diam = 460 mm and the taper is 1 : 48. For a length of 20 m what is the ultimate pile
capacity using Eq. (16-19)?


Figure P16-7

16-7. For the assigned boring log and pile (A, B, C, or D) of Fig. P16-7 estimate the pile capacity
using Meyerhof s or Vesic's equations for skin resistance and point capacity. These are actual
boring logs that have been converted to SI.
16-8. What is the approximate ultimate pullout resistance T14 for a tension pile in a medium dense sand
with (/> ~ 36°, y = 18.2 kN/m3, and using an 800-mm diameter concrete pile with a length of
5 m (and no bell)?
16-9. For the same data of Prob. 16-8 what is Tu if the diameter is only 300 mm, both without and
with a 1-m diameter bell?
16-10. Verify the skin resistance of the sand layers given on Fig. E16-7&.
16-11. Verify the skin resistance of the clay layers given on Fig. E16-7&. Recompute the a values.
Also, what is the effect if you use a single 27-m layer with a = 1 instead of the three layers of
the example?
16-12. See if you can reproduce the settlement computed and shown on the output sheets of Fig.
E16-76.

16-14. Check the side resistance of Example 16-8 and estimate if creep will be a problem. If creep is
a problem, how can you reduce its effect?
16-15. What is P11 for Fig. 16-18 if the pile perimeter = 1 . 3 m ; A £ = 2600 MN; L1 = 2 m (for all
three elements); and Ayp = 3 mm? Assume the point load Pp = 40 kN.
Answer: Pu ~ 657 kN
16-16. Do Example 16-12 for the other two load cases and, together with those given on Fig. E16-12&,
make a plot of Ph versus displacement 8. Also plot the shear and moment diagrams for the
assigned load case. If the Ph versus 8 plot is linear, what can be done to make it somewhat
nonlinear since real plots of this type are seldom linear except near the origin?
16-17. Make a copy of data set EX1612.DTA as EX1612A.DTA and apply a lateral load of Ph = 40
kN at node 1. Then make a second copy and fix node 4 against translation; make a third copy
and input a zero spring at node 4. Compare the results and answer the following:
a. What external cause could produce a fixed node 4?
b. What would reduce the spring at node 4 to 0?
16-18. Referring to Fig. P16-18 (see previous page), code and make an estimate of the P-A effect
[i.e., solve with the horizontal load, then resolve where you input a moment (need a 2nd NZX)
produced by the vertical load Pv X Atop with respect to the dredge line, continue doing this until
5tOp converges within about 0.01 m]. The two initial data sets are included as HP1619.DTA and
HP1619A.DTA on your program diskette.
16-19. Redo Example 16-13 using loads as follows:

jc-axis y-axis
Ph = My = 40 Ph = Mx = 20 kN or kN • m

Plot the results and see if there is any difference in the computed curve slopes. Explain why
there is or is not a difference.
16-20. Compute the Euler load for the pile of Example 16-14, assuming it is 14 m long and fixed at the
end bearing on rock, and compare your result with the buckling load shown on Fig. El6-142?.
16-21. Verify that the moment of inertia for the concrete base of Problem 16-22 would be input as

17-1 DYNAMIC ANALYSIS
Estimating the ultimate capacity of a pile while it is being driven into the ground at the site
has resulted in numerous equations being presented to the engineering profession. Unfortu-
nately, none of the equations is consistently reliable or reliable over an extended range of
pile capacity. Because of this, the best means for predicting pile capacity by dynamic means
consists in driving a pile, recording the driving history, and load testing the pile. It would
be reasonable to assume that other piles with a similar driving history at that site would de-
velop approximately the same load capacity. This chapter will examine some of the driving
equations, the load test, and some of the numerous reasons why dynamic pile prediction is
so poor. Some of the field problems associated with pile driving such as splicing, redriving,
and heave will also be briefly examined. A brief introduction to the wave equation method
of dynamic analysis will also be presented.
Probably one of the best sources of practical considerations in pile driving is given by Hal
Hunt, Design and Installation of Driven Pile Foundations, published by the Associated Pile
and Fitting Corp., Clifton, NJ, 1979 (217 pages).

17-2 PILE DRIVING
Piles are inserted into the ground using a pile hammer resting on or clamped to the top of the
pile cap, which is, in turn, connected to the pile. The pile may contain a capblock between
the cap and hammer as shown in Fig. 17-1. The cap usually rests on the pile and may be of,
or contain, adequate geometry to effect a reasonably close fit. A pile cushion is sometimes
used between the cap and pile (particularly concrete piles) to make the hammer impulses
produce a more uniform driving pressure across the pile cross section. The pile and hammer
are aligned vertically using leads suspended by a crane-type device except for the vibratory

which opens inlet and closes exhaust valves at B and
shuts inlet and opens exhaust at A; hammer then rises
from steam pressure at B. Ram in up position trips Sl,
which shuts inlet B and opens exhaust; valve A exhaust
closes; steam enters and accelerates
ram downward.

hammers, which normally do not use leads. Piles may also be inserted by jetting or partial
augering.
Leads provide free travel of the hammer as the pile penetrates the soil and are on the order
of 6 m longer than the pile to provide adequate space for the hammer and other appurtenances.
Mandrels are used to assist in driving pipe piles. These devices fit inside the pipe and
rest on the baseplate when the pipe is closed-end; they become the pile point for open-end
piles. The mandrel becomes the driving element, which basically drags the pipe down with
it during driving so that the thin pipe shell is not damaged.
Spuds are sometimes used in pile-driving operations to penetrate hard strata or seat the
pile in rock. The spud may be a separate driving device or simply a massive point attached to
the pile, especially for HP piles seated into rock. Seating a driven pile into sloping rock is a
difficult task as the pile may tend to follow the rock slope. This tendency may not be readily
detected without a load test. Special driving points may be required to assist in seating the
point adequately into the rock slope.
Pile hammers are the devices used to impart sufficient energy to the pile so that it penetrates
the soil. Several pile hammers are described in the following paragraphs.
Drop Hammers
Drop hammers are still occasionally used for small, relatively inaccessible jobs. The drop
hammer consists of a metal weight fitted with a lifting hook and guides for traveling down
the leads (or guides) with reasonable freedom and alignment. The hook is connected to a
cable, which fits over a sheave block and is connected to a hoisting drum. The weight is
lifted and tripped, freely falling to a collision with the pile. The impact drives the pile into
the ground. Principal disadvantages are the slow rate of blows and length of leads required
during the early driving to obtain a sufficient height of fall to drive the pile.

Single-Acting Hammers
Single-acting hammers are idealized in Fig. U-Ia. Steam or air pressure is used to lift the
ram to the necessary height. The ram then drops by gravity onto the anvil, which transmits
the impact energy to the capblock, thence to the pile. The hammer is characterized by a
relatively slow rate of blows. The hammer length must be such as to obtain a reasonable
impact velocity (h or height of ram fall), or else the driving energy will be small. The blow
rate is considerably higher than that of the drop hammer. In general the ratio of ram weight
to pile weight including appurtenances should be on the order of 0.5 to 1.0. Table A-2 in the
Appendix gives typical lengths and other useful data.

Double-Acting Hammers
These hammers (Fig. H-Ib) use steam both to lift the ram and to accelerate it downward.
Differential-acting hammers are quite similar except that more control over the steam (or air)
is exerted to maintain an essentially constant pressure (nonexpansion) on the accelerating side
of the ram piston. This increase in pressure results in a greater energy output per blow than
with the conventional double-acting hammer. The blow rate and energy output are usually
higher for double-acting or differential hammers (at least for the same ram weight), but steam
consumption is also higher than for the single-acting hammer. The length may be a meter or
more shorter for the double-acting hammer than for the single-acting hammer with length


ranges on the order of 2 to 4.5 m. The ratio of ram weight to pile weight should be between
0.50 and 1.
When compressed air instead of steam is used with single- or double-acting hammers,
there is the additional problem of the system icing up at temperatures close to freezing.

Diesel Hammers
Diesel hammers (Fig. 17-Ic) consist of a cylinder or casing, ram, anvil block, and simple
fuel injection system. To start the operation, the ram is raised in the field as fuel is injected
near the anvil block, then the ram is released. As the ram falls, the air and fuel compress and
become hot because of the compression; when the ram is near the anvil, the heat is sufficient
to ignite the air-fuel mixture. The resulting explosion (1) advances the pile and (2) lifts the
ram. If the pile advance is very great as in soft soils, the ram is not lifted by the explosion
sufficiently to ignite the air-fuel mixture on the next cycle, requiring that the ram be again
manually lifted. It is thus evident that the hammer works most efficiently in hard soils or
where the penetration is quite low (point-bearing piles when rock or hardpan is encountered)
because maximum ram lift will be obtained.
Diesel hammers are highly mobile, have low fuel consumption (on the order of 4 to 16
L/hr), are lighter than steam hammers, and operate efficiently in temperatures as low as 00C.
There is no need for a steam or air supply generation unit and the resulting hoses. The diesel
hammer has a length varying from about 3.5 to 8.2 m (4.5 to 6 m average). The ratio of ram
weight to pile weight should be on the order of 0.25 to 1.0.

Jetting or Preaugering
A water jet is sometimes used to assist in inserting the pile into the ground. That is, a high-
pressure stream of water is applied at the pile point to displace the soil. This method may be
used to loosen sand or small gravel where for some reason the pile must penetrate to a greater
depth in the material than necessary for point bearing. Care must be exercised that the jetting
does not lower the point-bearing value. Some additional driving after the jet is halted should
ensure seating the point on firm soil.
Preaugering is also sometimes used where a firm upper stratum overlies a compressible
stratum, which in turn overlies firmer material into which it is desired to seat the pile point.
Preaugering will reduce the driving effort through the upper firm material.
For both jetting and preaugering, considerable engineering judgment is required to model
the dynamic pile capacity equations (and static equations) to the field system.

Pile Extraction
Piles may be pulled for inspection for driving damage. Sudden increases of penetration rate
may be an indication of broken or badly bent piles. Pile extractors are devices specifically
fabricated for pulling piles. Double-acting steam hammers may be turned upside down and
suitably attached to the pile for the driving impulse and to a hoisting device (crane) to apply
a pull at least equal to the weight of the hammer and pile. The hammer impacts loosen and
lift the pile, and the crane provides a constant pull to hoist it from the hole. The lower broken
part of a wooden pile (metal piles seldom break) is usually left in place, but may cause further
driving problems.


Vibratory Drivers
Since about 1949 vibratory drivers have been used to insert piles. The principle of the vi-
bratory driver is two counterrotating eccentric weights (Fig. 17-Id). The frequency (ranging
from 0 to about 20 Hz) is readily computed using equations given in Chap. 20. The driver
provides two vertical impulses of as much as 70O+ kN at amplitudes of 6 to 50 mm each
revolution—one up and one down. The downward pulse acts with the pile weight to increase
the apparent gravity force. The pile insertion (also for terraprobing) is accomplished by

1. The push-pull of the counterrotating weights— push (+pile weight) > pull upward
2. The conversion of the soil in the immediate vicinity of the pile to a viscous fluid

Best results using vibratory driving are obtained in cohesionless deposits. Results are fairly
good in silty and clayey deposits. Impulse hammers are used in heavy clays or soils with
appreciable numbers of boulders.
Three principal advantages of the vibratory driver (where soils are compatible) are these:

1. Reduced driving vibrations—the vibrations are not eliminated but they are less than using
impact drivers.
2. Reduced noise.
3. Great speed of penetration—penetration rates of 5O+ mm/s are possible.
At present the ultimate pile capacity Pu for vibration-driven piles can only be estimated
using static pile methods, although Davisson (1970) developed an equation that purports to
estimate the capacity of the patented Bodine Resonant Driver (BRD) used principally by
Raymond Concrete Pile company. Other vibratory drivers currently used include the patented
vibro driver of the L. B. Foster company and a hydraulic-powered device available from
McKiernan-Terry Corporation. The BRD equation (but not for tip on rock) is
Pu = A ( y o + / c P Ob^kN) (17-1)
A = 550 ft • lb/s (Fps); 0.746 kJ/s (SI)
B = hammer weight, 22 000 Ib in Fps; 98 kN in SI for Bodine hammers
rp — final rate of penetration, m/s or ft/s
fl = frequency, Hz
SL = loss factor, ft/cycle or m/cycle (see table following)
hp = horsepower delivered to the pile

Loss factor for:
Closed-end pipe HP piles
Soil at pipe tip m/cycle x 10~3 (ft/cycle)
Loose silt, sand, or gravel 0.244 (0.0008) -0.213 (-0.0007)
Medium dense sand or sand 0.762 (0.0025) 0.762 (0.0025)
and gravel
Dense sand or sand and gravel 2.438 (0.008) 2.134 (0.007)


Example 17-1. Use the BRD equation to estimate the dynamic pile capacity on p. 12 of Foundation
Facts [the page following the Davisson (1970) reference]:

hp = 414 Final penetration rp = 240 s/ft = 787.4 s/m = 0.001 27 m/s
Closed-end pipe pile 325 X 4.54 mm wall approximately 30.5 m long and
filled with concrete after driving. Soil is dense coarse sand and gravel
(based on SPT blow count); thus, SL = 2.44 X 10"3 m/cycle from table,
a = 126 Hz.
Substituting, and with Bodine driver, we find
_ 0.746(414) + 98(0.001 27) _
^ " 0.00127 + 126(0.00244) ~1 U U U K W
The load test (pipe filled with concrete) indicated P14 = 2450 kN. The pile insertion was terminated
nearly on rock for which no SL was given, and one may debate if that action affects the foregoing
results. In pile driving, however, piles are often driven until the point reaches approximate refusal—
this practice will always affect the final penetration rate used in Eq. (17-1). It is expected that the
computed capacity of friction piles compared to load tests might be in closer agreement.

17-3 THE RATIONAL PILE FORMULA
Dynamic formulas have been widely used to predict pile capacity. Some means is needed
in the field to determine when a pile has reached a satisfactory bearing value other than by
simply driving it to some predetermined depth. Driving the pile to a predetermined depth may
or may not obtain the required bearing value because of normal soil variations both laterally
and vertically.
It is generally accepted that the dynamic formulas do not provide very reliable predictions.
Predictions tend to improve by using a load test in conjunction with the equation to adjust
the input variables. Predictions by persons with experience in a given area and using certain
equipment and with a good knowledge of the input variables of weights, etc., are often con-
siderably better than many of the predictions found in the literature where authors use the
reported results of other writers in statistical types of analyses.
The basic dynamic pile capacity formula, termed the rational pile formula, will be derived
in the following material. Nearly all the dynamic pile formulas currently used are based on
this equation—generally by simplifying certain terms. The rational pile formula depends
upon impulse-momentum principles.
For the derivation of the rational pile formulas, refer to Fig. 17-2 and the following list of
symbols. Applicable symbols from this list are used also with the several pile formulas of the
next section and in Table 17-1. The units for the symbol are in parentheses; e.g., (FTL) is the
product of variables with units of force, time, and length.

Many (of the more progressive) building codes no longer specify the pile-driving equation(s) to use

the local building official). Several other dynamic formulae are given in Young (1981).

If we assume at this instant the pile momentum Mp = /,the pile velocity is

Next, if we assume that the pile and ram have not separated at the end of the compression
period, the instantaneous velocities of the pile and ram are equal; therefore, combining equa-
tions (a) and (Z?), we have

The total energy available in the pile and ram at the end of the period of restitution is

and substituting (e) for vpr and (g) for vrr and with some simplification one obtains
Wr 2 ^ Wp 2 u,,W' + n2WP
J-/rr + ^/Pr = ehWrh ^ + ^ (h)
If the system were 100 percent efficient, the ultimate load P11 multiplied by the point dis-
placement s should be
Pus = ehWrh
The instant pile top displacement is s + k\ 4- &2 + &3, of which only s is permanent, and the
actual input energy to the pile system is
ehWrh = Pu(s + k{+ k2 + k3) = Pu(s + C)
Replacing the equivalent energy term with the equivalent from equation (Zz), we find
_ ehWrhWr + n2Wp

Cummings (1940) correctly points out that Eq. (h) already includes the effects of the losses
associated with kc, however, the form of Eq. (/) is generally accepted and used.
The term ki can be taken as the elastic compression of the pile PUL/AE with the corre-
sponding strain energy of P2UL/2AE.
Rewriting Eq. (/) and factoring out \ from all the k terms for strain energy, the Hiley
(1930)1 equation is obtained:
_ [ ehWrh TXWr + JW,]
" |_5 +'$(*! + *2 + *3)]L Wr + Wp J V

Cummings (1940) indicates that Redtenbacher (ca. 1859) may be the originator of this equation.


For double-acting or differential steam hammers, Chellis (1941, 1961) suggested the follow-
ing form of the Hiley equation:
p -\ g*£" i r ^ + " 2 ^ ! (17.3)
" [s+^kl + k2 + k3)\[ W + Wp \ (Ui)
According to Chellis, the manufacturer's energy rating of Ey1 is based on an equivalent ham-
mer weight term W and height of ram fall h as follows:
Eh = Wh = (Wr + weight of casing)/*
Inspection of the derivation of the Hiley equation indicates the energy loss fraction should be
modified to W as shown in Eq. (17-3) also.
A careful inspection of the Hiley equation or Eq. (/), together with a separation of terms,
results in

Energy in = work + impact loss + cap loss + pile loss + soil loss
ehWrh = Pus + euWh^1'^ + Pukx + Puk2 + Puk3
Wp + Wr
Best results from the dynamic formula as a pile capacity prediction tool are obtained when a
careful and separate assessment is made of the several loss factors.
There may be some question of the correctness of computing the strain energy k2 based on
a gradually applied Pu as P]1LlIAE when an impulse-type load is actually applied for which
the strain energy is P\L/AE. Use of the given equation form seems to give an adequate
estimate of the ultimate pile capacity; however, we might note that the k2 term would not
produce a great difference in Pu whether used as k2 or the more correct value of Ic2Jl.
It is necessary to use consistent units in Eqs. (17-2) and (17-3) so that the value of Pu is
obtained in the force units contained in Wr. For example, if h = ft and s = in., it is necessary
to multiply by 12; if h = m and s = mm, it is necessary to multiply by 1000 to obtain the
correct value of Pu.

17-4 OTHER DYNAMIC FORMULAS
AND GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
All of the dynamic pile-driving formulas except the Gates formula shown in Table 17-1 are
derived from Eq. (17-2) or (17-3) by using various assumptions. The assumptions usually
reflect the author's personal experiences and/or attempts to simplify the equation for practi-
cal use. Since interpretation of user experience is highly subjective and coupled with wide
variability of soils and hammer conditions, the dynamic formulas do not have very good corre-
lation with field experience—especially when used by others in different geographical areas
or for statistical comparisons. Statistical comparisons are especially difficult owing to the
scarcity of realistic input into the equations of hammer efficiencies, and weights of hammer
and driving equipment such as caps, capblocks, and driving points and any soil "plug." For
example, Chellis (1961) suggested that pile tips founded on rock or relatively impenetrable
material should use a value for pile weight of Wp/2. This can make some, even considerable,
difference in the loss factor. Also, where is the breakpoint for the factor 2? It would appear
that for medium dense materials a factor of 0.75 might be used, gradually increasing to 1.00
for friction piles. Likewise, if the user does not adjust the Hiley equation to include correctly
the ram and/or applicable portions of casing and anvil weights, considerable discrepancies


can result. Finally, the equations are heavily dependent on hammer efficiency, which must
be estimated and which can change during driving operations on the same job.
If we define the impact term in the Hiley equation as
= Wr + H

2Wp

1 W

r + Wp

and rearrange it to

1 + Yl1WrIWp
C l 1 + W
rIWp

and take n2WrIWp = 0, we obtain

1 1 + W

rIWp
which becomes the starting point for the several formula factors.
The Engineering News (commonly, but incorrectly termed the ENR) formula was pub-
lished in the Engineering News ca. 1888 (which merged with McGraw-Hill in 1917 to be-
come the Engineering News-Record) and was developed for wood piles using a drop hammer
with an approximate safety factor (SF) of 6. The formula has been modified for different driv-
ing equipment and is probably the most used of the several "dynamic" pile formulas. It was
obtained by lumping all the elastic compression into a single factor C = 25 mm (1 in.) with
C\ = 1 to obtain for drop hammers (length units of s and h must be the same)
P. - £g <n-4>
and for steam hammers with C = 2.54 mm (0.1 in.) obtain
_ ehWrh

Equations (17-4) and (17-5) will be called the ENR formulas.2 A more recent ENR modifi-
cation (and approximately as used in Table 17-5) is
p _(ehWrh\(Wr + niWp\
P"-{s + c)[Wr + W
p j

 ( 1 7 6 )
Values of k\ for use in Eq. (17-2) or (17-3) are presented in Table 17-2. Values of hammer
efficiency depend on the condition of the hammer and capblock and possibly the soil (espe-
cially for diesel hammers). In the absence of known values the following may be taken as
representative of hammers in reasonably good operating condition:

Type Efficiency eh
Drop hammers 0.75-1.00
Single-acting hammers 0.75-0.85
Double-acting or differential 0.85
Diesel hammers 0.85-1.00

2The author will refer to these formulas as the ENR since this is its commonly used designation in nearly all of the
technical literature on pile driving.

Chellis (1961) suggested increasing the efficiency 10 percent when using Eq. (17-2) or
(17-3) to compute the driving stresses. Since the reliability of the equations is already with
considerable scatter both (+) and (-), it does not appear necessary to make this adjustment.
Table 17-3 presents representative values of the coefficient of restitution n. Again the ac-
tual value will depend upon the type and condition of the capblock material and whether a
pile cushion is used with concrete piles.
The term ki is computed as PUL/AE, and one may arbitrarily take the /^ term (quake) as
&3 = 0.0 for hard soil (rock, very dense sand, and gravels)
= 2.5 to 5 mm (0.1 to 0.2 in.)
Equation (17-2) and following must be adjusted when piles are driven on a batter. It will be
necessary to compute the axial pile component of Wrh and further reduce this for the friction
lost due to the normal component of the pile hammer on the leads or guide. A reasonable
estimate of the friction coefficient/ between hammer and leads may be taken as
/ = tan0 = 0.10

For small wood piles on the order of 100 to 150 mm used to support small buildings on
soil with a water table at or very near the ground surface Yttrup et al. (1989) suggest using

PU = ^ (17-7)

in kN when W = kN; h, s = m. This formula is applicable for drop hammers mounted on
small conventional tractors.

PLUG WEIGHT. Open-end pipe piles always cut a soil plug. The plug usually does not fill
the pipe when observed from above since it is much compressed both from vibration and
from side friction on the interior walls. The plug weight can be estimated as
Wpiug = y' X Vpipe (17-8)
where Vpipe = internal pipe volume. This weight may be critical when the pile is nearly
driven to the required depth since it is a maximum at that time.
HP piles will also have a plug of unknown dimensions; however, it would not be a great
error to assume the plug length Lpiug is one-half the embedded length of the pile (when blow
counts are taken for pile capacity or for penetration resistance). The plug weight (refer also
to Fig. 16-lie) in this case is
Wplug = 0.50Lpile XbfXdXy' (17-8«)
Equation (H-Sa) includes the web tw and flange thickness tf in the soil volume but the plug
length is an estimate, so the computation as shown is adequate.
Use effective unit weight y' for the soil, as the water will have a flotation effect for both
the soil and the pile.
The "pile" weight should be the actual weight Wp plus plug, or
Wp = Wp + Wplug (17-9)
for use in any of the equations given that uses a pile weight term Wp.
The plug weight was not included in the past because few persons ever checked the deriva-
tion of the equations to see how the pile weight term was treated. Do not include the plug
weight unless the equation you are using includes the pile weight in a term similar to the
second term in the Hiley equation.

Example 17-2. Estimate the allowable pile capacity of test pile No. 1 reported by Mansur and
Hunter (1970, Tables 2, 4, 5, and 6) by the ENR, Janbu, Gates, and Hiley equations (see Table
17-1) and Eq. (17-3). The data have been converted to SI for this edition. (The example in Fps is in
the previous edition.)

AE = 11 045 X 0.200 = 2209 MN (the 106 terms cancel)
Cd = 0.75 + 0.15 X ^ = 0.75 + 0.15 X 7 ^ - = 0.80
Wr 63.3

Making the necessary substitutions, we find

c. By the Gates equation (see Table 17-1) with SF = 3:
P11 = a J^E~h(b - logs) = 104.5 7 ^ ( 2 . 4 - log5)
Making substitutions, we obtain
Pu = 104.5 V0.78 X 48.8 (2.4 - log 19) = 754 kN
Pa = 1 ^ = 251 kN

Let us estimate fci:


From Table 17-2 we have

3.0 10.5
5.0 14.0

Interpolating, we obtain k\ = 3 . 5 mm.
The term k$ = 2.5 mm [given in text following Eq. (17-6)]. Then we obtain ks by trial. As a
first trial, assume P14 = 900 kN:
P L 900 X 16 76
k2 = ~-=r = '— = 6.8 mm (Note: The 10" terms cancel as used.)

s = 1 9 mm (set per blow and given) n = 0.5 (Table 17-3)
Substituting values into Eq. (17-3) (1000 converts kN • m to kN • mm), we obtain

Since we used P14 = 900 kN and computed 1331 kN, we must revise ks to something between
900 and 1331. Try P11 = 1260 and by proportion obtain k2 = 6.8x1260/900 = 9.5 mm; again,
substituting, we have

The Gates value of Pa for design would be recommended. It was developed for this range of pile
capacities. It does not, however, give the best load test value. Both the ENR and Hiley equations give
better values for this case. The ENR and Gates equations have the advantage of simplicity. From
this spread of Pu it is evident that one should always use more than one equation to see if there are
large differences. The agreement of the ENR and Hiley equations may be as much coincidence as
equation accuracy.

Example 17-3. Estimate the ultimate pile capacity Pu of test pile No. 6 (HP pile) from the Mansur
and Hunter (1970) reference. Use the ENR, Janbu, and PCUBC equations. The original Fps data


were soft-converted to SI by the author. Given:
HP360 X 109(14 X 73) (see Table A-I of Appendix for pile section data)
Capblock = 5.4 kN (1220 Ib) Pile length L = 12.18 m (40 ft)
Hammer: Vulcan 80C Eh = 33.12 kN • m y' = 9.8 kN/m3
Wr = 35.58 kN (see Table A-2 of Appendix)
Pile weight without plug = 109 X 9.807 X 12.18/1000 = 13.01 kN
Pile weight + capblock = Wp = 13.01 + 5.4 = 18.4 kN
Pile weight with plug = 18.4 + 0.5 X 12.18 X 0.346 X 0.371 X 9.8 = 26.2 kN
AE = 3 313 000 kN Take eh = 0.84

Since the 900 kN assumed is sufficiently close to the 890 kN computed, we will use Pu =
89OkN.
Summary,

The use of a soil plug for the PCUBC formula reduces the computed value from about 960 to
890 but appears (when compared with the other methods) to give a more reasonable value—or at
least as good a value as not considering the plug.

17-5 RELIABILITY OF DYNAMIC PILE-DRIVING
FORMULAS
Many attempts have been made to improve the reliability of the dynamic formulas. A most
comprehensive pile-testing program was undertaken under the direction of the Michigan
State Highway Commission (1965). In this program 88 piles were driven and tested as shown
in Table 17-4 using the following hammers in the driving operations:

Vulcan No. l,50C and 80C
McKiernan-Terry DE30 and DE40
Raymond 15-M
Link-Belt 312 and 520
DelmagD12andD22

From using the various dynamic formulas based on pile-load tests this study found that
the true safety factors are as indicated in Table 17-5. The table indicates reasonable values
for the Gates formula in the 0- to 1800-kN load range (range in which the formula was de-
rived). The modified Engineering News-Record [Eq. (17-6)] formula is reasonably valid over
the entire range of load tests. It was proposed from these tests that the modified Engineering
News-Record formula as given in Eq. (17-6) be further modified as shown in Table 17-1. This
study also brought to light that the amount of energy actually input to the pile for penetration
is considerably different from the manufacturer's rating. The actual energy input was heavily

dependent on hammer base, capblock, pile cap, and pile cap-pile interfacing. Energy input/E^
was found to range from about 26 to 65 percent—averaging less than 50.
Olson and Flaate (1967) performed a statistical analysis on some 93 other piles and con-
cluded that the Hiley equation [Eq. (17-3)] and the Janbu and Gates formulas (Table 17-1)
produced the least deviations and highest statistical correlations. This analysis was based
largely on data reported in the literature; thus, some considerable estimating of pile weight,
average penetration, pile cap weight, capblock weight, and condition (for n and use of a cush-
ion for concrete piles) was required. The hammer condition, which would be particularly
critical in obtaining either en or En, was generally not known.
An earlier statistical analysis of 30 piles of timber, steel, and concrete was presented by
ASCE (1946, p. 28) from a previous discussion of a progress report [ASCE (1941)], which
prompted Peck (1942) to propose a pile formula of Pu = 810 kN (91 tons). For the reported
data it was statistically as good as any of the several dynamic equations used for computing
the pile capacity.
A major problem with using statistical analyses primarily based on piles reported in tech-
nical literature is that although one can obtain a large data base it is not of much value.
The reason is that there are not sufficient data given for the reader to make a reliable judg-
ment of significant parameters to consider. Where the person making the analysis uses a
self-generated data base (as in the case of Gates) results are generally more reliable.

17-6 THE WAVE EQUATION
The wave equation is based on using the stress wave from the hammer impact in finite-
element analysis. This method was first put into practical form by Smith (1962) and later by
others. A more detailed discussion of the principles and a reasonably sophisticated computer
program are readily available [Bowles (1974a) or B-27] and will not be repeated here.


The wave equation has particular application for piling contractors in determining pile
drivability with available equipment in advance of project bidding. It may also be used to es-
timate pile-driving stresses but does not have much application in prediction of pile capacity.
According to a pile practice survey reported by Focht and O'Neill (1985) the wave equa-
tion was used by about 30 percent of the practitioners at the time of the survey with most
usage in the United States and Canada. The survey did not include contractors, so their usage
is unknown. This lag between state-of-art and the state of practice is typical and results, in
this case, partly from requiring both a computer and a computer program [although the lat-
ter may not be a valid reason, since this textbook included a program in 1968 as well as in
Bowles (1974)]. Programs by others have been available for purchase for some time as well.
Uses of the Wave Equation
The wave equation is usually used to investigate the following problems:

1. Pile capacity. A plot of P14 versus set is made and the load test plotted on the curve to
obtain the correct curve.
2. Equipment compatibility. Solutions are not obtained when the hammer is too big or too
small for the pile.
3. Driving stresses. Plots of stress versus set can be made to ensure that the pile is not over-
stressed.

For the discussion to follow, refer to the list of symbols:
A = cross-sectional area of pile
Cm = relative displacement between two adjacent pile elements
D9Jn = element displacement two time intervals back
D'm = element displacement in preceding time interval DT (previous DT)
Dm = current element displacement
Dsm = plastic ground displacement
DT = time interval (At on Fig. 17-3c)
Ep = modulus of elasticity of pile material
Fm = element force = CmKm
Fam = unbalanced force in element causing acceleration (F = ma)
g = gravitation constant
Ji = damping constant; use Js for side value, Jp = point value
Km = element springs = AE/L for pile segments
K'm = soil springs = /?/quake
Li = length of pile element (usually constant)
Rm = side or point resistance including damping effects
R'm = amount of pile resistance (fraction of R14) estimated to be carried by each element
including the pointy'; for 100 percent of Ru on pointy, the values of R^ through Ru
of Fig. 17-36 are zero, and Rn = Rw Usually Rm of the first pile element is taken
as zero for any assumed distribution of side and point resistance.
Ru = assumed ultimate pile capacity (same as Pu used previously)

t = current instant in time = number of iterations X DT
vm = velocity of element m at DT
v'm = velocity of element m at DT - 1
Wm = weight of pile segment m

A pile is formed into a set of discrete elements as shown in Fig. 17-3. The system is then
considered in a series of separate time intervals DT chosen sufficiently small that the stress
wave should just travel from one element into the next lower element during DT. Practically,

this time choice is not possible, and DT is taken as a value that usually works, as in the
following table:

Element material Length, m Trial DT, s

Steel 2.4-3.1 0.00025
Wood 2.4-3.1 0.00025
Concrete 2.4-3.1 0.00033

For shorter lengths, DT should be made correspondingly smaller. The actual time DT can be
approximately computed as
DT = C 1^tL9 s
V AEPS
where C is 0.5 to 0.75; L1 = element length; g = 9.807 m/s2 (in SI).
The finite-element form of the differential equation used in the wave analysis is
Dm = 2D'm -D'm + ^ ( D T ) 2 (17-10)
It is not necessary to solve this equation directly, however, since the items of interest for each
assumed value of ultimate pile capacity Pu are these:

1. Forces in each pile segment
2. Displacement (or set) of the pile point

The instantaneous element displacement is computed alternatively as
Dm = D'm + i;m(DT) (a)
With the instantaneous element displacements, the relative compression or tension movement
can be computed between any two adjacent elements as
Cm = Dm-Dm+l (b)
The force in segment m is

Fm = Cm ( — j = CmKm (C)
\ L Im

The soil springs are computed as

The side or point resistance term is obtained using damping with the side or point value of J
and K1 as appropriate:
Rm = (Dm - Dsm)Km(l + Jvm) (*)
The accelerating force in segment m is obtained by summing forces on the element to obtain


The element velocity is computed as

vm = v'm + % ^ ( D T ) (g)

The wave equation requires the following computation steps:

1. Compute the displacements of each element in turn using Eq. (a) and consistent units. At
DT = 1 there is only a displacement in element m = 1; at DT = 2 there are two dis-
placements; at DT = 3 there are three displacements; DT = m computes displacements
in all m pile elements.
2. Compute the plastic ground displacements Dsm. Values will be obtained only when Dm >
quake or elastic ground displacement, i.e.,
Dsm = Q-Dm (butDsm>0)
This step requires two subroutines—one for the point element and one using a loop for all
the other pile elements.
3. Compute side and point resistance Rm (use p instead of m for point) using Eq. (e). Use
Js = side damping for all except the point element; use Jp = point damping for point
element. This requires one equation in a DO loop and a separate point equation.
4. Compute the spring compression in each element Cm using Eq. (b).
5. Compute the forces in each element using Cm and the spring constant AE/L as Eq. (c).
Forces in the capblock and pile cap are computed separately using subroutines because
these elements are not usually carrying tension and because of restitution with the dissim-
ilar materials in the capblock and cap cushion (if used).
6. Compute the velocity of each element using Eq. (g).
7. Set the computed Dm and vm into storage and reidentify as one time interval back (i.e.,
become D'm and v'm so new values can be computed for Dm and vm for the current (new)
DT).
8. Repeat as necessary (generally not less than 40 and not more than 100 iterations unless a
poor value of DT is chosen or the pile-hammer compatibility is poor) until
a. All the velocities become negative, and
b. The point-set value becomes smaller than on previous cycles(s).

The wave equation analysis requires input data as follows:

a. Height of ram fall and ram weight P (obtain from tables such as A-2). The height is either
given or back-computed as h = Eh/Wr. This is needed to obtain the velocity of the pile
cap at DT = 1 (instant of impact), which is computed as
vi = Jeh{2gh)
b. Weight of pile cap, capblock, pile segments, driving shoe, and modulus of elasticity of
pile material.
c. Values of capblock and pile cushion spring constants. Table 17-6 gives values of modulus
of elasticity E for several materials used for these elements for computing the spring as
K = AE/L. Use Table 17-3 for coefficient of restitution.

d. Soil properties:
Quake (same as £3 used earlier)
Point damping Jp (PJ in computer program)
Side damping Js (SJ in computer program)—usually about Jp/3
Sovinic et al. (1985) performed a number of load tests on pipe piles driven open-ended
and concluded that the soil plug reduces the point and side damping values on the order of
Jp/5 and Js/5. Although they did not test any HP piles, it would be reasonable to apply a
reduction for those as well—but not nearly so large. Smith (1962) initially did not consider
soil plugs; he used an HP310 X 79 (HP12 X 53) pile as an example, but most of the
pipe piles considered were apparently driven closed-end—some were mandrel-driven. It
is quite possible, however, that the original Smith HP pile example was for illustration of
the method and not one where there was a load test to compare with the computed capacity
by the wave equation analysis.
Typical values (no plug) for quake and for both Q and Jp (use Js = Jp/3) are as follows:

Quake Damping constant Jp*
Soil in. mm s/ft s/m

Sand 0.05-0.20 1.0-5.0 0.10-0.20 0.33-0.66
Clay 0.05-0.30 1.0-8.0 0.40-1.00 1.30-3.30
Rock > 0.20 > 5.0
* Reduce damping constants when there is a soil plug.

e. Estimate of percentage of the ultimate load Pu carried by the pile point (0 to 100 percent).
In general, no pile carries 100 percent of the load on the point, and one should not use more
than 80 to 95 percent on the point. Placing 100 percent of the load on the point produces a
discontinuity in computations, since side load from skin resistance will include damping
as shown in Eq. (/), with no side resistance K'm = 0.0.


Plots of Pu versus blows per centimeter (cm) (or inch) are made by assuming several
values of P11 and using the wave equation computer program to obtain the set. The blows per
centimeter Af is obtained as
N=1-
S
For any curve the percentage of Pu assumed to be carried by the pile point is held constant
as, say, 25, 50, 75, 95 percent.
Plots of l/s (or AO versus driving stress are obtained for any given Pu by obtaining from the
computer output the maximum element force and the corresponding point set for some value
of DT. Several other values of maximum element force (not necessarily in the same element)
and set at other DTs are also selected so that enough points are obtained to draw a curve. This
curve is somewhat erratic, owing to the mathematical model, and must be "faired" through
the origin, since it is usually not possible to obtain l/s values as low as 0.5,1.0 and 1.5 or 2.0.
In the region of large l/s it is evident that the curve will approach some asymptotic value of
driving stress. Curves of Pu versus blows per centimeter and driving stress versus blows per
centimeter are shown in Fig. 17-4.

Traces of several stress waves down a pile are shown in Fig. 17-5 for a pile with the
following data:
HP310 X 79 [HP12 X 53 as used by Smith (1962)]; Lp = 30 m;
Use 10 pile elements of 3 m each; Driving point = 0.44 kN;
Pile cap = 3.10 kN; pile cross section = 0.010 m2;
Wt./m of pile = 0.774 kN/m (steel p = 7850 kg/m3); E = 200000 Mpa;
Hammer: Ram = 22.2 kN; height of fall h = 0.91 m; eh = 0.80;
Jp = 0.50 s/m; Js = 0.16 s/m; Ar = 0.00025 s;
Capblockn = 0.5; capblock spring K = 350 000 kN/m;
Point load = 1 0 0 and 0 percent; estimated pile load Ru = 900 kN
The program FADWAVE (B-27) has several output options: one is just the set and last set
of computed pile element forces; a second option is that shown in Fig. 17-6; and a third option
(not shown but used to plot Fig. 17-5) outputs the data of Fig. 17-6 plus the pile forces for
each time increment DT (in program). The time values shown were selected, rounded, and
plotted as shown in Fig. 17-5.
The output sheet of Fig. 17-6 echoes the input data (given above) and for each DT gives
the set, point displacement D, maximum force in the pile F, and the element in which it
occurs. For example, at time increment DT = 1 6 when the first point displacement occurs,
the force in element 5 is 1240.3 kN. The point does not have any set until DT = 32, when it
is 0.407 mm, with a point displacement D = 2.907 mm. The maximum pile force at this DT
is in element 4 and is 964.3 kN. The maximum set = 10.417 mm and is the average of the
last 6 DT computations (if you add the set values for DT = 57 through 62 and divide by 6 you

should obtain 10.417). An average is used based on the difference between the maximum
set (occurs at DT — 60), and the program checks adjacent values and finds those within
0.12 mm of that value. All of these values are summed and divided by the number. Some-
times there are only three or four values—here there were six. The last six values are aver-
aged for the set since these are so close that it is difficult to determine exactly what the set
should be.
This large set (10.417 mm) occurs because the point is assumed not to carry any load. For
the case of the point carrying 100 percent of the load the set = 4.881 mm. These are the
two limiting cases—for the point carrying 20 to 80 percent of the load the point set would be
somewhere between 4.881 and 10.417 mm.
To plot Fig. Il-4a one would need to obtain the set from several assumed values of Ru (900,
1200, 1500, . . . ) and for each execution obtain the blow/cm (as 1/1.0417 = 0.959). Since
there is no such thing as a fraction of a blow, this should be rounded to 1 (an integer). The value
would be 1/10.417 = 0.09 using mm; for the point load case we obtain 1/0.4881 = 2.04,
which can be plotted as 2.0 (but not 1/4.881 = 0.20). Thus, it is necessary to plot these
curves using 1/set with set in cm and not mm.
To plot the curve of Fig. 17-4Z? we must extract the set and corresponding F from cal-
culations such as Fig. 17-6. We can use the list of maximum element forces versus DT to
find worst cases, but there must be a "set" for the cases selected. For example, the max-
imum force in element 2 occurs at DT = 7 but at this time the set = 0. The first set of
0.407 mm = 0.0407 cm occurs at DT = 32 when the force F = 964.3 kN. This data lo-
cates a curve point at a = F/A = 964.3/0.0139 = 69.4MPa versus 1/0.0407 - 24.6 -* 25
(blows/cm). At DT = 43 we have a = 833/0.0139 = 59.9 MPa versus 1/0.724 cm = 1.38
(blows/cm). We can plot the nonintegers, but the curve user can carry out only integer blow
counts. The reader should obtain several additional points and draw a curve similar to Fig.
17-46.

General Comments on the Wave Equation
There have been a number of modifications to the original wave equation to include what
the programmer asserts to be better modeling of the soil effects on the shaft sides [R(M)],
of the interface elements (ram, anvil, capblock, etc.) to the pile, and in the case of the diesel
hammer, to model the fuel-mixture explosion. In all these cases the result is little better than
the original Smith proposal (if proper allowances are made) for a number of reasons. The
point and shaft resistances and quake are at best factors that make the program give a solution.
The hammer impacts and resulting pile vibration will reduce the soil immediately adjacent
to the pile shaft and point to a viscous fluid. The "viscosity" probably does increase with
depth but this problem can be accounted for by inputting an R(M) different for each pile
segment. Since a wide range of quake gives solutions with not much difference, it is evident
that this is a "make it work factor," although certain factors do work better than others. Those
recommended by Smith work as well as any. A similar statement can be made for the side
and point damping factors.
Modeling the pile-hammer interface is at best an exercise in computational tenacity. The
different hammers have different anvil configurations (and dimensions), the driving cap
varies widely, and the capblock "spring" varies widely (even during driving the same pile)
depending on how much it has been used. Pile input energy is heavily dependent on the me-
chanical state of the hammer. Considering all these variables, it is suggested that the simplest


form of the wave equation is adequate. Any comparison between computer output and pre-
dicted pile capacity within a 30 percent deviation is likely to be a happy coincidence of input
data [see also the comprehensive study by Tavenas and Audibert (1977)] rather than com-
puter program sophistication. It is relatively easy with any of the wave equation programs
to back-compute excellent correlation with a load test. It is less easy to predict the load test
results in advance, however.
Since the wave equation is really concerned with the energy that the pile segments "re-
ceive,'* it should be evident that the energy input to the program is only an estimate unless it is
directly measured via strain gauges or velocity- or acceleration-measuring devices attached
to one or more of the upper pile segments. This approach is essentially that of Rausche and
Goble (1979) where the force/acceleration measurements are then directly input into a wave
equation type of program.
A number of programs purport to model the input energy of the diesel hammer using the
"blast energy." Since the fuel-explosion energy is somewhat indeterminate and as previously
stated the energy output depends on the mechanical condition of the hammer, it is evident
that the earlier programs, which are much simpler, can as easily be used. It is only necessary
to input the correct energy (i.e., adjust either ram weight or height of fall K) so that the energy
output is the same as assumed for the blast force. The capblock "spring" can be adjusted to
account for the interfacing of the diesel hammer elements, which might be different from a
steam hammer. Again, the problem is solved if the first pile segment is instrumented to obtain
the energy input.
A number of the early wave equation programs had an interface modeling error [in Smith's
original paper; found by the author when developing a wave equation for the vibratory pile
driver (unpublished)]. This error could affect the output by as much as 5 percent. This kind
of error is difficult to find since minor variations in input and order of magnitude of the output
forces are such that small errors are usually insignificant.

17-7 PILE-LOADTESTS
The most reliable method to determine the load capacity of a pile is to load-test it. This consists
in driving the pile to the design depth and applying a series of loads by some means. The usual
procedure is to drive several of the piles in a group and use two or more of the adjacent piles
for reactions to apply the load. A rigid beam spans across the test pile and is securely attached
to the reaction piles. A large-capacity jack is placed between the reaction beam and the top
of the test pile to produce the test load increments. The general setup (Fig. Yl-Ic) is similar
to the plate load test shown in Fig. 4-8 with the plate being replaced by the pile. The test
has been standardized as ASTM D 1143; however, local building codes may stipulate the
load increments and time sequence. Somewhat similar means are used to test laterally loaded
piles. Here the lateral load may be applied by jacking two adjacent piles apart or suitably
connecting several piles for the lateral reaction.
Figure 17-7 illustrates typical data from a pile-load test. Figure 17-7« is the usual plot for
a load test.
The ultimate pile load is commonly taken as the load where the load-settlement curve
approaches a vertical asymptote as for the 2200 kN load shown in Fig. 17-7«, or as the load
corresponding to some amount of butt settlement, say, 25 mm, based on the general shape
of the load-settlement curve, design load of the pile, and local building code (if any). The


Figure 17-7 Pile load-test data. This is the pile shown in Fig. Pl6-7 (356 diam X 7.9 mm wall X 15.24 m long). The method of estimating end bearing and side resistance
shown in (a) was suggested by Van Weele (1957).

load-settlement curve must be drawn to a suitably large settlement scale so that the shape
(and slope) is well defined. Referring to Fig. Yl-Ia, we see that reducing the vertical scale
by a factor of one-half would make it very difficult to determine that the curve is becoming
nearly vertical between the 2000 and 2200 kN load.
An alternative method of interpreting Fig. Xl-Ia is based on the concept that the load
is carried mostly by skin resistance until the shaft slip is sufficient to mobilize the limiting
value. When the limiting skin resistance is mobilized, the point load increases nearly linearly
until the ultimate point capacity is reached. At this point further applied load results in direct
settlement (load curve becomes vertical). Referring to Fig. 17-Ia, these statements translate
as follows:

1. From 0 to point a the capacity is based on the skin resistance plus any small point con-
tribution. The skin resistance capacity is the principal load-carrying mechanism in this
region. Point a usually requires some visual interpretation since there is seldom a sharp
break in the curve.
2. From point a to b the load capacity is the sum of the limiting skin resistance (now a
constant) plus the point capacity.
3. From point b the curve becomes vertical as the ultimate point capacity is reached. Often
the vertical asymptote is anticipated (or the load to some value is adequate) and the test
terminated before a "vertical" curve branch is established.

This concept was introduced by Van Weele (1957) and has since been used by others [e.g.,
Brierley et al. (1979), Leonards and Lovell (1979), among others]. According to Van Weele,
if we draw the dashed line 0 to c through the origin and parallel to the point capacity region
from a to b, the load-carrying components of the pile are as shown on Fig. 17-7a. In this
figure we have at settlement S = 25 mm the load carried as follows:
Point - 25OkN
Skin resistance = 1350 kN = 1600 - 250 kN
Total = 160OkN shown on figure
Local building codes usually stipulate how the load test is to be run and interpreted and
pile design loads above which a load test is required (usually Pd > 200 kN). For example,
the Chicago building code stipulates the test as follows:

1. Apply load increments of 25 percent of the proposed working load.
2. Carry the loading to two times the proposed working load. This requires seven or eight
load increments.
3. Apply the loads after a specified time lapse or after the settlement rate is some small value.
4. The allowable pile load is taken as one-half that load that causes a net settlement of not
more than 1 mm/35 kN. For example, in referring to Fig. Yl-Ib, the allowable pile load is
about 1100 kN (so 2 X 1100/35 = 63 mm versus about 70 mm measured).
5. The building codes limit the minimum value of hammer energy E^
6. The codes require a minimum number of test piles per project.


Figure 17-7(c) Typical pile load test setup using adjacent piles in group for reaction.

Piles in granular soils are often tested 24 to 48 hr after driving when load test arrangements
have been made. This time lapse is usually sufficient for excess pore pressures to dissipate;
however, Samson and Authier (1986) show that up to a 70 percent capacity gain may occur
if load tests are made two to three weeks after driving.
Piles in cohesive soils should be tested after sufficient lapse for excess pore pressures
to dissipate. This time lapse is commonly on the order of 30 to 90 days giving also some
additional strength gain from thixotropic effects.
In any soil sufficient time should elapse before testing to allow partial dissipation of resid-
ual compression stresses in the lower shaft and point load from negative skin resistance on
the upper shaft caused by shaft expansion upward as the hammer energy is released. Resid-
ual stresses and/or forces have been observed in a number of reports and summarized by
Vesic (1977). It appears that pile load testing of the load-unload-reload type is more likely to
produce residual stresses than driving.
ASTM Dl 143 gives the "standard" pile load test procedure and outlines in considerable
detail the data to be collected in addition to load versus butt displacement. It would, of course,
be most worthwhile for the various organizations that publish technical papers (such as ASCE
and CGJ) to establish a similar checklist of information that would be the minimum to be
included for the paper to be accepted for publication. This would give readers sufficient in-
formation to verify or provide alternative conclusions as well as to create a useful data base
for future correlations that are more reliable. This is particularly important for piles since, as
noted in Chap. 16, such a large amount of conflicting test data have been published.

17-8 PILE-DRIVINGSTRESSES
A pile must be adequately sized to satisfy both the static and dynamic (or driving) stresses.
The driving stresses are difficult to determine except as approximations. Stresses are com-
puted as PdM, and the limitations inherent in the dynamic equations exist for computing the
driving force Pd so that a stress can be computed.

The wave equation seems to provide the best means to estimate the driving force Pj, both
for compression in all piles and tension in concrete piles, and to find compressive and tension
loads in the pile elements.
Figure 17-6, which is a printout of a wave equation trial, shows that the maximum force
Pd = 1341.6 kN; this occurred in element 4 at DT = 13. Because this was a metal pile
we do not need tension forces, but the pile had some (with the proper option activated, the
program would also collect the largest negative forces in the elements as well). The option
should always be activated for concrete piles.
The pile element forces depend on two factors in a wave equation analysis:

1. The estimated ultimate load P11 = Ru (used as RU in program)
2. The amount of load estimated to be carried by the point

For the pile of Fig. 17-5 we have 100 percent point load and 0.0 point load—the two
extremes. In this case the maximum loads are these:

Point load Pile element Prf,kN AtDT
100% 10 (bottom) 1808.2 34 (of 59)
0% (Fig. 17-6) 4 (near top) 1341.6 13 (of 62)

Also DT = 1/4000 = 0.00025 sec. These data are for an estimated Pu = 900 kN, so it
appears that the driving stresses can be from 50 to 100 percent larger than the estimated
ultimate load.
The dynamic equations (such as the ENR and Hiley types) can also be used to estimate
driving stresses and set. The use of the Hiley equation is illustrated in Example 17-4 follow-
ing.
Since the pile driving supervisor can only obtain blow counts in the field, it is useful to
present the data as illustrated in Fig. 17-4 or in E17-4. It should be evident, however, that
the curves in these two figures represent particular pile-hammer combinations. A change in
either invalidates the curves.
It should also be evident that a measurement of "set" is not straightforward, rather it must
be done indirectly. The reason is that there is both "set" and axial compression (PL/AE)
during driving. This makes it necessary to attach some type of scribing device to the pile head
(for measurements when the approximate design depth is reached) so that the scribe moves
down at impact and back up but not to the original starting point. The difference between the
starting point and the final point (below the initial) is assumed as the "set" for that blow.
There is a question of what the limit should be on driving stresses. Since they are temporary
and always higher than the design load stresses, some leeway must be allowed. Driving on
the order of 0.85/c' has resulted in fracture of concrete piles, so it would appear that their
stresses should be limited to about 0.5 to 0.6/c'.
Driving stresses for wood piles should also be limited to about 0.5 to 0.6/ujt because of
knots and other interior flaws.
Steel piles can probably be limited to stresses on the order of 0.8 to 0.9 fy. If steel piles are
stressed into the yield zone the principal result is increased possibility of corrosion from flak-
ing off of mill scale as Luder (or slip) lines form. There is also opinion that driving stresses
for steel piles can be from fy to as much as 1.15 fy because of strain-hardening. The author


suggests not over 0.9 fy as a reasonable compromise, knowing that we are being optimistic if
the driving stresses are not over ±20 percent of the estimate.

Example 17-4. Make a set versus driving resistance curve using the Hiley equation [Eq. (17-2)]

In this form the equation was programmed (since Pu is on both sides of the equation) for selected
values of "set" in millimeters with the following output (Table E17-4) for plotting curves of set
versus P11 and number of blows N/cm versus fs as in Fig. E17-4. Note again that it is necessary to
use the set in centimeters (cm) to obtain meaningful values—that is, divide by mm but multiply by
10. Since this step is equivalent to using centimeters we should call it that.
Notes.

1. We must initialize Pu to start computations. I used Pu = 900 kN.
2. We must use the pile area as the area of steel (0.00602 m2), since the pipe must be filled with
concrete after it is driven.
3. Adequate convergence is taken as 10 kN. That is, the difference between computed and used P11
is not over 10 kN.
4. You can use program FFACTOR (Hiley option 12) for these computations.

17-9 GENERAL COMMENTS ON PILE DRIVING
Alignment of piles can be difficult to get exactly correct, and often the driven piles are not
exactly located in plan. A tolerance of 50 to 100 mm is usually considered allowable. Larger
deviations may require additional substructure design to account for eccentricities, or more
piles may have to be driven. Alignment of pipe piles may be checked by lowering a light into
the tube. If the light source disappears, the alignment is not true. Pile groups should be driven
from the interior outward because the lateral displacement of soil may cause excessively hard
driving and heaving of already driven piles.
Damage to piles may be avoided or reduced by squaring the driving head with the energy
source. Appropriate pile-driving caps and/or cushions should be used. When the required
driving resistance is encountered, driving should be stopped. These driving resistances may
be arbitrarily taken as

Timber piles 4-5 blows/25 mm
Concrete piles 6-8 blows/25 mm
Steel piles 12-15 blows/25 mm

Driving may require corrective action if the head of a timber pile becomes damaged; e.g.,
use a cap or metal band or cut the head of the pile more carefully. If during driving any pile
changes direction, or the penetration becomes irregular or suddenly increases, the pile may
already be broken or bent. Damaged piles will have to be pulled; pulling a broken timber pile
is not a trivial task—particularly the lower broken part.
Pile driving may induce heave in saturated, fine-grained, non-quick-draining soils, where
the displaced soil increases the pore water pressure so that the void ratio cannot rapidly
change. As the pore pressure dissipates, the amount of heave may be reduced. Piles already
driven in this material may be uplifted, the problem being especially aggravated if the piles
are closely spaced [Klohn (1961)]. The problem may or may not be serious, depending on
how the heave takes place [Nordlund (1962)], and may be more serious for point-bearing
piles if they are driven to refusal and then heave takes place, since excessive settlements
may result after the structure is built as the piles reseat themselves under load. If heave is
anticipated, survey benchmarks should be established, and elevations taken on the piles after
they are driven and as other piles are driven in the vicinity.
Since heave is caused by volume displacement, it can be somewhat controlled by us-
ing small-volume displacement piles (HP or open-end pipes). Heave can be controlled by
predrilling an undersized hole for timber and closed-end pipe piles to reduce the volume
displacement.
In granular soils a rearrangement of the soil structure from the driving vibrations may result
in a subsidence of the adjacent area. Already driven piles may be preloaded to some extent
by this phenomenon. A pile driven in a zone within about three pile diameters of an already
driven pile will be more difficult to drive because the soil in this zone will be densified.


Continuity of cast-in-place piles is verified by computing the volume of concrete used to
fill the pile cavity and comparing this with the theoretical cavity volume.

18-1 SINGLE PILES VERSUS PILE GROUPS
The preceding two chapters have considered the soil and structural aspects of single piles
in some detail together with a brief discussion of pile-driving operations. Rarely, however,
is the foundation likely to consist of a single pile. Generally, there will be a minimum of
two or three piles under a foundation element or footing to allow for misalignments and other
inadvertent eccentricities. Building codes1 may stipulate the minimum number of piles under
a building element. The load capacity, settlement, and individual pile loads associated with
pile groups are the concern of this chapter. Figure 18-1 presents some typical pile clusters,
for illustrative purposes only, since the designer must make up the group geometry to satisfy
any given problem.

18-2 VERTICALLY LOADED PILE GROUPS
When several piles are clustered, it is reasonable to expect that the soil pressures produced
from either side friction or point bearing will overlap as idealized in Fig. 18-2. The super-
imposed pressure intensity will depend on both the pile load and spacing, and if sufficiently
large the soil will fail in shear or the settlement will be excessive. The stress intensity from
overlapping stressed zones will obviously decrease with increased pile spacing s; however,
large spacings are often impractical since a pile cap is cast over the pile group for the column
base and/or to spread the load to the several piles in the group.

JThe Chicago Building Code (Sec. 13-132-120) states: "A column or pier supported by piles shall rest on not less
than three piles..."

Here D = pile diameter; H = diagonal of rectangular shape or HP pile. The BOCA code also
stipulates that spacing for friction piles in loose sand or loose sand-gravels shall be increased
10 percent for each interior pile to a maximum of 40 percent. Optimum spacing s seems to
be on the order of 2.5 to 3.5D or 2 to 3H for vertical loads; for groups carrying lateral and/or
dynamic loads, larger pile spacings are usually more efficient. Maximum pile spacings are
not given in building codes, but spacings as high as 8 or 10Z) have been used on occasion.

18-3 EFFICIENCY OF PILE GROUPS
When several pile butts are attached to a common structural element termed a pile cap the
result is a pile group. A question of some concern is whether the pile group capacity is the sum
of the individual pile capacities or something different—either more or less. If the capacity
is the sum of the several individual pile contributions, the group efficiency Eg = 1.0.
There are mixed opinions on pile group efficiency defined as

F - Qo
8 ~ XQ

P
where Q0 — group capacity as measured, kN or kips
XQp = sum of individual pile capacities of group, kN or kips

None of the building codes seen by the author (including those just cited) provides guid-
ance on group efficiency. The ASCE Committee on Deep Foundations report [CDF (1984)]


recommends not using group efficiency as a description of group action. This committee
report was a synthesis of work from 1963 to its publication date, so it is probably a very
realistic guideline. It suggests that friction piles in cohesionless soils at the usual spacings s
of s = 2 to 3D will have a group efficiency Eg > 1. The reason given is that in cohesionless
soil the pile displacement + driving vibrations increase the soil density (or ys) in a zone in
the vicinity of the pile, which is further increased as other piles are driven nearby.
For friction piles in cohesive soils the block shear + point bearing of the group in plan is
used as the group capacity, but in no case is the group capacity to be considered greater than
the single pile capacity times the number of piles in the group. The block bearing capacity
should only be included if the cap is in ground contact. If it is above the ground, the group
capacity may be the block perimeter shear + the individual point capacities. When the cap
is in contact with the ground it will settle with the soil since the piles will also settle that
amount. Thus, the bearing capacity is that of a block the size of the cap.
The pile practice survey by Focht and O'Neill (1985) indicated essentially that the CDF
recommendations were being used. About 6 percent used group spacing in group efficiency
and about 30 percent considered Eg if a block shear failure controlled.
At present the Converse-Labarre equation [see Moorhouse and Sheehan (1968)], which at
one time was widely used to compute group efficiency, is seldom used. The AASHTO (1990)
bridge specifications still give it as a "suggestion" for friction piles. The Converse-Labarre
equation is
Eg = i-e(n-l)m + {m-l)n (i8-i)
5 90mn
where m, n, and D are shown on Fig. 18-3 and 6 = tan"1 D/s in degrees. This equation is
limited to rectangular groups with identifiable values ofmXn.
Recently Sayed and Bakeer (1992) introduced an efficiency equation of the form

where Qs = shaft friction resistance for each pile in group, kN or kips
Qp = point load for each pile in group, kN or kips

n = No. of rows

Tj' = geometric efficiency parameter, which can be computed using an equation
similar to Eq. (18-1) giving values generally in the range of 0.6 to 2.5
K = group interaction factor (also to be estimated); ranges from 0.4 to about 9.0

For end-bearing piles the X Qs term is zero, giving Eg = 1 in Eq. (18-la), which is, of
course, the correct value. For other piles there is a lot of estimation (guessing) involved so
Eq. (18-lfl) should be used most cautiously, if at all.
When a concrete pile cap is poured directly on the ground, as is the most common case,
the group capacity is at least the block capacity based on the shear around the perimeter of
the group defined by the plan dimensions + the bearing capacity of the block dimension
at the pile points. The only exception is point bearing piles founded in rock where the group
capacity would be the sum of the individual point capacities.
When the pile cap is above ground, as is common for offshore structures, the group capacity
will be the lesser of the following:

1. The smaller of the block capacity based on the group perimeter (see distance L\ of Fig.
18-3) or the sum of the several pile perimeters making up the group. In either case the
sum of the bearing capacity of the pile points is added. The group perimeter will be equal
to the sum of the pile perimeters and for square piles, s/D > Jn + 1; for round piles,
s/D ^ 0.7854^1+ 1.
2. Sum of the capacity of the individual piles. This usually controls for large s/D ratios.

There are very few full-scale pile group load tests reported in the literature. Vesic (1977)
reported the results of five group load tests in clay and all gave an Eg ~ 1. Six full-scale load
tests in sands gave Eg > 1. There are a large number of model group tests such as Barden and
Monckton (1970); however, because of scale effects they are not considered to be reliable.
Vesic (1969^) reported on a series of vertically loaded group load tests using 100-mm
diameter piles 1800 mm in length in sand. The groups consisted of four and nine piles. In the
four-pile groups the vertical load was evenly distributed among the four piles; in the nine-pile
group the interior pile carried a larger load than the corners (which carried the least) and the
sides (which were intermediate). If we denote the interior pile as 100 percent efficient, then
the corners carry about 60 to 70 percent of the interior and the side piles about 80 percent.

Example 18-1. Compute the efficiency of the group of friction piles shown in Fig. El8-1 by the
Converse-Labarre equation [Eq. (18-1)] and using the CDF recommendation. Take D = 400 mm
and spacing s = 1000 mm (both ways) and all cohesionless material in the pile embedment zone.

Solution, By inspection of Fig. El 8-1 we see that m = 5 and n = 3.
6 = tan"1 D/s = tan"1 (400/1000) = 21.8°

Figure E18-1


Directly substituting into Eq. (18-1), we find

Eg = 1 ~ 2 L 8 ( 3 " 1 9 0 ( 5 ) ( ( 3 ) " 1 ) 3 = ° - 6 4 o r 64 percent
Group capacity: Qg = NpQpEg = 150,(0.64)
By CDF recommendations (s = 1 m = 2.5D is in "usual" range of spacings)
Group capacity = at least 15 X single pile capacity.

Example 18-2. Assume the pile group of Example 18-1 is in a clay soil for which the undrained
shear strength c = su = qu/2 = 30 kPa. The piles are 20 m in length (average). Estimate the
ultimate group capacity guit and assume there is a 250-mm cap projection beyond the outer piles.

Solution. This computation is for "block" capacity. Note pile diam. = 400 mm. Then the cap di-
mensions are these:
L = 4 x 1 + 2 X (0.200 + 0.250) = 4.9 m
5 = 2 X 1 + 2X (0.200 + 0.250) = 2.9 m
L - 4'9 - 1 7
B " 1 9 "
f = Y9 =6'9>4 UseiVc = 9-°
Block perimeter = 2(4.9 + 2.9) = 15.6 m Block area Ab = 4.9 X 2.9 = 14.21 m2
Take a = 0.6 from Fig. 16-14 using the API curve (soil-to-soil), but remember that driving of
exterior piles 250 mm interior from cap edge may remold soil. Then
Quit = 9cAb + block shear Block shear = asu(perimeter) (length)
= 9(30)(14.21) + 0.6(30)( 15.6)(20)
= 3807 + 5616 = 9423 kN
Load for single pile = acM(perimeter)L + point bearing
Pu = 0.6(30)(TT X 0.400)(20) + 9(30)(0.7854 X 0.4002)
= 452 + 34 = 486 kN/pile
For 15 piles gult = 15 X 486 = 7290 kN
Use Quit = 7290 kN although the apparent Eg = 9423/7290 = 1 . 3 .

18-4 STRESSES ON UNDERLYING STRATA
FROM PILES
The soil stresses on underlying strata produced by the several piles in a group are often re-
quired to make a strength or settlement estimate. These stresses are difficult to estimate for
several reasons:
1. Influence of pile cap—usually in direct contact with ground except on expansive soils.
This results in both the cap and the pile carrying the load with the interaction highly
indeterminate.
2. The distribution of friction effects along the pile, which are generally not known; hence
point load is also not known.


Figure 18-4 Simplified computation of soil stresses beneath a pile group: (a) friction piles; (b) alternative method for stress
computations for friction piles; (c) point-bearing piles.

3. The overlap of stresses from adjacent piles, which is difficult to evaluate.
4. The influence of driving the piles on the adjacent soil.
5. Time-dependent effects such as consolidation, thixotropy, varying loads, and change in
groundwater level.

Considering all these variables, it is common practice to simplify the stress computations,
as illustrated in Fig. 18-4. For friction piles two cases may be considered. In case 1 (Fig.
18-4a) the load is assumed to spread from a fictitious rigid footing located at the top of the
layer providing friction resistance at a 2:1 slope (or 30°). For a homogeneous stratum this is
the ground surface. In case 2 the load is placed on a fictitious rigid footing located at Lp/3
from the bottom of the piles (average depth), with Lp as in Fig. 18-4&. The spread-out of
load is also taken at either 2:1 or 30°. Case 1 or 2 should be used, whichever gives the larger
computed stresses on underlying strata. Blanchet et al. (1980) report that this method is not
very good for computing settlements and that an elastic solution might be preferred.
For point-bearing piles (case 3) in dense sand or sand-gravel deposits, the fictitious footing
is placed on the deposit in which the piles penetrate. Again, the load is spread at a 2:1 or 30°
slope, as shown in Fig. 18-4c.
These analyses are necessary to avoid overstressing the underlying strata. They are also
necessary to compute immediate settlements on loose granular deposits or consolidation set-
tlements in clay deposits. As can be seen, a pile group either transmits the load throughout a
soil mass of depth Lp for friction piles or to the full depth for an end-bearing pile. The soil
at or below these depths must carry the load without excessive deformation, or the load must
be transmitted to deeper strata.
An analytical method of computing the stresses—and resulting settlements—in the strata
underlying a pile group uses the author's extension of a method based on the Mindlin (19366)
solution, developed into a computer-programmable format by Geddes (1966), of a point load
at the interior of an elastic solid. As with the Boussinesq analysis, this method assumes the soil
is semi-infinite, isotropic, homogeneous, and elastic. Soil does not usually fit these assump-

tions; thus, the solutions are in error, but they should be as good as the Boussinesq solution,
which is widely used for footing settlements.
Geddes (1969) later made solutions for the Boussinesq case for subsurface loadings. These
are generally less accurate than the Mindlin solution. Poulos and Davis (1968) also used the
Mindlin solution to predict settlements. Instead of presenting tables of stress coefficients, they
presented charts for settlement-influence factors. Either the Geddes or the Poulos and Davis
solutions should provide the same deflection if properly used, since they are both based on the
Mindlin solution. The Geddes solution is included since one can easily compute deflections
from stresses, but stresses are not so easily back-computed from deflections; stresses may be
needed for consolidation settlements.
Geddes developed three cases, as shown in Fig. 18-5. As with the Boussinesq analysis, it
is convenient to use stress coefficients that can be evaluated on an electronic computer. Four
stresses can be evaluated for each case (vertical, shear, radial, and circumferential). For case
1 the vertical stress is

likely form in this zone, because gravity effects would produce a downward flow of the soil
mass to eliminate them. The inclusion of potential tension stresses would, however, implicitly
include the soil weight, so computed settlements would be in error. Only compressive soil
stresses in the strata below the soil tip cause settlement, although the pile cap settlement is
actually the sum of both point settlement and elastic axial pile shaft deformation, which can
be computed in the form of es = \'PuLp/AE. Also it was necessary to use n = 0.002+ when
programming the case 2 and case 3 table output, since n = 0.0 would produce a discontinuity
(divide-by-zero error) in the computations.
Table 18-1 lists values for Kz for various m = z/D and n = r/D values and three selected
values of Poisson's ratio /x for all three cases. By superposition of effects, these three cases
should provide a general solution for the vertical stress at a point for any reasonable type of
stress distribution along a pile. To avoid interpolation use your program FFACTOR (option
11) for any of these 3 skin resistance cases.
This procedure is recommended to obtain a vertical stress profile for making consolidation
(or elastic) settlement computations in the soil below the pile tips. As the following example
illustrates, the "conventional" method, although quite simple, may substantially underesti-
mate (assuming the theory of a load on the interior of a semi-infinite elastic solid is valid) the
soil stress at a point. Unfortunately there are few pile group settlements measured and almost
no stress measurements taken below pile groups to verify any theory.

Example 18-3. Compute the vertical stress at a point A of the four-pile group shown in Fig. El 8-3.
Take fi = 0.3. Compare the results with what has been the conventional method of analysis.

Solution.
Step 1. Assume point-loaded piles.

r = 0.610 V2 = 0.863 m
-^-IS-"»
From Table 18-1« [actually using program FFACTOR (option H)] with input: r = 0.863, L = 16.8,
/JL = 0.3, case 1, z = 18.3 ~> Kz = -12.41.

Step 2. Assume one-half of load carried by point and one-half carried by friction, as in result 1
preceding. For point,

For constant variation of skin friction (case 2) and using program FFACTOR, we find that

Step 3. By conventional analysis, what is stress at A? Use Fig. \S-4b.
H = —-— = 5.6 m (above pile tip)
Therefore, depth to A = 5.6 + 1.5 = 7.1 m and (using 2V to IH); total cap load = 2000 kN

This compares with 86 kPa for point-load conditions and 50 kPa for one-half point, one-half skin
friction. A possible value is a = (87 + 50 + 29)/3 = 50 kPa.

18-5 SETTLEMENTS OF PILE GROUPS
The settlement of a pile group is exactly equal to the displacement of the pile point plus
the elastic shortening of the pile shaft between cap and point as illustrated in Fig. 18-6.
For point-bearing piles the point displacement is relatively small and the principal displace-
ment is the elastic shortening of the pile. For friction piles the point displacement will be the

uating the elastic shortening of the pile. In both cases the point-deflection computation is a considerable exercise
in engineering judgment.

significant quantity causing settlement. Note, however, that the total point displacement is
due to both point load and settlement of the underlying soil from stresses from shaft friction
or arealfill or ground subsidence. The group settlement involves the following:

1. The problem of obtaining the stresses in the strata below the point and the correct elastic
properties of those soils so that the point displacement can be computed. Currently the
only practical means is to use some type of Boussinesq or Mindlin solution of Sec. 18-4.
2. The determination of the load carried by the piles in the group and the distribution of the
load along the pile shaft so that the axial shortening can be computed. Vesic (1969a) found
that when a pile group consists of more than just corner (3 and 4 pile groups) piles, the inte-
rior piles carry more load than side piles and corner piles carry less load than side piles. In
numerical perspective we might say that if interior piles carry P = 400 kN, then side piles
carry about 0.75 to 0.80P = 300 to 320 kN and corner piles about 0.6 to 0.7P = 240 to
280 kN. Now there is the question of whether this is a short-duration load test phenomenon
or exists some time after the pile group is in service. Since soil tends to creep under sus-
tained load, like concrete, it is reasonable to expect that the individual pile loads in a group
will tend to more nearly equalize under sustained loading (the design load). When load
equalization occurs, there are questions of how long it will take, whether the settlements
change, how—if at all—they are influenced by the pile cap rigidity, whether the pile cap
is in contact with the soil, and pile spacing. When the pile cap is above ground (or water
as for offshore structures), the pile loads can be estimated reasonably well. When the cap
is of concrete poured directly on the ground as is the usual case, except on expansive soil,
the pile load is considerably indeterminate. According to Broms (1972) the modulus of
elasticity of concrete piles is not a constant value but deteriorates with time as much as 10
percent. This decrease is not likely to affect the computations to any significant amount.
First, this change is somewhat speculative for reinforced piles because the transformed
section is rarely used. Second, concrete strength gradually improves with age.
This latter modulus reduction, if deemed valid, would also apply equally for wood. The
major problem for all pile materials is the distribution of load along the pile shaft.

To obtain the pile load (but not its distribution along the shaft—this must be estimated)
for an estimate of pile shortening under load, use your FADMAT program or similar and

For both:
AH = As+ Ap


input a composite value of ks for those mat elements contributing to computation of the soil
"spring" at the given pile locations. This method appears to be similar to that of Butterfield
and Banerjee (1971).
The composite ks would be obtained by computing the pile constant for compression (as in
Sec. 18-10), which may be of the form k'AE/L. The contributory area of the mat for the soil
"spring" at the node is obtained as Kt = ksab as in Fig. 18-7. The equivalent soil modulus is
computed by considering the pile and soil springs in parallel (as in Fig. 18-7£>) with the same
deflection to obtain
X'AF
ksabX + —r-X = K1X (a)

from which the equivalent spring K' = ksab + A'AE/L.
The equivalent composite soil modulus at that node is K's = K'/ab. The computer output
will give the total nodal force K'X, which can be separated into the pile and soil components
using Eq. (a) above. Obviously, the solution will be only as good as the soil parameter ks and
the pile constant. The A' term used in X'PL/AE is to make allowance for the type of pile and
distribution of skin resistance. In any case the computer solution will give values of relative
effects that may be useful in estimating pile-group response.
Larger pile groups should settle more than small groups for the same pile loads owing to
the overlapping effect of stresses below the pile point from the additional piles. In addition

to the overlap effect the outer piles cause stresses to penetrate to a greater depth L\ such that

produces a larger deflection beneath the pile group.
It is usual (but usually not correct) to assume that the pile cap is rigid so that the cap
movements can be described by rigid body translations and rotations.
Pile groups supported by clay soils may produce both elastic (or immediate) and consolida-
tion settlements. The elastic settlements may be the major amount for preconsolidated clays;
the consolidation settlements may be the principal value(s) for normally consolidated clays
using friction or floating piles. The stress coefficients of Table 18-1 may be used to estimate
the stress increase causing consolidation settlements using Eq. (5-22) for Aq and Eq. (2-44)
or its equivalent for AH.
Pile groups supported by cohesionless soils will produce only immediate-type settlements,
the principal problems being to obtain the correct evaluation of the stress increase in the un-
derlying strata, the depth Lx through which the stress increase acts, and the elastic properties
so that Eq. (5-16a) or simply

S = ^ - (18-8)
Es
can be used to obtain the downward point movement 8.
There are two basic approaches to computing pile-group settlements: empirical and theo-
retical. Either method involves estimating the settlement of a single pile AHpt using one or
another of the methods given in Sec. 16-10.
The pile-group settlement AHg is usually larger than that obtained for a single pile (either
computed or measured). In a general form, the group settlement of n piles is related to the
settlement of a single pile as
AH8 = FagnAHpt (18-9)
where ag = a group interaction factor usually in the range of 0.3 to 0.7 (before any adjust-
ment) with larger values for small numbers of piles n or small s/D spacing ratios; ag is smaller
for end-bearing piles, for large s/D or n, or if a very stiff layer (or rock) is in close proximity
to the pile point. The pile length/width (Lp/D) ratio also modifies the group settlement, and
we might obtain F values from the following table:

Adjustment factor
LpiD F

5 0.75
10 0.80
100 1.25

The adjustment factor F is also dependent on the spacing ratio s/D. A theoretical approach
originating with Dr. H. Poulos and his coworkers at the University of Sydney, Australia [see
Poulos (1979)], gives Eq. (18-9) in the following slightly different form. This form uses
single-pile settlement based on a unit load AH'pt with an average pile load in the group of P1
to obtain


Poulos (1979) provides a number of tables and curves from which one can obtain a'g =
function of (Lp/D, s/D, E5, JJL, Hstratum/Lp). In most cases some interpolation will be required.
This approach—while theoretical—requires soil properties that are usually "best estimates."
Most engineers prefer simpler methodologies if the end result is only an estimate. For this
reason several more simple methods are given here.
Vesic (1969a, 1977)—and others—have suggested computing the settlement of a pile
group using using the settlement of a single pile as
AHg = AHpt JB/D (units of AHpt) (18-10)

where B = least lateral group dimension, m or ft, and
D = pile diameter or effective width (and as used for the spacing ratio s/D), m or ft.

Here the F • ag • n terms of Eq. (18-9) have been combined into a single group factor in Eq.
(18-10) as
F -ag-n = JB/D (18-1Oa)
Equation (18-10) is suggested for use by NAVAC (1982&), but only for cohesionless soils.
Based on testing large-scale group models containing four and nine piles in sand, Vesic
(1969a) found that using the group amplification factor of JB/D gave a scatter of about
±50 percent.
Meyerhof (1976) gives some empirical equations for the settlement of pile groups AHg
using in situ penetration test data (usually about all that is available for many projects). He
computes the settlement of a single pile similarly to the settlement of a shallow spread footing
(adjusted for depth), so an estimate of the intensity of the vertical stress Aq at the pile tip is
required. For a pile group a modification of Eq. (18-10a) is used, so the pile group width B
(which is dependent on the s/D ratio) must be computed.
We can approximately derive Meyerhof's (1976) equation for the standard penetration test
(SPT) as follows: Meyerhof (1956) gives quXt = N55B, ft/10 (tons/ft2), which in SI becomes
9uit = ^55By m/0.0318 (kPa). It is usual to assume that the ultimate bearing pressure qu\t
occurs at a settlement of AH = 25 mm (1 in.). Meyerhof (1956) also suggested a depth
factor = 1 + 0.33Lp/D < 1.33. Meyerhof and others later found that this equation predicts
qu\t about 50 percent too low. Making these adjustments, and using pile diameter or width D
for footing width B, we obtain the ultimate bearing pressure as
quit = ^ § ^ 1 3 3 x 1-5 = 62.77V55A kPa (a)
Now for the actual pile point stress Aq, we can make a ratio to give the point settlement as
A f l ^ m m A<?,kPa A__ 25Aq
25, mm ^uit,kPa 62.1N55D
If we assume that Aq should be about 25 percent larger than the actual point bearing to allow
for a skin resistance contribution, we can simplify Eq. (b) above to

(c)

(18-9a)


Using the group factor of Eq. (18-10) of Fg = JB/D in Eq. (c) to amplify single-pile settle-
ment to a group value gives

AHg = AHp[Fg = A 2 ^ , m m (18-11)

Meyerhof's original form of Eq. (18-11) was in Fps units and did not include the D-term
(he used D = 1). The above form should be used with SI units. Other terms are defined
following:
B = pile-group width (and indirectly includes the s/D spacing ratio), m
(you must use meters in this equation)
Aq = vertical pressure at pile tip (do not include any skin resistance
contribution, as it was done in the simplification), kPa

Jti = 1 - ^ > 0.5 (Lp = pile length)—see Eq. (18-12)
OJD
N55 = average SPT N55 value in the zone from about group width B
above to 2B below the pile tips
For the cone penetration test (CPT) we can estimate settlement of a pile group as

^H8 = ^ ~ - (u n it s of g r o u p W id t h B) (18-12)

Use Aq, qc in the same pressure units, and other terms are defined with Eq. (18-11). Obtain
an average qc for Eq. (18-12) using the same pile tip zone as used to obtain the average N55
used in Eq. (18-11).
The Focht and O'Neill (1985) pile survey reported that only about 18 percent of the respon-
dents used the elastic settlement procedures as given in Poulos (1979) and earlier. The other
82 percent are using a variety of procedures—or nothing at all. The author has not included
Poulos's methodology since it is essentially based on the Mindlin solution. The methodol-
ogy presented here is more fundamental and gives the user some control over the analysis as
illustrated in the previous examples and in the following example.

Example 18-4. One of the better-reported series of building and pile settlements available in
geotechnical literature was made by Koerner and Partos (1974). From these data the soil profile and
typical pile cap on two columns are shown in Fig. E18-4.
Other data: Pile load = 1070 kN (approx.)
Pile length = 7.62 m (cased and enlarged base)
Pile diameter = 406 mm /c' = 35 mPa
Es = 27.57 MPa (doubled by Koerner and Partos to allow for
increased density)
s = 2JD
Measured settlements 38 to 84 mm with an average AH = 65 mm

Required. Estimate settlement of a typical pile cap.

Solution. There are a number of ways to estimate settlement values for this building including Eq.
(18-9). We will look at two of them. First we will need to find the point displacement, which is done
as follows:

Step 1. Use Table 18-Ic, case 3, since a load test indicates very little point movement for a working
load of 1070 kN indicating the principal load mechanism must be skin resistance. Assume /JL = 0.3.
Lp = 7.62 m s = 2.7D = 1.0962 m
take r = I
n = = ' = 0.072 (use 0.06 to avoid interpolation)
Lp 2(7.62)
With this n and several m = z/Lp values we obtain the following table for Kz at a point midway
between the two piles beneath the cap:

zlLp Kz
1.0 3.46
1.1 2.31
1.2 1.25
1.3 0.79

1.6 0.34
1.7 0.28
1.8 0.23
1.9 0.20
2.0 0.17

The average influence value in the zone Lp to 2LP using the trapezoidal rule is

Step 2. Compute the average stress in depth Lp below pile and the corresponding settlement.
Assume stress only from the two piles:
_ 2PK^ _ 2(107Q)(0.82) _
a - — ^ ^ 1 30.2 kPa

The point settlement based on E5 = 190 kPa is
A__ aL 30.2(7.62)

which compares reasonably well with the value of 5.3 or 5.6 measured in the load test.

Method 1. Total settlement is settlement of cap plus point movement just computed. Use Eq.
(5-16a) for cap settlement.
B = 0.686 m L = 2.185 m (both given in reference)
E5 = 27.57 mPa (given)
Using Table 5-5 and N values given in the reference and weighting, one can obtain E5 = 14 300
kPa. We will therefore use an average since the value of 27 570 was arbitrarily doubled and may
be somewhat too large.

Total AH = A#cap + A#pile = 73.8 + 8.4 = 82.2 mm
This compares quite well with 63.5 to 83.8 mm measured.

Method 2. Settlement is computed as elastic shortening of pile + A//Piie point. For a linear variation

have


It is evident that, although this method is correct for the stated assumptions, the measured deflections
indicate something causing additional settlement. Probably the 1.22 m of fill is a major contributor.

18-6 PILE CAPS
Unless a single pile is used, a cap is necessary to spread the vertical and horizontal loads
and any overturning moments to all the piles in the group. The cap is usually of reinforced
concrete, poured on the ground unless the soil is expansive. Caps for offshore structures are
often fabricated from steel shapes. The pile cap has a reaction that is a series of concentrated
loads (the piles); and the design considers the column loads and moments, any soil overlying
the cap (if it is below the ground surface), and the weight of the cap. It was usual, before
the widespread use of personal computers and the availability of computer programs such as
FAD3DPG on your diskette or B-28 listed on your diskette, to make the following assump-
tions for a conventional pile cap design:

1. Each pile carries an equal amount of the load for a concentric axial load on the cap; or for
n piles carrying a total load Q, the load Pp per pile is

PP = ® (18-13)

2. The combined stress equation (assuming a planar stress distribution) is valid for a pile cap
noncentrally loaded or loaded with a load Q and a moment, as
Pp = Q± MA2 ± M^2 (18.14)
n 2L*2 2Ly2
where Mx, My = moments about x and y axes, respectively
x, y = distances from y and x axes to any pile
S *2> S y2 = moment of inertia of the group, computed as
/ = /o + Ad2
but the pile moment of inertia IQ is negligible, and the A term cancels, since it is the pile
load desired and appears in both the numerator and denominator of Eq. (18-14).

The assumption that each pile in a group carries an equal load may be nearly correct when
the following criteria are all met:

1. The pile cap is in contact with the ground.
2. The piles are all vertical.
3. Load is applied at the center of the pile group.
4. The pile group is symmetrical and the cap is very thick (or rigid), usually about 1.8 to
2+ m thick for plan dimensions of 2 to 3 m and depending on pile spacing.


In a practical case of a four-pile symmetrical group centrally loaded, each pile will carry
one-fourth of the vertical load regardless of cap rigidity (or thickness). With a fifth pile di-
rectly under the load, cap rigidity will be a significant factor.
The structural design of pile caps is only minimally addressed in the literature but the
following may be used as a guide:

1. Bending moments are taken at the same sections as for reinforced-concrete footings and
defined in Art. 15-4 of the ACI Code (and as given in Chap. 8).
2. Pile caps must be reinforced for both positive and negative bending moments. Reinforce-
ment should be placed so there is a minimum cover of 70 mm for concrete adjacent to
the soil. When piles extend into the cap only about 70 mm, the bottom cap reinforcement
should be 75 mm above the pile top to control concrete cracking around the pile head.
3. Pile caps should extend at least 150 mm beyond the outside face of exterior piles and
preferably 250 mm. When piles extend into the cap more than 75 mm, the bottom rebars
should loop around the pile to avoid splitting a part of the cap from pile head moments
and shears.
4. When pile heads are assumed fixed, they should extend into the pile cap at least 300 mm.
The minimum thickness of pile cap above pile heads is 300 mm (required by ACI 318- in
Art. 15-7).
5. Some kind of tension shear connectors should be used on the pile heads if the piles are
subjected to tension forces.
6. Pile cap shear is computed at critical sections as shown in Fig. 18-8.

ACI 318-.


Pile cap moments and shears for design are best obtained by using a FEM or a computer
program such as B-6 based on the finite-grid method (FGM), or, preferably, B-28. When
the cap load is at the centroid of both cap and group, the group is symmetrical, and the cap
load is vertical, any computer program for plates will give node moments with adequate
accuracy. The FGM can be used to obtain both the node moments and shears. In using these
programs one replaces (or adds the vertical pile spring) the soil spring at the nodes where
piles are located with a pile "spring" and produces a set of output. Since the pile spring is
usually several orders of magnitude larger than the soil springs in the soft soils where piles
are usually used, the model is not significantly improved by using soil springs at all nodes
and with soil and pile springs in parallel at the pile nodes.
When there are battered piles and/or additional load degrees of freedom, one must use
a special program to obtain a correct pile cap solution. This problem is considered in more
detail in Sec. 18-11. In three- and four-pile groups centrally loaded with a vertical load, cap
flexibility is not a factor as each pile carries P/n, where n = the three or four piles in the group.
When there are more piles than this—particularly both interior and exterior—cap flexibility is
a significant factor; e.g., in a centrally loaded five-pile group with four exterior and one central
pile the central pile will carry most of the load until the cap becomes very rigid (thick). In a
long-term case, the pile loads might tend to even out somewhat; however, the piles must be
designed to support worst-case loading even if it is transient.

18-7 BATTER PILES
When large lateral loads are to be resisted by a pile group, it has been a common practice
to use piles driven at a slope with the vertical, i.e., batter piles. It has also been common to
assume that the batter piles carry all the lateral loads. All piles have some lateral load-carrying
ability dependent on the pile width, the flexural rigidity (EI) of the pile, and the stiffness of
the soil in which they are embedded. Early methods of pile-group analysis with both vertical
and lateral loads were primarily graphical. These early methods also assumed that the piles
were axially loaded, which precluded bending moments being developed. From combining
graphical solutions and the assumptions of axial loading, it naturally followed that the lateral
loads had to be carried by batter piles.
Modern methods of pile-group analysis use the computer, and additionally lateral pile-
load tests have verified what the computer solutions illustrate, namely, that all the piles in a
group carry lateral load. The graphical solutions are no longer used, since they are obviously
incorrect. The computer method of group analysis, being the only practical way of analyzing
a group, is the only method presented in this chapter.
Common pile batters range from J12 (1 horizontal to 12 vertical) to /J12. When the batter
exceeds /J4, the driving may require special equipment, with resulting increased costs.
18-8 NEGATIVE SKIN FRICTION
When a fill is placed on a compressible soil deposit, consolidation of the compressible mate-
rial will occur. When a pile is driven through (or into) the compressible material (either before
or after fill placement) before consolidation is complete, the soil will move downward relative
to the pile. This relative movement will develop skin friction between the pile and the moving
soil termed negative skin friction. According to measurements reported by Bjerrum et al.
(1969), Bozozuk (1972), and Bozozuk et al. (1979), the negative skin friction can exceed the


allowable load for pile sections. Fellenius (1972) has also reported large values of measured
negative skin resistance.
The principal effect of negative skin resistance is to increase the axial load in the lower
fixed portion of the pile. It may result also in increased pile settlements due to the axial
shortening and/or additional point penetration of the pile under the increased axial load. Note
that in Fig. 18-9 the fill settlement may be such that a gap forms between the bottom of the
pile cap and the soil. This will transfer the full cap weight to the piles and may change the
bending stresses in the cap.
Negative skin friction can produce large tension stresses when the effect is from expan-
sive soils—especially if no, or insufficient, gap is left between soil and pile cap and the soil
expands against both the pile and the cap.
Negative skin friction can be developed from the following:

1. A cohesive fill placed over a cohesionless soil deposit. The fill develops shear resistance
(adhesion) between the soil and pile from lateral pressure/flow effects, so that the pile,
is pushed downward as the fill consolidates. Little effect is produced in the underlying
cohesionless soil except that the weight of fill increases the lateral pressure. This provides
additional skin resistance against further pile penetration and raises the center of resistance
nearer the cohesive fill for point-bearing piles.
2. A cohesionless fill placed over a compressible, cohesive deposit. In this case there will be
some downdrag in the fill zone, but the principal downdrag will occur in the zone of consol-
idation. For point-bearing piles any settlement of the group will be due to axial shortening
of the pile. For floating piles, additional penetration with matching settlement will occur
unless the pile is sufficiently long that the bottom portion can develop enough positive
skin resistance to balance the additional load developed by negative (or downward) skin

resistance. In this case an approximation of the location of the balance, or neutral, point
can be made.
3. Lowering of the groundwater table with resulting ground subsidence.
4. Pile-driving (and load-test) operations that produce negative stresses in the upper shaft
when the load is released and the pile shaft expands upward. The resulting slip and nega-
tive skin resistance must be balanced by a positive skin resistance in the lower shaft and/or
point load [Vesic (1977)].

For negative skin resistance forces to develop significantly, a portion of the pile must be
fixed against vertical movement, such as the point being on rock or the lower part being
in a dense sand. If the entire pile moves down with the consolidation effect no negative skin
resistance forces develop. For a single pile the negative skin resistance force can be estimated
as follows:

1. For cohesive fill overlying cohesionless soils as in Fig. \S-9a:

Pnf = ( ' a'p'qKdz (18-15)
Jo
where a' = coefficient relating the effective lateral pressure qK to the shearing resistance
about the pile perimeter; a' = tanS where S = 0.5 to 0.9$; su is replaced by
qK as this is somewhat of a drained case
p' = pile perimeter
K = lateral earth-pressure coefficient; use K = K0 = 1 - sin </>
q = effective overburden pressure at any depth z

Equation (18-12) could be written using the equivalent of fs from any of Eqs. (16-14) to
obtain the /3 method, which may be more reliable than the a method of Eq. (18-13) [see
Indraratna et al. (1992)]. That is,
(Lf
Pnf = rfiqdz
Jo
where r = reduction factor ranging from about 0.5 to 1.0.
2. For cohesive soil underlying cohesionless fill take the origin of coordinates at the bottom
of the fill (see Fig. 18-96):

Pnf = a'p'qKdz (18-16)
Jo
Below the neutral point (refer to Fig. 18-10), if there is one, positive friction is developed
to the bottom of effective pile length L:
fL
P Pf = a'2p'qKdz + Pnp (18-17)
where Pnp = amount of negative skin resistance carried by the point where point-bearing
piles are used and other terms as previously defined.
Note that the general form of q is

Also it may be necessary to adjust the integration limits if the soil is stratified to obtain a
summation of negative skin contributions.
If we take a' = a'2, and a floating pile where Pnp = 0, and if we equate Eqs. (18-16) and
(18-17) after integration for the limits shown, we obtain

The Pnp term of Fig. (18-10) requires estimation for either point-bearing piles or where
it may be substantial for floating piles. The most recent attempt to refine the location of the
neutral point and obtain a general quantification of the negative skin resistance is that of
Matyas and Santamarina (1994). This work is not presented because in the author's opinion
there are too many estimations (both yield and working load side and point displacements and
point capacities—five values to estimate). From their work, however, it does appear that the
neutral point is somewhere between L/2 and L/3 (of Fig. 18-10) measured upward from the
pile point. The L/3 point seems particularly applicable when the point carries a substantial
part of the design load.
If you have enough load test data to compute the neutral point directly, this method is
preferable—but seldom likely to be carried out because of the expense. Alternatively, you
might compute the neutral point using Eq. (18-18) and see where it locates along shaft zone
L. Then arbitrarily compute the estimated axial load to this neutral point and also at depths of
about 0.6L and 0.67L down the shaft length L. If the pile shaft can carry these loads using an
SF on the order of 2 to 3, it is adequately sized. If the shaft is overstressed, then use a slightly
larger pile cross section.
When the piles are spaced at small s/D ratios, the negative friction force may act effectively
on the block perimeter rather than on the individual piles to obtain two modes of stressing
requiring investigation:

1. The total group negative skin resistance as the sum from the individual piles,

Qn =^Pnf (18-19)

2. The "block" skin resistance based on shear resistance on the block perimeter H- weight of
block trapped between the piles,
Qn = fsLfP'g + yLfA (18-20)

where y = unit weight of soil enclosed in pile group to depth Lf
A = area of pile group enclosed in perimeter p'g (Fig. 18-9c)
fs = a'qK = effective skin resistance on the group perimeter
p'g = perimeter of pile group

The maximum from Eq. (18-19) or (18-20) should be used for the estimate of the nega-
tive skin resistance that could be developed. Some evidence exists [Baligh et al. (1978),
Indraratna et al. (1992)] that coating the pile shaft downdrag zone with a special bitumen
mixture will substantially reduce the negative skin friction force.

Example 18-5. Estimate the negative skin-friction effect for the pile group shown in Fig. E18-5.
The group is square and the piles are driven through the fill after it has been placed and while the
underlying soil is still in a consolidating state. The CD angle of internal friction of the fill is assumed
as shown.

Solution. We will use Eq. (18-14) to obtain the single-pile increase:

(after integration)

Check the alternative possibility of block loading of the piles using Eq. (18-20). Take the effective
perimeter of the group based on center-to-center pile spacing:

= 85 + 396 = 481 kN
The increase per pile is 481/9 = 53 > 20 kN and controls.
There is no certainty that the s/D is such as to allow this latter negative resistance to develop, but
one will be on the safe side to assume this increase is due to negative skin resistance in the absence
of a better limitation on s/D.

Example 18-6. Redo Example 18-5 as if the fill is only 1.5 m deep and the underlying soil is a

18-9 LATERALLY LOADED PILE GROUPS
This topic has produced a quantity of conflicting literature—primarily concerning whether a
group of, say, four piles would displace more with a lateral group load Phg = 40 kN than a
single pile with a load Phs = 10 kN. For example, one case reported in the literature involved
a nine-pile group consisting of 2134-mm pipe piles with tw = 57 mm. The measured group
Sh8 — 135 mm versus a single pile 8hp « 40 mm. Ooi and Duncan (1994) report using a
nine-pile group with a rigid cap; pile spacing on the order of s/B = 3; and HP 250 X 63
(10 X 42) piles. It was given that the group load Phg = 9Phs = 400.5 kN produced a lateral
8hg = 3.4 mm, whereas a single pile with P5 = 44.5 kN had a Shp = 1.7 mm. Several other
lateral pile tests have reported similar ratios of 8hg/8hp.
Stating that a cap is "rigid" does not make it so, for pile cap computations including the
flexural rigidity (EI) of the cap indicate that a cap on the order of 2 to 3 m in plan has to be
between 1.8 and 2+ m thick—most caps are considered "rigid" if they are from 0.6 to 1 m
thick (see Sec. 18-6). If the cap is not truly rigid, in-plane plate distortion from both bending
and shear may be measured as a part of the cap displacement; for small displacements, the
percent error can be large, i.e., 1 mm in 4 mm is a 25 percent error.
There are only two tests reported in the literature (known to the author) in which one
can have confidence that "rigid" caps were indeed used: by Kim and Brungraber (1976) and
Beatty (1970). In both cases the caps were massive blocks of concrete. In the Kim-Brungraber
case the group displacement 8hg was about 50 percent of the single-pile displacement 5^. In
the Beatty case it was difficult to draw any conclusions since they tested two-pile and six-pile
groups. From two of the tests under nearly identical loading conditions—ground contact and
no passive resistance—the two-pile group when loaded to 180 kN had a lateral displacement

of S/& — 7.5 mm, whereas a six-pile group loaded with 960 kN had a 5 ^ ~ 29 mm. These
results give a pile-load ratio of 160/90 = 1 . 8 versus a displacement ratio of 29/7.5 = 3.9.
Apparently a laterally loaded pile group of n piles with the same nominal load per pile
(Ps = Pg/n) might displace more than a single pile under the same loading conditions—at
least for a pile spacing s to pile diameter D ratio (s/D) under about 6 to 8. There was some
discussion in Sec. 16-15 of the necessity of adjusting the soil modulus ks for spacing and
other factors for piles in a group. With the lateral displacement very dependent on ks it is
clear that there may be load shedding to adjacent piles to produce a group displacement that
is larger than for a single pile.
For the more common pile caps with both vertical and lateral load and poured directly on
the soil, the lateral displacement is usually quite small. In the Beatty case one of the caps
(no vertical load but with both ground friction and passive resistance developed) displaced
8hg = 1.2 mm versus approximately 29 mm for the same 960 kN load (with friction but no
passive resistance). When the pile cap has a vertical load the lateral displacement will include
a small P-A effect—that is, the lateral displacement will include a component for the lateral
load and an additional amount from the moment produced by the vertical load Pv X Sf1.
What sometimes causes a group of n piles to produce 8hg > Sy18 when using identical ap-
parent loadings, i.e., Ps and nPsl The group certainly has a much larger effective moment
of inertia (/piies + S Apd2). To answer this question partially, let us assume we have a sin-
gle fixed-head pile (set rotation NX = 1 to zero) and pile groups as follows (see also Fig.
18-llfl):
Case I: One HP 360 X 174 fixed head against rotation and P5 = 15 kN.
Case II: Two HP 360 X 174 driven flange in contact with flange so that the effective face
width bf = 0.378 and the moment of inertia Ig = 2 x 0.000508 + 2Ap(d/2)2 =
0.001 016 + 0.001447 = 0.002463 m4. Use a 2 X Ps = 30 kN load.
Case III: Two-pile group with piles side by side, I8 = 2 X 0.000 508 = 0.001016 m4. Use
30 kN load.
Case IV: Four-pile group—piles connecting both ways, giving a moment of inertia of 4 X
0.000508 + 4Apd2 = 0.0004925 m4. Use a 60 kN load (4 X 15).
Case V: Four-pile group, piles stacked front to rear so the width is that of one (1) flange
but a moment of inertia of 4 X 0.000508 + 2A\d\ + 2A2d\ = 0.01650 m4. Also
P8 = 60 kN.
Since the piles are grouped so that they can be visualized as a single laterally loaded pile,
you can use program FADBEMLP on your diskette. The base ks = Cm(600 + 125Z° 5 ). We
will use the following values (see Sec. 16-15.2) for Cm:

Case Cm Adjusted Cn,
I 2 1 + 2 x 0 . 5 = 2
II 2 1 + (0.457/2 X 0.378)075 = 1.69
III 2 1 + 4 X 0.5 = 3 (two extra sides)
IV 2 1.69 + 2 X 0.5 = 2.69 (two extra sides)
V 2 1 + 4 x 2 x 0 . 5 = 5 (front + 8 sides)

Looking at the tabulation of displacements for these several cases, we see that one should
"adjust" the size/shape factor Cm. Because of the group shape, it is clearly possible for group
displacements to be either larger or smaller than those for a single pile. The reader should
verify the computations for Cm for these five cases. The use of Cm = 2.0 is evidently valid
only for the single pile of Case I.
If we consider any laterally loaded pile as a cantilever beam fixed at some depth L'c in the
soil as in Fig. 18-11/?, the lateral displacement 8hp is nonlinear, as shown by the approximate
equations using Lnc shown on the figure. From structural analysis methods the lateral force
Ps produces a lateral displacement 8ps, which is reduced by the head fixity moment Mfh
effect of 8hm\ the lateral soil pressure qs also reduces the lateral displacement by an amount
8hs. The triangular lateral resisting pressure diagram should probably be closer to parabolic;
however, there is not much difference in the computed lateral displacement from either type
of pressure distribution. Both of these are as one would expect—data on the figure merely
quantify these displacements somewhat approximately.
Since the laterally loaded "effective" cantilever produces a nonlinear Sh, it is clear that
even if the soil behaves linearly the group displacement will not be linear except for special
cases.
The author did the foregoing analysis using ks values as shown on Fig. 18-1 Ia and also
for ks = 200 + 50Z0 5 . The displacements were considerably larger for the softer soil, but
the displacement ratios remained about the same. These analyses show that the group Ig is a
factor, but ks is a very significant factor. The pile groups used here have s'/D = 0, so each
pile carries Pg/m\ this statement may not be true where s'/D > 0 and we have different values
of Cm depending on the pile location in the group (front, corner, side, interior, rear). In any
group, however, and for whatever pile orientation the net horizontal component of pile head
displacement must be the same for every pile in the group unless the cap is not rigid and
undergoes in-plane distortions.
Poulos (1971) produced a number of nondimensional curves for several pile stiffness val-
ues and the preceding table is somewhat instructive in the validation of those curves. For the
two-pile case and interpolating for s/D = 0, we find his curves indicate the group displace-
ment 8hg/8hs should be about two times that of the single pile; but the author's ratio (and
considering Cm) gives a maximum of about Shg/Shs = 5.59/4.95 = 1.13, or, depending on
orientation, 4.80/4.95 = 0.97.
For the four-pile case with a 2 X 2 arrangement, apparently there would be a lateral in-
fluence of about 1 and a front-to-rear influence of 1, giving about 4 times the displacement,
which was computed as only 5.20/4.95 = 1.05. The Poulos influence curves give reductions,


not increases, for piles that are side by side at spacings of s/D = 2 and 5, which do not seem
correct.
Since some pile groups do apparently displace more than a single pile does that is similarly
configured and loaded for s'/D ratios in the range of 2 to about 5 or 6, there must be some
validity—particularly if the piles are not "fixed" to the pile cap—to the claim that the rear
piles push their face soil into the back of the forward piles to increase the displacements
further, as noted in Sec. 16-15.7. A pile with a pinned head may be able to rotate enough
away from the cap load to shift a major portion of its soil load to the forward pile.
When the piles are securely attached to the pile cap, the rear piles must trail the forward
piles with exactly the same Sh. Their forward "push" is carried by soil resistance if the s'/D
ratio is large or by a combination of soil resistance and forward pile stiffness at small s'/D.
That is, if the "effective" group ks is smaller than that of a single pile, the group displacement
is larger than the single pile. If the "effective" group ks is unchanged, the group displacement
will be smaller since the group has a larger "effective" moment of inertia. When the rear piles
push on the forward piles, the result is sometimes called soil-pile-soil interaction.
Depending on where the lateral load is applied to the group, a significant bending moment
can be produced at the pile-cap interface of P^g X Tcap, with the direction depending on the
direction of Phg. This bending moment will tend to reduce the compression in some of the
piles and increase it in others. In fact, the position of the lateral load may be a significant factor
in the group behavior—whether it is at the forward or back edge or in the center of the cap.
Another question concerning group action is how the pile cap interacts with the soil. Pile
caps are usually large concrete blocks poured directly on the soil after the piles for the group
have been driven, so that the heads are at the desired elevation (or cut as required). The pile
head elevation is designed to allow sufficient embedment into the cap that one can usually
assume the heads are "fixed." Larger pile caps may be partially to fully embedded in the
ground as well. The combined result is that a portion of the lateral load is carried by friction,
a part by passive resistance, and the remainder by the piles. It is usual, however, to assume
the piles carry all the lateral load via shear at the interface with the bottom of the pile cap. It
should be evident that for the case as described it is very difficult to compute by any means
what the actual lateral pile cap displacement will be.
We also have not answered the question of how much of the total group load Phg each
pile in a laterally loaded pile group carries. Statements have been made that some of the rear
(or interior) piles may only carry about 25 percent of the lateral load. In using a computer
program it is a trivial exercise to reduce the lateral soil stiffnesses of the interior piles and in-
crease that of the exterior piles. If the lateral soil stiffness were sufficiently reduced, it may be
possible to compute some rather small loads for the interior piles since the computer program
only manipulates the numbers that are input. The author would suggest that if the program
computes very small loads (and if you have confidence in the program), give consideration
to removing some of the piles to increase the s/D (and actual sf/D) ratio.
Lastly, there is a question of how the use of battered piles in a group will affect the load
distribution among the piles. From inspection of Fig. 16-22 we see that a battered pile is more
efficient if the batter (pile on left) resists the load. It should also be evident that if the lateral
load is reversible and battered piles are used, there will be variation in the pile constants since
one load mode gives maximum efficiency and the other mode gives minimum. The maximum
efficiency (batter resists load) may be reasonably analyzed and in the group analysis the pile
constant components are correctly summed. In contrast, in the minimum efficiency mode the


batter is with the load and with the vertical load component carried by a combination of pile
bending and shaft bearing on the soil. In this configuration obtaining a reliable set of pile
constants would be very difficult.
Until there is some supporting field testing with results reported in a useful format, you
will simply have to do the best you can with your group analysis. Use comments made here
as a guide with your computer program to make your "best" estimates of what to use for pile
constants.
If the lateral group displacement is much over two times (but depending on what that two
times is—especially if it is only about 6-10 mm) that of the single pile similarly loaded, you
probably should investigate increasing the s'/D; try to obtain some reliance on pile cap-to-
ground friction; and see if it is possible to use passive pressure. Also check your computer data
for input errors; have you inadvertently reduced the stiffness of one or more piles excessively?
In pile group design it is conventional practice, which seems to work reasonably well, to
assume that in a group of n vertical piles each pile carries PhJn and/or Pvg/n. Nearly all
groups carry vertical load, but not all groups carry a lateral load, and very few groups—
primarily waterfront structures—carry only lateral load.

18-10 MATRIX ANALYSIS FOR PILE GROUPS
When pile-group loadings consist of vertical loads concentrically placed or with an eccen-
tricity on the order of not more than 0.675* and with all vertical piles, the pile loads can be
predicted with sufficient accuracy using Eq. (18-19) or Eq. (18-20) based on experience.
When the pile group is loaded with larger eccentricities, large bending moments, and/or
horizontal forces and includes both vertical and batter piles, the analysis becomes quite
complex. Approximate solutions were proposed by Culmann (simple force polygon) and
Westergaard (using a center-of-rotation method). Neither of these solutions recognized that
vertical piles can carry lateral loads and moments. Later Hrennikoff (1950) proposed a three-
dimensional group solution, which he simplified to place major emphasis on two-dimensional
pile groups. This method remained dormant until the early 1960s partly because these anal-
yses are better performed on digital computers. Aschenbrenner (1967) introduced a method
of group analysis using pinned pile caps. Saul (1968) introduced a general three-dimensional
matrix solution, and Reese et al. (1970) published a similar matrix solution. Bowles (1974a)
published a matrix solution similar to the one presented in this section; however, the orien-
tation of the pile forces in the solution presented here makes computation of the direction
cosines quite straightforward compared with Bowles' earlier solution.
The matrix solution consists in the use of the same matrix equations presented in Chap. 9:
P = AF e - A1X F - Se = SA7X P = ASA1X
The essential difference in that solution and the pile-group solution is as follows:

1. The equation P = AF is for a single (/th) pile; thus,
P = that part of the total pile-cap force carried by the /th pile
A = a complete matrix relating the /th pile forces to the part of the
total pile-cap force carried by the /th pile (see Table 18-2)
2. The S matrix introduces the concept of pile constants instead of the familiar AEl/L, 2El/L,
and soil "spring" terms K used in Chap. 9. Here it is necessary to solve a laterally loaded
pile to obtain eight of the 10 S-matrix entries and compute the S(I, 1) entry as XAE/Lp\


TABLE 18-2
The A matrix

the S(4,4) entry as flG'J/Lp to produce a complete 56,6 stiffness (or spring) matrix for
each pile in the group. In these expressions the following terms appear:
E = modulus of elasticity of pile material
G' = shear modulus = E/[2{\ + /z,)] of pile material
A = axial adjustment factor (see values in later discussion)
fi = torsion adjustment factor (see values in later discussion)
A = cross-sectional area of pile as used, but do not include any
plug for open-end pipe or HP sections
/ = torsion inertia, computed as
Round shapes / = -~z(dl - df) (hollow pipe)
dwtl + lbftl
HP piles J= J f
3. The ASAT is computed for each pile in the pile group and summed into a group (or global)
ASAT matrix. For a four-pile group, each ASAT entry is the sum of four individual pile
ASAT values.
4. The pile-group ASAT matrix (size 6 X 6) is inverted and the foundation displacements, or
X's, are obtained.
5. With the X values the pile-head displacements (e's) are computed using
e = ATX
This calculation is necessary because the A matrix (and the AT) contains entries relating
to the pile position with respect to the origin of coordinates, which disallows use of the
equation F = SATX.
6. With the pile displacements e, the pile forces can be computed as


The matrix solution is completely general, in that six degrees of freedom are used—three
translations, of x, y, and z, and three rotations, of ax, ay, az. The principal assumption is that
the pile cap is perfectly rigid such that only rigid body displacements of body translation and
rotation with respect to a set of body axes occur. It is assumed that no bending rotations or
cap elongations between pile heads take place; e.g., for a given x translation, each pile head
has an x component displacement of the same value, etc.
The A matrix (refer to Fig. 18-11 and Table 18-2) is built as follows:

1. Note Fv is always parallel to the xz plane.
2. j8 = angle of pile projection with x axis.
3. 6 = slope of batter pile with horizontal.
4. Pile heads do not have to be at the same elevation.
5. Note that the pile forces act on the cap in the direction opposite to the positive directions
shown for the pile.

The P\ and M- values are related to the pile-cap forces as follows:

Pile force Component part of Pile force Component part of
Fx P(I) M'x P(4)
Py P(2) M'y P(5)
P'z P(3) M[ P(6)
Z " ^ ; = PO) Z " P ; = P(2) etc.

The /3 angle is zero for vertical piles and varies from 0 to 360° (or 0 to ±180°) rotated
clockwise about the vertical y axis of Fig. 18-12. The angle 6 defines any pile batter as shown:
For a vertical pile 6 = 0°.
The pile S matrix is as shown in Table 18-3 from the relationship of F = Se. Table 18-4
gives the correspondence of the S matrix and the corresponding pile constants input as C(I, J)
and their method of computation. Also shown are the computations to produce the pile con-
stants of Examples 18-7 and 18-8. Note that eight of the pile constants are obtained from a
lateral pile analysis with four each from considering the pile x axis (strong) and four from
the pile y axis (weak) resisting bending and displacement. When the pile is square or round,
the eight constants reduce to four different values, as
C(I, 2) = C(1,4)
C(I, 3) = C(lt5)
C(I, 7) = C(I, 9)
C(I, 8) - C(I, 10)
The axial pile constant C(I, 1) can be computed from the displacement obtained from Sec.
16-13 if the computed pile axial force is close to the value that is obtained from the group
output. We would obtain the displacement 8P = ep and axial force Pp from the computations
of Sec. 16-13. Here

ular to pile axis, and is also perpendicular to Fu. Also Fw is perpendicular to Fv.

so that

C(I, 1) = S(I, D = ^

More generally, we would estimate C(1,1) using A = cross-sectional area of pile (no
soil plug), which also may be composite using concrete with steel casing; E = modulus of
elasticity; and Lp = pile length (total including any part not embedded). For friction piles
we might take A = 2.0 for the embedded part, but you will somehow have to include an ad-
justment if the pile is point-bearing and/or friction and/or partially embedded, for example,
off-shore structures. For point-bearing piles use A ~ 1.2 to 1.1, since any point-bearing pile

will carry some load in side friction. Battered piles will undergo more vertical displacement
than vertical piles for the same vertical load component [see Kim and Brungraber (1976)].
Batter piles will also displace laterally under vertical load. Clearly, these latter two statements
translate into some additional adjustment in the A term to make the axial spring softer and
a modification in the Cm term to make the lateral soil resistance more or less, as outlined in
Sec. 16-15.6.
For the ft G'J/Lp = C(I, 6) = S(4,4) term, we must compute G' = shear modulus of the
pile using the equation given earlier where Poisson's ratio is usually taken as 0.15 for concrete
and 0.33 for steel. For steel compute

The torsion constant J is computed using the equation given earlier and, inserting values
for the HP360 X 174, we obtain
dwtj + 2bffj
J ~ 3
j = i [(0.361 - 2 X 0.0204)0.02043 + 2 X 0.378 X 0.02043]
= 3.0455 X 1(T6 m4
The value of ft ranges from 2 to 4; unpublished research by the author using 8-ft model
piles fitted with strain gauges indicates 2.5 is reasonable. Constant C(I, 6) is not very critical

since principal group torsion resistance is obtained from pile head shear. For several piles
spaced around the load point, substantial torsion resistance can be obtained with little direct
contribution for the individual pile torsion responses.

GENERAL COMMENTS ON PROCEDURE

1. Pile head constants reduce to C(I, 1), C(I, 2), and C(1,4) for piles pinned to the cap—not a
very realistic pile cap system. Pinned piles will produce cap moments depending on pile
coordinates. Also round-off errors may indicate computed pile forces when they should
be zero.
2. The y axis coordinate allows you to model a thick cap since the origin of coordinates is
usually the top plane of the cap. A thick cap will produce a moment Ph X Y that tends to
rotate the pile cap and increase some axial forces and decrease others. This moment cannot
be avoided but is accounted for in the program by using a y coordinate for the pile head
that is the cap thickness. The cap must be thick or else it is not rigid (but the computer
program does not know this). Do not forget to include cap weight into the vertical cap
load.
3. No methods currently exist that are practical to model batter piles for pile constants except
to adjust ks as outlined in Sec. 16-15.6. The method given by Bowles (1974a) allowed a
batter pile analysis but did not provide any procedures to adjust ks (assuming an adjust-
ment is necessary) for the pile being battered. Depending on the lay of the batter, a lateral
force will either cause it to rise and translate or lay and translate. With translation, how-
ever, there is axial movement which produces skin resistance that in turn requires load
transfer curves.
4. For a linear analysis (small lateral displacements) it is only necessary to make a lateral
pile analysis using a single load or moment about each axis (unless round) and make plots
as shown in Fig. E16-13c for the eight pile constants. You can make a nonlinear analysis
by adjusting for X > XMAX, but few designers want pile caps to translate more than 6
to 10 mm, where a linear analysis is likely to be nearly correct.
5. The pile cap displacements can be used to estimate cap movements if you have confidence
in the pile constants. The pile forces output is used directly for a structural design of the
cap. You can design the piles by reusing the pile data used to develop the curves such
as Fig. E16-13c, taking the pile as having a free head, and applying the head moment
and shear for each direction to see if a larger moment is obtained farther down the shaft.
Usually, however, the fixed-head moment in this analysis is the largest and is suitable for
design.
6. You can orient the principal axis of the pile parallel to the appropriate cap (or global)
axis. You may orient different piles at different axis orientations when they are vertical;
however, the pile axis rotates with angle /3, so when you make a group layout be sure to
take this into account.
7. Pile constants for partially embedded piles in a group are computed similar to fully
embedded piles. It is necessary (assuming you use program FADBEMLP) to specify
the node where the soil line starts JTSOIL but specify head fixities at node 1. These
are: translation = 0.0 for one execution; rotation = 0.0 for one execution. The output is


plotted, and computations for the constants are made similar to that given by Example
16-13 where the pile was fully embedded.

The method will be illustrated by two problems with computer output listed. The first
problem is a symmetrical pile group with an axial load and moment about the z axis. The
second example is general in that the piles are given batters and the group is not symmetrical.

Example 18-7. Analyze the nine-pile group of Fig. E18-7« using a cap that is 0.6 m thick; this is
not a "rigid" cap with the plan dimensions shown, but for purposes of illustration we will assume it
is—the computer program does not know. Obtain the pile constants from Fig. E16-13c (as computed
for Table 18-4) and for the loads shown on the output sheet of Fig. El 8-7/?. Carefully note that we
are using a single set of pile constants for all nine piles; with an s/D ratio of about 2.25 it should be
evident that there should be four sets of pile constants (piles 4, 5, 7, and 8); the others are similar

You may orient the x axis either horizontally as shown or down the page, but the z axis also rotates.
If you rotate the axis be sure that the pile constants (or springs) are oriented correctly. Orientation
is of no consequence for round piles but makes a substantial difference for HP piles.
This problem requires using computer program FAD3DPG (B-IO) to obtain a solution; this data
set is on your diskette as EXAM 187.DTA.

Discussion of output.

1. The computer program outputs all critical input [x, y, z coordinates, angle /3, pile batter ratios,
and pile constants C(I, J) for each pile]. Note the program requires all 10 pile constants.
2. The global ASAT matrix is not always symmetrical, and with all vertical piles (as here) it con-
tains a large number of zeros. It is not symmetrical because it contains both elastic entries and
position vector entries from the lower left corner of the A matrix.
3. The cap displacements are listed, and we see that the principal displacement for this group
configuration and loading of 7200 kN is vertical at 0.006 849 m (6.85 mm), which is not un-
expected. The cap has a small az rotation of 0.000336 rad from the Mz moment, which was
input as (-) using the right-hand rule for the z axis. The sign is therefore correct for the mo-
ment direction. If the XAE/L is accepted as correct then the vertical group settlement under
load is 6.85 mm, and no further settlement computations are required unless there is a consoli-
dating layer of clay below the pile points. Horizontal displacements are 0.0 since there was no
Px or Pz.
4. There are only pile moments MV (= Mv) of 4.261 kN • m with a (+) sign, consistent with the
applied moment M1 = -500 kN • m. The conventional P/A ± Mc/I analysis would not obtain
these pile-head moments, which are caused by head fixity to the cap.
5. The moments MX are from position of the piles with respect to the x axis. The three piles
on the axis (2, 5, 8) have MX = 0. Pile 1 has MX = FU X Z = 745.047 X 1.2 = 894.0504
as shown. The other MX values are computed similarly in making the X MX = 0 statics
check.
6. Moments MZ are computed, e.g., for pile 1 as FU X X + MV = 745.042 X 1.4 - 4.261 =
1038.797 [-MV since a (+) pile moment acts in opposite direction on the cap]. Note the
three piles on the z axis have no x moment arm so the MZ moment is -4.261. The X MZ =
-500.0007 versus -500.0 input.
7. In the general case where the A matrix has a number of sine and cosine entries, it is most useful
to have the program make the statics check as shown here.

Example 18-8. Analyze the nine-pile group of Fig. ElS-Sa, which is a general case of Example
18-7 using the same pile constants but also with batters and /3 angles on selected piles. To simplify
input/output we will again use the same set of pile constants as in Example 18-7 even though this
is not strictly correct.


Figure E18-8a
Solution. Using computer program B-IO, one can obtain the output shown in Fig. ElS-Sb.

Discussion of results. Because of the pile batters we will only look at pile 2, which is vertical. The
computer program has facility to allow output of the pile A and SAT matrices, but this is left for the
reader.

1. Pile 2 has a vertical axial force of 991.475 kN; a force FV parallel to the z axis of -38.998
kN; a force FW parallel to the x axis of -6.786 kN; and moments MU = 0.206 kN • m, MV =
25.11 kN • m, and MW = -137.814 kN • m. These values can be directly used for designing the
pile. The signs for FU, FV, etc., are (-) when opposite to the (+) directions of the pile as shown
in Fig. 18-12ft.
2. The force component contribution (pile-head forces to cap results in a sign change):
FX = -6.786 kN (shear parallel to x axis «-)
FY = -991.475 kN (axial loadt on cap)
FZ = 38.9977 kN (shear parallel to z axis; note pile 4 carries most of 600 kN)
MX = 161.2125 = 137.814 + 0.6 X 38.9977 (pile head is 0.6 m below xz plane)
MY = 54.8030 = 38.9977 X 1.4 + 0.206
MZ = -1358.8810 = 991.4748 X 1.4 - 25.112 - 6.786 X 0.6
3. Pile 5 has DU = 0.0082 m = y = -0.008187 m| cap settlement at load point. Other values
include effect of pile head at 0.6 m below origin of coordinates and any rotations about the x and
z axes.

18-11 PILE CAP DESIGN BY COMPUTER
The preceding section outlined pile group design for a rigid pile cap. The computer program
outputs pile-head forces, which can be used in the structural design of the piles or, possibly,
to relocate select piles for a better balance of pile forces and to limit cap rotation. The basic
limitation was that the cap be absolutely rigid, but criteria defining a rigid cap were not
given.
This section addresses the complete group cap and pile design as a cap-pile interaction
process. This can be done [see Bowles (1983)] as follows:

1. Revise the mat program to use 6 degrees-of-freedom nodes so there is a direct relationship
between the 6-d.o.f. pile head and the cap (or mat) node.
2. Slightly reorder the pile-group computer program to be a subroutine of the revised mat
program.
3. Grid the pile cap so nodes occur at all pile-head locations.
4. Build the stiffness matrix (ASAT) for the cap as a plate or mat.
5. Build the stiffness matrix (ASAT) for each pile in turn and add the entries into the cap
(or global) ASAT using superposition of effects. This step is similar to that for adding
node soil springs. Here the pile stiffness matrix is effectively an array of "springs" that
are added to the appropriate cap stiffness entries from use of Tables 18-2 and 3.
6. Invert the stiffness matrix (or reduce the band array), and obtain the cap moments and
shears at nodes.
7. Using the pile "group" subroutine, compute the pile-head forces. The following precau-
tions are required:
a. The X, Y, and Z terms in the lower left corner of the pile A matrix of Table 18-2 are
not used in building the pile ASAT to add to the cap ASAT since the pile-node location
automatically includes the effects of the x and z coordinates. This will then give a
symmetrical pile ASAT so the global cap matrix will remain symmetrical and can be
banded.
b. When computing the statics check for the piles, go back and use the full A matrix of
Table 18-2.

Figure 18-13 illustrates the general case of 6-d.o.f. nodes and the corresponding forces
on the beam-column element. Note that the AE/L term for element axial compression and
bending about the y axis is not used in design of the cap but is necessary to allow the six
general loadings at loaded nodes.
As previously stated, for only vertical piles and vertical cap loads, any 3-d.o.f. FEM (or
the mat) program can be used. Where pile caps are loaded by vertical and horizontal loads
and moments about one or more axes and with horizontal loads and/or moments the general
6-d.o.f. solution is necessary.
Figure 18-14 is an edited part of the 6-d.o.f. A matrix. The remainder can be developed
using the element forces applied to the node in a manner similar to the 3-d.o.f case. The full
6-d.o.f. S matrix for any cap element is given in Fig. 18-15.
Solution by the author of a number of pile cap cases indicates that (depending on pile
spacing s) a very thick cap is often required to produce a "rigid" cap.

right-hand rule for moment sign convention. Other coding can be used but that shown here corresponds to author's
computer program. [Bowles (1983).]

The author's computer program for this analysis is FADPILCP (B-28) and makes use of a
data generator program (B-28A) since there is a very large amount of element data to input—
even for small pile caps.
To the author's knowledge there is currently no other general rational procedure available
for use in the structural analysis/design of a pile cap taking flexibility of cap (and piles) into
account. Apparently the CDF (1984, page 33 of report) in their extensive literature search
also did not find any alternatives.

PROBLEMS
18-1. Compute the allowable group capacity Qa using an SF = 3 for the six-pile group of Fig. 18-1«
using the Converse-Labarre equation and compare with the CDF recommendation. Pile and
group data include . S = I m , pile length L — 25 m, and D = 400 mm. The piles are in a
medium coarse sand with a computed single-pile capacity of 1200 kN.
18-2. Using the pile and group data of Prob. 18-1, assume the piles are in a cohesive soil of su = 75
kPa. Use the a method of Chap. 16 with the API value from Fig. 16-14 to compute ultimate
pile capacity. With these data estimate the group capacity. What does the Converse-Labarre
equation give for group capacity? As in Prob. 18-1 use an SF = 3 to obtain the design group
capacity Qa.
18-3. A pile group consists of three piles as in Fig. 18-l<z. The piles are HP360 X 152, used as friction
piles. The group is subjected to an axial load of 1700 kN. The pile spacing is 0.831 m. Take
/A = 0,40 and case 2 (Table 18-1Z?) conditions,
a Compute the stress, using Table 18-Ib, in the soil at the center of the group 1.8 m below the
bottom of the piles, which are 18 m long,
b Compute the stress 1.8 m beneath one of the piles.
Answer: = 29.8 kPa
c Compare the stress in (a) and (b) with that obtained using the Boussinesq theory of
Chap. 5.
d Compare the stresses of (a) and (b) with that obtained from the method shown in Fig. 18-4«
and Z?.
18-4. A clay stratum 4.6 m thick is located 2.5 m beneath the points of the pile group of Prob. 18-3.
The soil overlying the clay consists of a sandy material with a unit weight of 18.1 kN/m3 for
the top immediate 3.6 m and y' = 8.6 kN/m3 (average) to the clay stratum. The clay has y =
19.81 kN/m3 with wN = 28.5, WL = 36.2, and Wp = 17.4 percent. Compute the estimated
consolidation settlement of this pile group. Hint: Assume Gs = 2.70 for clay and use one of
the correlation equations of Chap. 2 for Cc.


18-5. A pile group consists of nine square concrete piles as in Fig. 18-1 a. The piles are 300 X 300
mm with Ec = 26 500 MPa. The pile lengths are 20 m. The ultimate group load guit = 10 800
kN. The soil has an undrained shear strength c = 60 kPa at - 3 m to 90 kPa at - 4 0 m. The
water table is at elevation - 5 m. The cap is poured on the ground. Cc at elevation - 1 5 m is
0.45. The saturated unit weight is 17.53 kN/m3. Estimate the total group settlement and ac in
Eq. (16-12) used to obtain L.
18-6. Redo Example 18-3 for a linear (case 3) increase in skin friction.
Answer: = 19.2 kPa
18-7. Estimate the settlement in Example 18-4 due to negative skin friction.
18-8. What width of fill would compute the measured settlement of Example 18-4?
18-9. The pile of Prob. 18-5 is assumed to be in parallel with the soil. The contributory cap area is
2 X 2 m. The existing modulus of subgrade reaction ks is taken as 9500 kN/m3. Estimate the
equivalent soil modulus k's for the pile node so the node spring is K = a X b X k's.
Answer: Approx. 303 900 kN/m3 using A = 2.0 in the term XAE/L
18-10. Assume in Example 18-6 the pile length is 36 m and other conditions are the same. What is the
negative skin friction? Assume the pipe piles are filled with concrete of /c' = 35 MPa. Can the
piles carry this negative skin friction?
18-11. Do Example 18-8 if all but piles 7 and 9 are vertical.
18-12. Do Example 18-8 if piles 7, 8, and 9 are battered at 4:1 and piles 7 and 9 are skewed as in the
example. All batter directions are to be taken as in example.
18-13. Verify the eight pile constants from Fig. E16-13Z? and c.
18-14. Do Example 18-7 using your estimation of A and ip in pile constants C(I, 1) and C(I, 4).
18-15. Form the remainder of the A matrix of Fig. 18-4. How many stiffness entries will the product
of £ASAT have for any element?
18-16. Compute the approximate pile loads of Example 18-7 using Eq. (18-9) adjusted for moment
about only the z axis. Compare these computed pile loads to the computer output and make any
appropriate comments.
Answer: Pmax = 860 (vs. 853.1) using Iz = 11.76
18-17. Make two copies of data set EXAMl 87.DTA and set Mz = 0 so you only have a vertical load.
Now execute one set and obtain a set of output axial pile forces.
Using the other data set copy, increase the AE/L springs for piles 2,4,6, and 8 by 20 percent
(value X 1.2). Increase the AE/L springs for piles 1, 3,7, and 9 by 30 percent (value X 1.3). Now
make a second analysis and compare pile loads. Does the comparison have any resemblance to
the Vesic comments that side and corner piles carry more load than the interior piles?
18-18. Make two copies of data set EXAM87.DTA and in both set the vertical force Py = 0 (It is now
- 720OkN) and Mz = 0 and input a Px = Px = +90OkN (a single lateral force parallel to the
x axis).
Make an execution and check the output to ensure you have done everything correctly for
that data set.
Next take the second data set and reduce the horizontal pile springs for piles 4, 5, and 6 by
20 percent each and the back springs for piles 1, 2, and 3 by 15 percent (value X 0.85). The
horizontal springs are the PX/8X values of Table 18-4. If the results are not very good, consider
reducing the off-diagonal terms of M1Jbx as well. Can you draw any conclusions from these
two executions about "soil-pile-soil" interaction?


19-1 INTRODUCTION
The drilled pier is constructed by drilling a cylindrical hole of the required depth and sub-
sequently filling it with concrete. The shaft may be straight or the base may be enlarged by
underreaming. This structural member is also termed as follows:
a. Drilled shaft
b. Drilled caisson (or sometimes, simply, a caisson)
c. Bored pile (but usually restricted to D < 760 mm)
If the base is enlarged the member takes one of these names:
d. Belled pier (or belled caisson)
e. Underreamed foundation
These several configurations are shown in Fig. 19-1.
The term caisson is also used to describe large prefabricated box-type structures that can
be sunk through soft ground or water at a site to provide a dry work space.
This chapter will focus primarily on the analysis and design of drilled piers.

19-2 CURRENT CONSTRUCTION METHODS
Early drilled piers were constructed by digging the shaft and/or bell by hand although drilling
methods using horse power were in use in the early 1900s. Early methods include the Chicago
and Gow methods shown in Fig. 19-2. In the Chicago method, workers excavated a circular
pit to a convenient depth and placed a cylindrical shell of vertical boards or staves held in
place by an inside compression ring. Excavation depth then continued to the next board length
and a second tier of staves was set, etc., to the required shaft depth. The tiers could be set at
a constant diameter or stepped in about 50 mm.

The Gow method, which used a series of telescoping metal shells, is about the same as the
current method of using casing except for the telescoping sections reducing the diameter on
successive tiers.
The shaft base can be enlarged for additional bearing if the base soil does not cave (i.e., if
founded in a fairly stiff nonfissured clay). Many of the early piers were founded on rock.
Drilled piers—particularly large-diameter ones—are not often used in groups. Most often
a drilled pier interfaces with a single column carrying a very large superstructure load. Re-
inforcing bars may be required either for the full pier depth Lp or only in the upper moment-
active zone (about Lp/2). The rebars—if used—are to carry any tensile Mc/I stress from shaft
moment. Reinforcing bars may not be required in those cases where the pier requires steel
casing that is filled with concrete to form a metal-encased shaft.
The shaft moment may result from using a fixed-base column, from accidental misalign-
ment of the load-carrying column with the pier shaft (a P-A type effect not known at the
time the pier is designed), or from lateral loads from the superstructure (which are usually
known). Since the pier shaft is embedded in the soil, where its temperature is a relatively con-
stant value, T&S steel is used only as a designer prerogative or if the local building official
requires its use.
The reinforcing bars are usually prewired—including vertically spaced tie bars—into a
designed pattern called a rebar cage, which can be set as a unit into the pier shaft cavity
into about 1 m of previously poured concrete (so that the bars are not in contact with earth) and

the remaining space filled with concrete to form a vertically reinforced structural member.
Where the rebars are not required for the full depth, some concrete is placed, the rebar cage
is set, and then the shaft pour is continued.
The shaft supports for the Chicago and Gow methods were usually left in place since the
pier did not rely on shaft friction. Furthermore, they were not very easy to remove after the
concrete had been poured.
Currently, labor and insurance costs for hazardous conditions preclude hand digging shafts,
so machine digging is universally used. There are three basic methods (site variables may
require a mix of methods, however).

1. DRY METHOD. Here the production sequence is as in Fig. 19-3. First the shaft is drilled
(and belled if required). Next the shaft is partly filled with concrete as in Fig. 19-3Z? with
the rebar cage then set and the shaft completed. Note that the rebar cage should never go
all the way to the bottom, for a minimum concrete cover is required, but it may extend nearly
the full shaft depth rather than approximately one-half as shown here.
This method requires site soils be noncaving (cohesive) and the water table be below the
base or the permeability so low the shaft can be drilled (pumped possibly) and concreted
before it fills with sufficient water to affect the concrete strength.

2. CASING METHOD. This method is outlined in Fig. 19-4. Casing is used at sites where
caving or excessive lateral deformation toward the shaft cavity can occur. It is also used where
it is desired to seal the hole against groundwater entry but to do this requires an impermeable
stratum below the caving zone into which the casing can be socketed. Note that until the
casing is inserted, a slurry is used to maintain the hole. After the casing is seated the slurry
is bailed out and the shaft extended to the required depth in the dry stratum. Depending on
the site and project requirements the shaft below the casing will be decreased to at least the
ID of the casing—sometimes 25 to 50 mm less for better auger clearance.
The casing may be left in place or pulled. If it is left in place the annular space between
casing OD and soil (currently filled with slurry or drilling fluid) is displaced with pressure-
injected grout (a cement + water + additives) mixture. By inserting a tube to the base of the
slurry and pumping grout the slurry is displaced over the top so the void is filled with grout.
Alternatively, the casing can be pulled but with great care to ensure the following:

a. Concrete inside casing is still in a fluid state.
b. Concrete "head" is always sufficiently greater than the slurry head that concrete displaces
slurry and not vice versa.

Pulling the casing may result in a substantially oversize top shaft zone—depending on how
close the casing OD and initial shaft ID match. The oversize is seldom of consequence but
may need to be known so that the total shaft volume can be compared to concrete volume
used to ensure the shaft does not contain any accidental voids. The change in shaft diameters
will produce an increase in capacity from the ledge-bearing Qi.

3. SLURRY METHOD. This method is applicable for any situation requiring casing. It is
required if it is not possible to get an adequate water seal with the casing to keep groundwater
out of the shaft cavity. The several steps are outlined in Fig. 19-5. Note that it is essential in
this method that a sufficient slurry head is available (or that the slurry density can be increased

as needed) so the inside pressure is greater than that from the GWT or from the tendency of
the soil to cave. Many of the considerations of slurry trench construction discussed in Sec.
14-9 are equally applicable here.
Bentonite is most commonly used with water to produce the slurry ("bentonite slurry")
but other materials (admixtures) may be added. Some experimentation may be required to
obtain optimum percentage for a site, but amounts in the range of 4 to 6 percent by weight of
admixture are usually adequate.

The bentonite should be well mixed with water so that the mixture is not lumpy. The slurry
should be capable of forming a filter cake on the shaft wall and of carrying the smaller (say,
under 6 mm) excavated particles in suspension. Sometimes if the local soil is very clayey it
may be used to obtain an adequate slurry. The shaft is generally not underreamed for a bell
since this procedure leaves unconsolidated cuttings on the base and creates a possibility of
trapping slurry between the concrete base and bell roof.

Sump


With the slurry method the following are generally desirable:

a. Not have slurry in the shaft for such a long time that an excessively thick filter cake forms
on the shaft wall; a thick cake is difficult to displace with concrete during shaft filling.
b. Have the slurry pumped and the larger particles in suspension screened out with the "con-
ditioned" slurry returned to the shaft just prior to concreting.
c. Exercise care in excavating clay through the slurry so that pulling a large fragment does
not cause sufficient negative pore pressure or suction to develop and collapse a part of the
shaft.

When the shaft is complete the rebar cage is set in place and a tremie installed (this se-
quence is usually necessary so that the tremie does not have to be pulled to set the cage and
then reinserted—almost certain to produce a slurry-film discontinuity in the shaft). Concrete
made using small aggregate is pumped and great care is taken that the tremie is always well
submerged in the concrete so a minimum surface area is exposed and contaminated with
slurry. It appears that the concrete will adequately displace slurry particles from the rebar
cage so a good bond can be obtained, and as previously noted, if the shaft is not open too long
the filter cake is reasonably displaced as well.

19-3 WHEN TO USE DRILLED PIERS
Drilled piers can be used in most cases requiring pile foundations. Where the site soil requires
use of deep foundations one should make a comparative analysis to determine whether piles
or drilled piers are more economical.
Drilled piers have the following direct advantages:

a. They eliminate the need for pile caps, for dowels can be placed in the wet concrete at
the required plan location (even if pier center is slightly misaligned) for direct column
attachment.
b. They use fewer but with larger diameter shafts.
c. Their use eliminates much of the vibration and noise associated with pile driving.
d. They can go through a boulder soil where driven piles might be deflected. Boulders of
size less than about one-third the shaft diameter can be directly removed. Others may be
broken with special tools, or a temporary casing can be installed to give access for hand
drilling and blasting larger rocks.
e. It is easy to enlarge the top portion of the pier shaft to allow for larger bending moments.
/. Almost any diameter shaft in the range of 0.460 to 3.5 m can be produced.
g. Larger-diameter shafts (if cased) allow direct inspection of bearing capacity and soil at
shaft base.

There are a few disadvantages:

a. They cannot be used if a suitable bearing stratum is not close enough to the ground surface
(and assuming that the soil to the competent stratum is unreliable for skin resistance).
b. Bad weather conditions may make drilling and/or concreting difficult.


c. There may be ground loss if adequate precautions are not taken.
d. One must dispose of soil from drilling ("spoil") and any slurry that is used.

19-4 OTHER PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR
DRILLED PIERS
Several practical considerations of importance in drilled pier construction include shaft align-
ment, disposal of slurry, concrete quality control, underreaming, and ground loss.

Shaft Alignment
It is often difficult to get a drilled pier perfectly aligned either in plan or elevation. If the plan
location is within about 150 mm this is usually satisfactory. Much larger misalignment may
require an adjustment in design for the additional moment resulting from eccentricity of the
design load.
Maximum vertical misalignment as suggested by ACI Committee 336 (1988) is as follows:

Category A. Unreinforced shafts extending through materials offering minimal lateral
restraint—not more than 0.125 X diameter
Category B. Same, but soil is competent for lateral restraint—not more than 0.015 x shaft
length
Category C Reinforced concrete shaft—to be determined on a site basis by the project
engineer

Slurry Disposal
Slurry disposal is always a problem. One might use a (or several) large storage tank(s) on-site
as temporary storage so the slurry can be reconditioned and reused to keep the total required
volume to a minimum. One may construct a storage pit for the same purpose. Ultimately,
however, the remaining residue must be hauled to a suitable disposal site.

Concrete Quality Control
Concrete is often specified in the 28 to 35 MPa range to reduce the shaft diameter. The slump
should be in the range of 125 to 150 mm. Some persons suggest slumps in the range of 125
to 250 mm but one should check whether adequate (and reliable) strength can be obtained
at slumps over 150 mm. Higher slumps are more necessary in slurry construction than for
cased or uncased piers. Proprietary plasticizers are available to improve flowability (reason
for large slumps) and eliminate arching. These might be appropriate for the dry method or
with casing. Use of a plasticizer in the slurry method might be a viable solution, but there
should be reasonable certainty that there will be no adverse chemical reactions with the slurry
constituents.
To ensure reasonable shaft continuity, one should compare the shaft and concrete volumes
for each pier. Several highly specialized nondestructive test procedures are available to mea-
sure shaft continuity (and quality, e.g., for voids) where a defective shaft is suspected [see
Olson and Thompson (1985)] and the concrete has hardened. Sometimes a small-diameter
core is taken from a suspect shaft.


Test cylinders are routinely taken to have a record of the concrete strength used. This
aspect is usually set up by the project engineer using ACI guidelines. The top 1.5 m of the
shaft should be vibrated to ensure adequate density.
Underreaming
Underreaming or belling can be done in noncaving soils to enlarge the base to increase the
bearing capacity where the base is founded on soil. For bases on rock the bearing capacity of
the rock is often at least as large as that of the shaft based on /c' of the concrete.
Belling produces unconsolidated cuttings on the base soil. Some of these may be isolated
into the reamer seat (pilot depression of Fig. 19-Id). Alternatively, a temporary casing can
be installed and an inspector lowered to the base to remove the cuttings by hand and to check
the soil strength with a pocket penetrometer.
Bells may enlarge the base up to about four times the shaft diameter. As there would be
great difficulty in placing rebars, the enlarged base is seldom reinforced. By using a maximum
slope on the underream of 45°, two-way action shear is usually adequate so that the shaft does
not "punch" through the bell. Bending should not be of concern for the short moment arm
of about 1.5D maximum. Also note the concrete is placed in a fluid state so that it flows to
a substantial contact pressure against the soil from the hydrostatic head. After hardening the
soil provides substantial "confinement" to the bell to aid in resisting bending and punching
failure.

Ground Loss
When the shaft is drilled the loss of lateral support will allow the surrounding soil to squeeze
into the hole, decreasing its diameter. The squeeze can result in surface subsidence in the
vicinity of the hole. The amount, of course, is directly related to the reduction in hole vol-
ume. Lukas and Baker (1978) suggest that a convenient method of determining whether hole
squeezing will be a problem depends on the squeeze ratio Rs, which is the inverse of the sjp'o
ratio of Sec. 2-11.9
Rs = Po/*** (19-1)

where p'o = effective overburden pressure
su = undrained shear strength

If Rs < 6 squeezing may take place but usually it is slow enough that it is of no
consequence.
If Rs > 6 squeezing is almost certain to take place, and if Rs is on the order of 8 to
9 it will occur so rapidly it will be taking place as the hole is being
excavated.
The foregoing is based on experiences in Chicago clay, and the ratio may be somewhat dif-
ferent at other locations.
The ground loss can be controlled in the following ways:

1. Rapid shaft excavation and replacement with concrete
2. Use of a shaft liner
3. Use of the slurry method


Either of the two latter options increases project costs, and many contractors do not like to
use the slurry method because of the resulting mess and cleanup.

19-5 CAPACITY ANALYSIS OF DRILLED PIERS
Drilled piers are widely used to carry compressive loads. They are also used to carry tension
loads—particularly under power line and antenna tower legs. They may carry lateral loads
or a combination of vertical and lateral loads. The tension load case as given for piles in Sec.
16-14 can be written (here using Q instead of P) as
QuLUt=^Qn + Qb + W (19-2)

where X Qsi — sum of perimeter X fs X AL of the several (or single) shaft elements making
up total length L—ultimate value
Qb = bell pullout resistance and/or any point suction. Similarly as for piles the
point suction contribution is transient so is seldom used.
W = total pier weight including shaft and bell
Safety factors in the range of 2 to 4 are common, giving an allowable tension load of either

Qa,t ~ "gp-

or, preferably, but not much used,
n £&.• , Qb , w
Q"' = - S F T + sF
b

+ s i r (19"2«)
The use of partial safety factors as in Eq. (19-2«) is preferable since we might use SF5 = 3
or 4 for the skin resistance component because of uncertainties, an SF^7 = 2 to 5 on the bell
if Qb is included, and an SF^ of about 1.4 since the volume of concrete and resulting weight
of the pier are reasonably well known. The structural design would require that the allowable
concrete stress in tension plus rebar allowable tension stress be sufficient to carry the tension
design load Qd,t ^ Qa,t-

19-5.1 Pier Capacity in Compression
The ultimate capacity of a drilled pier (see Fig. 19-6) in compression is the smaller of
Guit = X Q'si + X QL + QP (19"3«)
or
Guit = X Q« +JlQL + Q'p (19-36)
where X Qsi = ultimate skin resistance as defined in Eq. (19-2)
X Q'Si = limiting skin resistance, generally < QS[
Qp = ultimate point bearing
Q'p = point bearing just at transition from ultimate to limiting skin resistance,
and is generally < Qp
ILQL = bearing resistance from any ledges produced by changes in shaft diameter
or shear rings


Figure 19-6 Capacity of straight- or stepped-shaft and belled piers. Commonly used dimensions are shown, but
other dimensions can also be used.

The rationale for Eqs. (19-3) is based on load tests for both piles and drilled piers where the
maximum skin resistance is developed at very small shaft movements on the order of about
3 to 10 mm. As a ratio the movements are on the order of 0.002D to 0.0ID. The movement
necessary to develop ultimate bearing resistance is on the order of 0.0051? to 0.055 where
B = base diameter = D for straight shafts. The base displacement to develop maximum point
resistance is much smaller for dense sand than for clay, which is often near 0.03 to 0.055.
The load test in Fig. 19-7 illustrates load resistance development as a combination of two
separate effects. The pier is 762-mm diameter X 7.01-m long and was selected because of
the particular clarity and the nearly ideal load-transfer curves that are developed. Most load
tests produce similar results but less clearly. Here we have the following:

1. At application of the first load increment of approximately 110 kN, skin resistance devel-
ops along nearly the full shaft length. The skin resistance contribution Qsi for any segment
length AL can be obtained as the difference in shaft load at the top and base of the ele-
ment. The sum of all these Qsl contributions for this load increment is simply the load Q =
HOkN.
2. With the second load increment to approximately 285 kN the load-transfer curve shifts to
the right, but we see again that the tip load of about 45 kN is negligible.
3. The third load increment (to 735 kN), however, appears to produce a "limiting" shaft skin
resistance with a small increase in point load (from 45 to about 80 kN). Also note:
a. The limiting skin resistance is analogous to the "residual" soil strength in a direct shear
test.
b. The limiting skin resistance is not constant. In the upper 1.5 m and the bottom 1.0 m
there is almost no skin resistance (in these two zones the curve is nearly vertical).
c. The point load is now the Q'p of Eq. (19-3).
4. Next, the fourth load stage of 1250 kN is applied to develop what one could define as Qu\t
for the pier. The point load has increased nearly the amount of the load increase (1250-

Figure 19-7 Load distribution for drilled pier. [From Reese and O'Neill (1969); converted to SI by author.]

735 = 515 vs. 500 - 80 = 420). An inspection of the load-transfer curve for load stage
4 shows that it is nearly identical in shape to that from the 735-kN load stage 3 load. In
comparing the last two load transfer curve shapes it is clear that the skin resistance only
increases a small amount from load stage 3 to 4, with the major part of the load increment
being carried directly by the point. The load transfer curve for load stage 4 approximates
this by its lateral displacement to the right, so the shaft curve profile is similar to curve 3,
but the bottom is shifted by very nearly the load increment.

Considering these load stages and again referring to Fig. 19-7, we see that we can define
the following:
Cult = 125OkN
Qp = 490 kN (read directly from the load-transfer curve at the tip level)
from which the skin resistance component is computed as
] T Q'si = 1250 - 490 = 760 kN
Since su in the 7.01 pier depth was about 96 kPa we can compute a full-depth a coefficient as

Depth, meters

Load, kN

Pier: D = 762 mm
L= 7.01m
su s 96 kPa(average)


however, we probably should have used a length L = 7.01 — 1.5 — 1.0 = 4.5m (and a =
0.73) since the upper 1.5 m and lower 1 m of the shaft has negligible skin resistance at
ultimate load.
If the pier load were increased to, say, 1560 kN or more, we may speculate that the load-
transfer curve would become nearly vertical to a greater depth; and the point load would
increase, with the settlement greatly increasing.
From this description of events in a load test, together with Eqs. (19-3«) and (19-3Z?), we
see that estimating the capacity of a drilled pier—particularly without the guidance of a load
test—is not a simple task in spite of the relatively simple format of the equations. Obviously,
if ultimate values of skin resistance and point bearing occurred at about the same amounts of
displacement the problem would be much simpler.
Because the shaft and point maximum load capacities are not developed simultaneously,
many practitioners use either point bearing or skin resistance rather than a combination. This
practice is common in the United States (and is not unduly conservative when the point is
founded on rock or very dense bearing soil). Others, primarily in Europe, often try to use
some kind of interaction to obtain the pier capacity as a combination of skin resistance and
point bearing. This approach is also given by Reese et al. (1976) and later by Reese (1978)
based on his extensive research. As given by Reese et al. (1976) the pier capacity in clay is
Guit = ^QSi + QP (19-4)
where X Qsi = X otsus X pf X AL
Qp = NccAp = 9su>pAp
a = reduction coefficient from Table 19-1 based on installation process
$u,s = average undrained shear strength along shaft length AL; use sUtS = cohe-
sion in range of 0 < 0 < 10°
p' = average pier perimeter in shaft length AL
AL = element length over which su>s can be taken as a constant value
su,p = average undrained shear strength from about 0.5B above base to about 3 B
below the base

Ap = area of base = 0.7854#2
B = base width

For the immediate settlement to be tolerable in clay it was recommended that the allowable
design load be
Qa = ^ > Qd (19-5)

with the SF in the range of 1.5 to 4. Alternatively, or where the base is on clay with OCR > 1,

Qa =^Qsi + ^^Qd (19-6)

The premise of Eq. (19-6) is that by reducing the base load by a factor of 3 the small slip
necessary to mobilize Qst is well within settlement tolerances. Use the smaller Qa from either
Eq. (19-5) or Eq. (19-6) above.
For piers in sand Reese et al. (1976) suggest using Eq. (19-4) with the terms separated as
X Q*i = X KPotan 8(P' x AL>
and I (19-6a)

where the new variables are as follows:
K = shaft lateral pressure factor, conservatively taken as follows:

Depth to base, m K

< 7.5 0.7
7.5 < L < 12 m 0.6
> 12 0.5

Po = average effective overburden pressure to midheight of AL
8 = <f> for pier shaft in sand because of the rough concrete interface
qp = maximum point pressure for an assumed 5 percent point displacement which,
based on load tests, is suggested as follows:

TP
Sand state kPa ksf

Loose (not likely used) 0 0
Medium (possibly used) 1600 32
Dense (very likely used) 4000 80

ap = base reduction factor to limit base settlement to 25 mm (1 in.) and given as
SI: 2.0B (base width B in meters)
Fps: 0.6B (B in feet)


SPT or CPT correlations may be used to estimate the angle of internal friction <f> in Eq.
(19-6a) unless better data is available, since the lateral pressure coefficient K as given above
is considered to be conservative. One would never found a drilled pier base on loose sand
and probably would not place the point on a medium dense sand unless a more competent
stratum is at a substantially greater depth.
IfEq. (19-6a) is used, the immediate settlement should not be a problem, since it is based
on a 25-mm maximum settlement through use of the ap factor. The allowable pier design
load Qa is

Qa ~ s p
It is recommended to use SF = 1.0 when Qu\t = point value from Eq. (\6-6a) with AH p ~ 25
mm; use SF = 1.5 to 4 when skin resistance is included in Quit and with point settlement
AHp now somewhat less than 25 mm.
We should note that Eqs. (19-3) and (19-4) are theoretically correct and that Eqs. (19-6) are
empirical. Any difference between the theoretical equations and load-test values are from us-
ing incorrect design parameters to estimate the skin resistance and point capacity, or an over-
simplification of using L rather than AL in a summation process. The parameters suggested
by Reese et al. (1976) are from a fairly limited data base + use of some reported load-test data
of others, and the correlation is generally very good. As with any of the correlation-type data,
however, the reader should expect some scatter as more test data are accumulated—either
from errors or from natural variability in soils from different geographic regions. Further,
locally obtained parameters in these equations may provide better designs than the use of
global (of universal application) parameters.
The computation for the a coefficient for skin resistance illustrates how wide variations
can be reported in the literature (ranging from about 0.15 to 1). Here with the simple load test
discussed earlier we could obtain 0.47 or 0.60 depending on what is used for shaft length. It is
common to use a single factor for the full shaft length. In a load test where data can easily be
back-computed it might be better to use shaft segments of AL. Practice tends to simplify the
computations by using the effective shaft length and average shear strength values. Practice
also tends to use the effective shaft length and average soil parameters for piles in cohesionless
soils as well. According to Reese et al. (1976) the effective shaft length for skin resistance
should exclude the top 1.5 m (5 ft) and the bell perimeter or, for straight shafts, the bottom
1.5 m (or 5 ft).

19-5.2 Other Methods for Point Bearing Capacity
Besides using Eq. (19-6a), one can compute the pier base capacity using the Terzaghi bearing-
capacity equations from Table 4-1 as

Qa = W =

 VF(13CNC + L'yNq + 0AyBPNy) ( 1 9 "7 )
For the case of the base on either clay (4> = 0) or sand (c = 0),

(clay)

(sand)


where Ap = pier point area (bell area if one is used)
Bp = width of pier point [shaft or bell (if used)]
U = about 15 X shaft diameter for Terzaghi equations, and effective length Lp for
the Hansen equations

Meyerhof (1956) suggested equations using the SPT and CPT for the allowable bearing
capacity for spread footings for a 25-mm settlement, and with the statement they should be
doubled for pier bases. After doubling by the author these equations become

SPT: Qa = Ap-^1 **> (19-8)

CPT: Qa = Ap^ (kN) (19-9)

where qc is given in kPa.
For drilled piers socketed into rock the allowable bearing capacity qa can be computed as
in Example 4-14 of Sec. 4-16 so that the allowable point
Qa = Apqa
Drilled piers socketed into rock some depth Dr will have a substantial skin resistance capacity
as well as point bearing. This may allow using a reduced shaft diameter in this region.
The socket skin resistance capacity [see Benmokrane et al. (1994)] can be expressed as
Qs = ITBrDrX^n (MN)

where Br = shaft diameter in rock socket at depth Dr
qu = unconfined compression strength of the smaller of the rock or the pier shaft
concrete, MPa
A = adjustment factor, usually ranges between 0.2 for smooth-sided and 0.3 for
rough-sided shafts. Others have suggested values of 0.45 for fairly smooth
sides and 0.6 for rough sides.

19-5.3 General Capacity Analysis for Drilled Piers
For the usual case of a drilled pier in soil the analysis is essentially identical to that for a pile,
and the computer program PILCAPAC can be used. The two basic differences are that the
shaft is usually round (and larger than a pile) and some adjustment in the a factor must be
made if the pier is constructed by the slurry method.

(19-7fl)

We can also use the Hansen equations, where

or for 0 = 0


19-6 SETTLEMENTS OF DRILLED PIERS
The settlement of a pier is the axial shortening of the shaft + the point settlement, written as
A// - ^ A//5/ + AHp

where X Hsi = accumulation of shaft axial compression, ^ r
AHP = point settlement due both to the point bearing pressure and to settlement
caused by skin resistance

The computer program PILCAPAC in Example 16-7 and Example 19-1 (following) also
computed pier settlement by this method.
If we do not have a computer program we can estimate that the settlement should not be
more than 25 mm if the recommendations for Qpu made by Reese (1978) are followed. The
resulting design AH should be 25/SF since Qpu = ultimate value and is always divided by
an SR
We may use Meyerhof's equations [Eqs. (19-8) and (19-9)] as alternatives, which are
suggested not to give more than AH = 25 mm for the allowable design pressure qa.
We may also use the stress coefficients from Table 18-1 and our best estimate as to which
of the three table cases (1, 2, or 3) applies. From the stress influence coefficients, compute a
stress profile for a depth of influence L, «* 4 to 5B below the base and compute the average
stress increase Agav. Next make some kind of estimate for the stress-strain modulus Es in this
depth and solve the following:
AHP = eXDi = ^ i
for the point settlement term.
The methodology of program PILCAPAC will be used to illustrate both capacity and set-
tlement analysis in the following example.

Example 19-1. Use program PILCAPAC and compute the estimated ultimate pier capacity for the
"slurry" pier [one of the four "piles" tested and reported in ASCE SP No. 23 (see Finno (1989)].
See Fig. El6-la for the soil profile. This pier had a nominal 24-in. diameter shaft in the upper 9 ft
and 18 in. below. Thus, there is one ledge [the program will allow any number—you have to specify
the number of layers to the ledge and the upper and lower diameter in millimeters (or inches)]. The
concrete /c' = 6000 psi and the pier length is 50 ft. Fps units are used in this example since the
original source uses those units and it would be difficult to check results if converted to SL

Solution. A data file was created and named ASCEPL2.DTA as shown on the output sheets (Fig.
E19-1). Most of the soil data are contained in the table labeled "Soil Data for Each Layer." Although
only layers 2 through 8 provide skin resistance, nine layers are shown. The ninth (bottom) layer is
for computing point capacity. Shown are both the assumed <f> and 8 angles of the soil. The K factor
is computed as described in Example 16-7.
Note that for friction in the sand the friction angle 8 = <f> since the concrete is poured against
the soil—or at least flowed against the soil as the casing in the top depth was pulled.
The a factors are all 1.25 in the bottom three clay layers and are substantially larger than the
Reese recommendations given earlier. The value of a = 1.25 was selected for two reasons: (1) The
soil is below the GWT; the contractor had some drilling problems, so this part of the shaft may have
been enlarged somewhat (it was stated that the concrete volume was about 10 percent larger than
the theoretical shaft volume). (2) The concrete had a slump between 9 and 10 in. (a very high value),
so it would tend to give a large lateral pressure, which would in turn give a larger undrained cohesion


than that used. Rather than do a numbers shuffle (increase the shaft diameter, increase cohesion) it
was easier just to increase a.
I elected to use the Terzaghi equation for point capacity since the Hansen equation had been used
in Example 16-7.1 had to stay with the computer during execution, for the program asks how many
diameter changes occur for a drilled pier (ITYPE = 5) and the number of soil layers from the top
down to the change (here 1 change and 2 layers down from the top).

The resulting output is shown on Fig. E19-1, and we can make the following comparison:

Computed Load test
Qu = 372 kips 340 (after 4 weeks) kips
413 (after 43 weeks)
A# = 1.95 in. Between 2 and 2.5 in.

This comparison indicates that the estimated soil properties were fairly good (with aging not
considered, both 4> and a are too low); that aging is a factor; and that pile/pier loads are not easy
to predict. The use of the computer program clearly indicates that the best predictions for capacity
and settlement are made by considering the several soil layers making up a site profile rather than
trying to obtain a single site parameter such as a or /3. It is usually easier to back-compute from
known values; however, note that the <j> angles were not readjusted to obtain a better fit and the a
factor was selected with some justification.
As a final comment, there were 24 predictors for these tests and not one got a quality value. One
was about 30 percent over—the others ranged from about 50 to 60 percent of the load test. Most
did not include a ledge contribution Qi, which is larger (since it bears on the sand) than the point
capacity Qp, which is in clay.

19-7 STRUCTURAL DESIGN OF DRILLED PIERS
Since the pier shaft is supported by the surrounding soil, column slenderness effects do not
have to be considered. Thus, the design is considerably simplified. Design requirements are
usually met if the shaft diameter is large enough to carry the design load without exceeding
the allowable concrete and steel (if used) stresses.
The bell dimensions should be adequate to resist a punching failure and have adequate
bending resistance as a plain concrete member, because reinforcement would be difficult to
place.
For unreinforced pier shafts the allowable concrete stress in a number of building codes is
Sc = 0.25/; (19-10)
For ordinary reinforced drilled piers we can design conservatively as
P = Acfc + Asfs> Pd (19-11)

where At = cross-sectional areas of concrete and steel, respectively
Si = allowable concrete and steel stresses, respectively
Sc = 0.25/;
Ss = 0.40/,

In many cases the pier shaft must be designed for both bending and an axial load. This issue
is not directly addressed in most building codes nor in the ACI 318- or by ACI Committee
336. If we use the ACI 318- as a guide, a reinforced pier shaft for axial load can be designed
using the factored axial load P11 for tied rebars (usual case) as
(19-12)


For bending with axial load one should consult a textbook on reinforced concrete design of
short columns with bending since strain compatibility between concrete and steel is necessary
unless P/A + Mc/I gives compressive stress everywhere on the cross section. A round col-
umn computer program is most useful for this analysis since it is a computationally intensive
iterative process.
When the drilled pier casing is left in place it may be used to increase the shaft capacity
either by using a transformed section (At = Ag + nAs) or as
P = Acfc + As fa
where As = effective area of casing steel (after reduction for corrosion has been made).
Alternatively, the casing can be used to increase the allowable concrete stress fc as follows:
fc = 0.30/; + l-^- < o.4o/; (19-13)

where t = casing thickness after deduction for corrosion, mm or in.
D = ID of casing, mm or in.
fy = yield stress of casing steel, MPa or ksi

This recommendation is given by the Chicago Building Code (Sec. 13-132-400).

19-8 DRILLED PIER DESIGN EXAMPLES
We will illustrate some of the preceding design discussion with the following two design
examples.

Example 19-2. For the soil profile given in Fig. E19-2 we must make a trial pier design in order to
develop an economic comparison with piles. For the pier use /c' = 28 MPa with a 150-mm slump.
By inspection of the GWT elevation we see it will be necessary to use the slurry method since we
could not seal the water out of the hole with a casing socketed into the sand. The upper part of
the pier shaft will use an arbitrary 1 percent of rebars (a designer decision since only axial load is
present).
The design axial load Pd = 3000 kN.
Required. Make a preliminary design recommendation.

Solution.
Step 1. Find the approximate shaft diameter based on the allowable concrete stress of fc =
0.25/; = 0.25 X 28 = 7 MPa. Let us write
0.7854D2/c = Pd
Substituting and solving, we find
D = v S f ^ = 0-74m
Step 2. Estimate the pier length L = I I m (into dense sand), and find the estimated point capacity
neglecting any skin resistance as a first trial. Use the Reese (1978) recommendations:
qp = 4000 kPa (dense sand) Ap = 0.7854B2 ap = 2.0


Substituting into Eq. (16-6a), we obtain
_ qpAp _ 4000 X 0.7854B2 _
Qp - — — 15/1«

Since this result is for a 25-mm settlement, we can use an SF = 1 and directly solve for pier diameter
B, giving

B = TT = T S ? = 1-91 m (rather large)
At this point it would appear that we must use either a large-diameter shaft or a bell. We cannot
bell in sand, so let us look at alternatives. First, the Meyerhof equation [Eq. (19-8)] may help.
Averaging N70 for the four values in the approximate influence depth below the base, we have 24
and N55 = 24 X 70/55 = 31. Directly substituting into Eq. (19-8), we obtain
qa = AWO.052 = 31/0.052 = 596 -* 60OkPa
The required point diameter is
/ 3000
0.7854^ X 600 - 3000^ D = ^ 7 3 5 4 ^ = 2.52 m » 1.91

We might be able to obtain some skin resistance from the clay and sand layers to reduce the point
load. The L for layer 1 is L « 3.75 - 0.15 = 3.60 m; for layer 2, L « 6.75 - 3.75 = 3.0 m. Use
a = 1 for both layers (clay is both below GWT and soft). Also arbitrarily estimate the required pier
shaft = 1.372 m.
For layer 1: IT X 1.372 X 50 X 3.60 = 775 kN
For layer 2: IT X 1.372 X 38 X 3.0 = 49OkN
Total = Qsc = 1265 kN

For the sand, we estimate $ = 32° = 8; y' = 18.1 - 9.81 = 8.3 kN/m3; AL = 11.0 - 0.15 -
3.6 - 3.0 = 4.25 m; zo = H - O - 4.25/2 = 8.8 m; K = 0.60 (Reese value for L < 12 m). Then
-q-o = y'Zo = 8.3 X 8.8 = 73 kPa
Qss = Kqoten8(TT XD)M = 0.6 X 73 X tan32(7r X 1.372 X 4.25) = 501 kN
Total side resistance XQs = Qsc + Qss = 1265 + 501 = 1766 kN
Net point load Qp = Qd - X Qs = 3000 - 1766 = 1234 kN
Shaft load (concrete yc = 23.6 kN/m3) = 0.7854 X 1.3722 X 23.6 X 11
= 384 kN
Total point load = 1234 + 384 = 1618 kN
Using Eq. (19-6a) for a point settlement of 25 mm, we can write

C¥n Z X 1. J IL

We may be able to use a pier with dimensions as follows:

Shaft diameter D = 1.372 m
L = 11m

The major question is whether an a = 1.0 is valid. Note that the overall SF is rather small.

Comments,

1. This is a fairly large-diameter shaft—so is the load.
2. It would not be practical to use a bell in the clay—even if the base were on the sand, for that
sand is somewhat loose and settlement would be a problem.
3. Piles may be a more viable option since they can be driven into the dense sand and their lengths
would also be on the order of 11 m.
4. A lower /c' could be used but may not be allowed by the local code.
5. One may consider a point-bearing pier on rock if the depth is not over 30 to 35 m down and the
stratum is reasonably competent. The greater length is offset by a smaller-diameter shaft.
////

Example 19-3. Make a preliminary design for a drilled pier to be founded on the firm clay at depth
- 2 7 m of Fig. E19-3<2. The top 3.5 m of depth is in a water-bearing sand-gravel stratum. The pier
is to carry 10 500 kN, and we will use /c' = 35 MPa. Use an SF = 2 on the skin resistance, and
use a belled base if necessary.

Solution. From Fig. E19-3« estimate the base su = 145 kPa. Take the average shafts = 12OkPa.
We should actually divide the 27-m thick stratum into several layers and obtain 5Mav for each.
The dry method (Fig. 19-3) of pier installation will be used. First, a casing will be socketed into
the clay about 1 m below the sand-gravel, material for a water seal and then the shaft excavation
will proceed.
Step 1. For /c' = 35 MPa the allowable fc = 0.25 X 35 = 8.750 MPa. Also we have


(a) (b)

Figure E19-3

Step 2. Estimate the shaft friction resistance. We will try D = 1.5 m, giving a shaft perimeter
p' = TTD = 4.71 m. The effective shaft length for cohesive skin resistance is
L = L - 3.5 m of sand-gravel = 27 - 3.5 = 23.5 m
From Table 19-1 obtain the Reese value of a = 0.5, which is very conservative. From Fig. 16-14
we can obtain a = 0.7 to 0.8. We should in a real case divide the 27-m shaft into several layers,
with the top layer being about 1.5 m, the second layer 2.0 m (the sand-gravel), then layers based on
the su profile; obtain an average su for each layer and an a for each layer using either Fig. 16-14 or
Eq. (16-12a).
We could also use PILCAPAC for the analysis but obtain printouts whereby we analyze the skin
resistance and point capacity and apply a suitable SF to see if the system is adequate. That program
also allows a belled base. We would make the point layer thick enough that we could add any needed
intermediate layers with minor adjustments to the data file.
To get the general idea of pier design/analysis we will incorrectly use a single a = 0.5 for the
full shaft length.
Check that 0.5 X 120 = 60 kPa < 86, the limiting value in Table 16-1. Then

Depth, m

Shear strength, su (qjl), kPa

Rearranging and solving for a trial shaft diameter, we find


It is immediately evident that either we have to use a larger shaft, a larger a, or a bell. We will use
a bell, which reduces the shaft length for friction resistance but creates a substantial gain in point
bearing Qp. Estimate a bell height of 1.75 m, giving L' = 23.5 - 1.75 = 21.75 m and a revised
X 2« = 6 0 x 4 -7 1 x 2 L 7 5 = 615OkN
Step 3. Compute bell dimensions. We will use an SF = 2 on the skin resistance. Noting that Reese
suggests using Qp/3 to provide a bearing value so the settlement AH < 25 mm, we find
_ su X 9 X Ap _ 145 X 9 X 0.7854Pg _ 2

The bell must carry Pb = 10500 - 6150/2 = 7425 kN. Equating these expressions, we find
341.65Z)J = 7425 -> D* = ^^^5 = 4 6 6 m
Use Db = 4.75 m to find Db/Ds = 4.75/1.5 = 3.17, which is close to the maximum allowed. The
revised bell depth (see Fig. E\9-3b for geometry) is
Hb = 0.15 + (4.75 - 1.5O)/2 = 1.775 m - 1.75 used (O.K.)
Step 4. Check potential ground loss from possible "squeezing."
For this we will estimate ywet = 19.8 kN/m3 and y' = 10 kN/m3 for full shaft length. Thus,
At 10 m depth: p'o = 10(y') = 10(10) = 100 kPa
su = 120, giving ^- = I ^ = 0.83 « 6 to 8
Sn 1 ZXJ
At 20 m depth: p'o = 25(10) = 250 kPa
su = 120, giving ^s. = ^ = 2.5 < 6 to 8

It appears that ground loss from squeezing will not be a problem here.
Step 5. Check axial shortening—use the effective shaft length = 27-1.775 = 25.2 m even though
a part is the "bell." Assume the average shaft load P = X Qsi — 6150: Then
A5 = 0.7854 X 1.52 = 1.767 m2
Ec = 4700 JfJ (Table 8-3)
= 4700(35)°5 = 27 800 MPa
The axial shortening is
PL 6150(25.2)
A / / - = A ^ = 1.767(27 800) = 3 - 2 m m
Since the point should displace not more than 25 mm the total immediate A// of the pier should not
exceed 30 mm; any consolidation settlement would be additional.
Summary.
Use the dry method with a casing to about 5 m depth.
Use D = 1.50 m (Fig. E19-36).
Use B = 4.75 m.
Total settlement under 30 mm.
Squeezing or ground loss does not seem a problem.


19-9 LATERALLY LOADED DRILLED PIER ANALYSIS
Laterally loaded drilled piers can be analyzed using program FADBEMLP (B-5). There is
some opinion that a short rigid pier is so stiff that the shaft will rigidly rotate about a point
designated the center of rotation (see Fig. 19-8) and that a resisting moment will develop
on the base from the toe and heel pressure profiles qualitatively shown. This moment is not
accounted for in the usual FEM lateral pile program (unless we inspect the output from a trial
run and arbitrarily select a possible base moment, which is input as an additional base node
load on a subsequent trial).
It is immediately evident that if Fig. 19-8 is a correct representation of rigid pier-soil
interaction, modeling it would be nearly impossible in any FEM/FD computer program unless
one has a load test for a guide. In the author's opinion this model is not likely to develop unless
the pier Lp/D ratio is less than about 2 except at lateral loads far in excess of the design load,
e.g., lateral load tests are commonly taken to the limiting resistance of the pile or pier where
the design load may only be one-fourth to one-half the ultimate load. Very short stub piers
with Lp/D less than about 2 can probably be analyzed as footings with a passive pressure on
the shaft about as accurately as trying to treat the stub pier as a rigid laterally loaded pier.
For larger Lp/D ratios the pier shaft, being substantially stiffer than the soil, will carry
the lateral force similar to a laterally loaded pile. In any case, one can make a lateral pile-
type analysis and inspect the output displacement of the bottom node. If there is a horizontal

tion with rotation angle 6 greatly exaggerated.
The toe and heel pressures will be highly in-
determinate. Whereas toe pressure is nearly
vertical, the heel pressure has both horizon-
tal and vertical components, giving the slope
shown.

displacement in the load direction much over 1 or 2 mm the analytical model may be inade-
quate or the lateral load is too large for the pier-soil system.
Lateral load tests on drilled piers of small Lp/D ratios tend to confirm that the base rotation
of Fig. 19-8 is seldom of consequence. For example, Bhushan et al. (1978) report test results
of a series of short drilled piers in the range of Lp/D = 15/4 = 3.75 to 22/4 = 5.5. Some of
the 1.22-m diameter shafts had 1.677-m diameter bells installed. They reported no discernible
difference in capacity for shafts with bells versus no bells. Davisson and Salley (1968) re-
ported the results of four laterally loaded test piers. For lateral loads up to about 450 kN
the differences between the displacements of belled and straight-shaft piers were negligible.
At near ultimate loads, however, the displacement differences were noticeable, with the bell
tending to reduce the lateral displacement. Referring to Fig. 19-8 we see that in a rigid shaft
rotation any bell should decrease rotation and increase the lateral load capacity of the pier.
To illustrate that the lateral pile FEM provides a reasonable solution, we will analyze a
laterally loaded short drilled pier reported by Bhushan and Askari (1984). By citing a refer-
ence I do not use an excessive amount of text space for test details, and the reader can gain
experience in trying to follow the work of others in developing his or her own experience base.
Bhushan et al. (1978) and Bhushan and Askari (1984) suggested that predicted displace-
ments (that is, values computed in some manner) are in the range of two to six times measured
values for laterally loaded piers. It should be noted in passing that a number of methods have
been suggested in the ASCE Geotechnical Journal. Obviously if some of these give predic-
tions in error by a factor of six [and most suggestions have been made since about 1960]
they were worthless to begin with and should not have been published. The author readily
concedes, however, that it is common at a site with similar piers (or piles) for lateral load
test measurements to differ by ± 20 percent—sometimes more. The cause is the natural het-
erogeneity of the soil, which prompted the author to comment in Sec. 16-14 that one should
not spend great effort in exactly matching a load test for site parameters. Any parameters ob-
tained in this manner are strictly applicable for that test, and if they happen to match values
for an adjacent test it is more a happy coincidence than computational rigor.
What one should try to do with load-test data is obtain average site parameters that are,
one hopes, in an easy-to-use format so that changes can be made using commonly used soil
parameters such as <f> and su.
If you have a pier located on a slope refer to Sec. 16-15 for the necessary methodology to
estimate the lateral modulus of subgrade reaction ks.
Example 19-4. Use your computer program FADBEMLP and analyze pier No. 1 of Table 1 of
Bhushan and Askari (1984). Figure E19-4a illustrates the general test setup as interpreted by the
author. Figure E19-4£ is the FEM used. The second node at 0.2 m from top was included since the
lateral displacement of this node was given in Table 3 of the reference, which summarized the test
results.

Solution, Obtain soil parameters as needed. The reference gave (f> = 36° and an average y = 99
pcf, which the author rounds to y = 16 kN/m3 since we will use all SI units. The load cases were
given as follows:

Figure E19-4c {continued)


With these data for input (see data set EXAM194.DTA on your diskette), we obtain the computer
output shown on Fig. E19-4c. The displacements are summarized as follows:

LC Measured 8h, mm Computed Sh9 mm R= M e S e d

1 0.074 0.09 1.22
2 0.163 0.16 1.00
3 0.0351 0.32 0.91

Discussion of output

1. The computed output compares quite well with the load test values. The foregoing data repre-
sent some revisions to the execution given in the fourth edition; that is, ks is adjusted for factor
Cm, an improved (smaller) Fwi is used, and we have taken into account that the ks should be
representative of the small displacements (under \ in.) of this system.
2. With such a large shaft and such small lateral loads, the computed and measured 8h are almost
meaningless. What one generally hopes to avoid is a measured 8h = 50 mm when the computed
value is only 20 or 25 mm.
3. The equation for ks is not an "after the fact" development, so it can be used with reasonable
confidence for other cases.
4. One might question if a shaft diameter this large should be considered a "deep" beam.
5. The program makes several self-checks, so it would seem it is making correct computations—or
at least correct for this set of input.
6. The displacements at the bottom three nodes are either zero or so near zero that we can say they
are. That is, the shaft- -at least in this load range—is behaving similarly to any laterally loaded
pile.
7. The ground line moment (node 3) is readily checked for all three cases as simply the input
moment +0.56P/J. For LC = 3 we obtain
Mgl = 86.64 + 0.56 X 18.37 = 96.92 kN • m
as on the output sheet for node 3.

19-10 DRILLED PIER INSPECTION AND LOAD TESTING
The drilled pier (or caisson) usually carries a very large load, so structural integrity is an ab-
solute necessity. This is partially achieved by an inspection of the shaft cavity. When the shaft
is cased, a person may enter to check the base for loose material. If the base is in rock, it can
be checked for cracks or voids and loose material; however, present technology is at a state
where equipment is available to precondition the shaft sides and to clean the base of loose
material. When the base is on soil, it is often desirable to check the bearing capacity manually
(and visually), using a pocket penetrometer to obtain the unconfined compression strength qu
at a number of points similar to the testing illustrated in Fig. 3-9a. A visual comparison of the
actual shaft soil with the original boring logs is of much value. Usually at this point it is not too
late to make a rapid redesign if the shaft soil is found to be different from the original borings.
When the shaft is not cased, the diameter is too small for an inspector to enter, or hazardous
gas is being emitted, it may be possible to lower a video camera to obtain an indirect visual


check of shaft conditions. If a video camera is not available, it may be possible to get some
indication of shaft condition and vertical alignment by lowering a light into the cavity. If the
light disappears, the shaft is not vertical; soil crumbs may be visible on the pier base soil (if
the shaft is vertical and not too deep); the condition of the shaft sides may be visible at least
in the upper part.
It is usually specified that the inspector do at least the following:

1. Perform a specified number of slump tests on the wet concrete.
2. Take a specified number of concrete cylinders for later strength testing.
3. Observe and compare the volume of concrete placed in the pier shaft (and bell if used) to
the shaft volume. It is self-evident that if less than the shaft volume of concrete is placed,
there is some kind of discontinuity in the shaft. This is usually the first verification of pier
integrity.

There are electronic test devices [see, for example, Lin et al. (1991)] that can measure a
seismic wave down the shaft after the concrete has hardened (nondestructive testing, NDT) to
ascertain whether any voids or discontinuities are present. A core sample is considered to be
more reliable, but it is usually too costly (and permanently damages the pier some amount);
it may be done if the concrete strength /c' is suspect or if litigation is pending.
The ACI committee 336 has two current specifications, titled Standard Specification for
the Construction of Drilled Piers and Design and Construction of Drilled Piers, which can
be obtained from the ACI; they give a number of suggested inspection procedures to ensure
the quality of the drilled pier.

Pier load testing. Load-testing a drilled pier for its capacity is a difficult task, since large
piers carry substantial load and conventional testing, similar to that for piles, requires a large
load frame (see Fig. Yl-Ic).
A recent development is to put a high-capacity hydraulic jack, termed an O-cell, onto a
plate 1 on the base soil of the pier (shaft or bell), and an upper plate 2 against which the
bell/shaft is poured. Hydraulic and electronic pickup lines are routed to the ground surface
for later use. When the pier concrete hardens, the jack is activated to attempt to separate
plates 1 and 2; the resistance can be related to point bearing. If the lower plate 1 has been
referenced to a known elevation (a surface reference frame), the change in elevation caused
by the jack load is related to point settlement and to side skin resistance. This pier load test is
termed an O-test (also an upside-down load test, because the load is applied at the base and
pier movement is upward) and has been in use since about 1985 [Goodwin (1993), Meyer
and Schade (1995)].

PROBLEMS
In any economic analysis assume /c' costs ($100/7 MPa per m3) over the base strength of 21 MPa—that
is, 28 MPa costs $100/m3 more than 21 MPa strength concrete; 35 MPa is $200/m3 more, etc.
19-1. Compute a for the three 9-m AL increments of clay in Example 19-1.
19-2. In Example 19-1 what 4> angle for the sand layers together with a = 0.5 for the 27 m of clay
and the computed point value would give the load test value Pu ~ 410 kN? Is this angle realistic
(you should try to obtain a copy of the original source)?


19-3. Using the given 4> angles and a — 0.5, what su would you have to use to give the load test
value of Pu ~ 410 kN for Example 19-1? Remember the point value also changes, so that Qp
must also be recomputed.
19-4. Verify the skin resistance computations shown on Fig. E19-1.
19-5. Compare the quantity of concrete required in Example 19-2 to that required if we extended the
shaft to bedrock at 33 m below the ground surface and the rock qa = 28 MPa.
19-6. What shaft diameter would be required for the drilled pier of Example 19-2 with the point at
- 2 1 m elevation?
19-7. For Example 19-3, what shaft length is required to eliminate the need for a bell? Would it be
more economical to increase the shaft diameter DsI Use a single a as in the example.
19-8. Redo Example 19-3 using at least four clay layers instead of one and compute a for each layer
using Eq. (16-12a). Use Qp = Quit/3 for the point contribution and skin resistance SF = 2 as
in the example.
19-9. Would the drilled pier of Example 19-3 be more economical using /c' = 28 MPa (example uses
35 MPa)?
19-10. Design a drilled pier for a column load of 4500 kN using the soil profile shown in Fig. P19-10.
Soil data is from "undrained" tests.

19-11. Design a drilled pier for the soil profile of Fig. P19-11 for a 5000-kN axial load. Use a bell if it
will be more economical.

value for these piers?
19-14. Redo Example 19-4 using / = 0.0370 m4 (a 10 percent increase from the example) to allow
some increase in stiffness for the rebar cage. If we assume the pier contained 15 No. 20 rebars
on a radius of 0.70 m, what is the computed moment of inertia Il How does this compare to the
moment of inertia of the gross section actually used of 0.03366 m4?
19-15. Redo Example 19-4 using the exponent n = 0.4, 0.75, and 1.0. Compare your results with the
output given (which used n = 0.5). Plot Ph versus 8h for each n value onto the same curve
together with the measured values for a visual comparison.

20-1 INTRODUCTION
Foundations supporting reciprocating engines, compressors, radar towers, punch presses, tur-
bines, large electric motors and generators, etc. are subject to vibrations caused by unbalanced
machine forces as well as the static weight of the machine. If these vibrations are excessive,
they may damage the machine or cause it not to function properly. Further, the vibrations may
adversely affect the building or persons working near the machinery unless the frequency and
amplitude of the vibrations are controlled.
The design of foundations for control of vibrations was often on the basis of increasing
the mass (or weight) of the foundation and/or strengthening the soil beneath the foundation
base by using piles. This procedure generally works; however, the early designers recognized
that this often resulted in considerable overdesign. Not until the 1950s did a few foundation
engineers begin to use vibration analyses, usually based on a theory of a surface load on an
elastic half-space. In the 1960s the lumped mass approach was introduced, the elastic half-
space theory was refined, and both methods were validated.
The principal difficulty in vibration analysis now consists in determining the necessary
soil values of shear modulus G' and Poisson's ratio JUL for input into the differential equation
solution that describes vibratory motion. The general methods for design of foundations, both
shallow and deep, that are subject to vibration (but not earthquakes) and for the determination
of the required soil variables will be taken up in some detail in the following sections.

20-2 ELEMENTS OF VIBRATION THEORY
A solid block base rests in the ground as in Fig. 20-1. The ground support is shown replaced
by a single soil spring. This is similar to the beam-on-elastic-foundation case except the
beam uses several springs and the foundation base here only uses one. Also this spring is

for dynamic loading and will be computed differently from the beam problem. As we shall
later see, the spring will be frequency-dependent as well.
Here the soil spring has compressed under the static weight of the block an amount

W
Zs = ^ (a)

At this time zs and the spring Kz are both static values. Next we give the block a quick solid
shove in the z direction with a quick release, at which time the block begins to move up and
down (it vibrates). Now the zs and soil Kz are dynamic values.
We probably could not see the movement, but it could be measured with sensitive elec-
tronic measuring equipment. After some time the block comes to rest at a slightly larger
displacement z's as shown in Fig. 20-1. The larger displacement is from the vibration
producing a state change in the soil (a slightly reduced void ratio or more dense particle
packing).
We can write the differential equation to describe this motion [given in any elementary
dynamics or mechanical vibration textbook (as Den Hartog (1952)], using the terms shown
in Fig. 20-Ia in a form of F = ma to give, in one dimension,
ml + Kzz = 0 (b)
Solving by the methods given in differential equation textbooks after dividing through by
the mass term m and defining co2n = Kz/m, we can obtain the period of vibration T as

COn
and the natural frequency fn as any one of the following
f = «-!=_LS=_LS_j_/T (201)
2TT 2 TT \ m /7TV W 2rry zs
From Eq. (b) it would appear that the vibration will continue forever; we know from expe-
rience that this is not so. There must be some damping present, so we will add a damping
device termed a dashpot (analog = automobile shock absorbers) to the idealized model. To
maintain symmetry we will add half the dashpot to each edge of the base as in Fig. 20-Xb.

Dashpots are commonly described as developing a restoring force that is proportional to the
velocity (z) of the mass being damped. With this concept for the dashpot force a vertical force
summation gives the following differential equation
m'z + czz + Kzz = 0 (c)
Solving this equation, we obtain the general form of the instantaneous dynamic displacement
z as
z = Cxe^ + C2 ^2 ' (d)
where
r Pl] -cz±Jcl-4Kzm = Zcz^ K f _ K1

From the /3 values we note that the V term is one of the following:
Case 1. No damping (< 0)—gives Eq. (20-1) when cz = 0.
Case 2. Overdamped (> 0) with c\ > 4Kzm (see Fig. 20-2).
Case 3. Critically damped (= 0) with c\ = 4Kzm. We define the critical damping as
Cz1C = 2mo)n = 2 y/Kzm

Figure 20-2 Plot of time-displacement curves for three types of damped movement. The plot is relative since
the natural frequency is constant and <ot is to the same scale. The variable in the three plots is the damping factor.

(a) Overdamped V/T*

(b) Critical damping N /5~

(c) Underdamped yJ~^


Case 4. Underdamped (< O) when c\ < 4Kzm. This is the usual case in foundation vibra-
tions since case 1 is impossible (even the spring Kz will have some internal damping) and
vibrations rapidly dissipate in cases 2 and 3 as shown in Fig. 20-2.

From case 3 we can define a damping ratio Z); as
Dz = cz/cZtC (here i = z) (20-2)
and the damped circular frequency (od from a reordering of the v term of Eq. (e)
cod = yri / ^ _ ( W (20_3)
Since w2 = KJm and c\ — D\c\c, we can obtain an alternative form as
(od = (On V l -Dl (20-3a)
The v —1 disappears, since D1 < 1.
In the general vibrating base case, however, we have a base load consisting of a large
weight colliding with an anvil as in a punch press, a piece of rotating machinery, or an op-
erating engine. The engine in turn may drive a piece of equipment such as a compressor or
pump. Any of these latter can have the effect of an unbalanced force (or several forces) rotat-
ing about an axis such as a crankshaft (see Fig. 20-3). From elementary dynamics a mass me
connected to a shaft with an arm of y rotating at a circular frequency of (o produces a force
at any instant in time of
Fi = meya)2
If the operating frequency is coo it is evident that the force F1- is varying from zero to the
maximum at the operating speed, after which it is a constant. It is also evident that along the
particular axis of interest the foregoing force will vary as
F = Fosina)t or as F = F0cosa)t
In these cases we rewrite Eq. (c) as
ml + czz + Kzz = F(O {f)
Using the same methods as for Eqs. (b) and (c), we obtain the following for the case of
F = F0 SiW(Ot—the maximum z occurs at (ot = ±TT/2 radians -^ F0 X I = F0:
z = F° (2Q-Aa)
J(K1 - ma)2)2 + c2z(o2
After factoring Kz and making substitutions for m and cz, we obtain the following:
z = Fo/Kz (20-46)
V[I - ((o/(on)2]2 + (2Dz(o/(on)2
Note that Kz is a static soil spring for co = 0 and is a dynamic value when (o > 0—in other
words, Kz = f((o). If the radical in the denominator of Eq. (20-46) is written as


then by setting the derivative dA/da = O we obtain the maximum value of dynamic z possible
in the form (and using zs = static displacement = Fo/Kz) as
z™ " iBj^B! <20-5)
The resonant frequency fr is obtained as
fr = fn V l - 2D2Z (2°-6)
where fn is defined by Eq. (20-1). Here resonance is somewhat below the natural base fre-
quency /„. Use F0 = constant or F0 = meyco20 in these equations. When F0 = meyco2 the
resonance frequency can be computed as

/; - TAS «"">
which gives a resonance frequency above the natural frequency /„.
It is sometimes useful to obtain curves of relative displacement versus a frequency ratio
as in Fig. 20-4. In this case we can rewrite Eq. (20-4&) to obtain an amplitude ratio of

Zs \fnj
It is about as easy, however, to program Eq. (20-4a), simply vary F0 = meya)2, and di-
rectly compute the zlzs ratio—particularly since both Kz and cz are frequency-dependent.
The values of Af and N' for a range of / / / „ = 0 to 3 and for several values of damping ratio
D = 0, 0.1, etc. are shown in Fig. 20-4. The most significant feature is that N ranges from 1
to a peak at f/fn slightly less than 1 and approaches zero at large / / / „ where a frequency-
dependent force produces an N' that starts at zero, peaks slightly beyond f/fn = 1, and then
flattens toward 1 at large f/fn-
For vibration analyses we can directly use Eq. (20-4a) if we have values of soil spring Kz
and damping coefficient cz and can reasonably identify the block mass (W/g) that includes
the base and all permanent attachments. We also must have a value of F0. We do not usually
use the force F = F0 sin cot since we are interested in the maximum z and at some instant in
time sin cot = 1 so F = F0, but we do have to be aware the vibration displacement oscillates

Carefully note that within the terms / and co in the frequency ratios are the frequencies

system frequencies.

20-3 THE GENERAL CASE OF A VIBRATING BASE
Figure 20-5 illustrates the general case of a foundation with 6 d.o.f. of vibration/excitation
modes possible. From this figure we can have

Translations: 3 modes along the JC, y, and z axes
Rotations: 3 modes about the x, y, and z axes

The rotations about the x and y axes are usually termed rocking modes and the z axis rotation
is termed yawing.

Figure 20-5 Rectangular foundation block with 6 degrees of freedom.

OL2 = yawing
OLx, (xy = rocking
Ax, Ay, Az = translation


There are three procedures currently used to analyze these vibration modes:

a. Elastic half-space theory [outlined by Sung (1953)]
b. Analog methods [as given by Richart et al. (1970)]
c. Lumped mass or lumped parameter method (as given in the preceding section)

After an extensive literature survey and review of the several methods the author decided
that the lumped mass approach is at least as reliable and substantially more general than
any of the alternative procedures. Current state-of-art allows adjustments to the spring and
damping constants for frequency. The same soil data are required as for any of the alternative
procedures, and the method is rather simple, for it is only necessary to program Eq. (20-4a)
to increment the frequency of the engine/machine to obtain the corresponding displacement
amplitudes and see if any are too large for the particular equipment. Of course it is also
necessary to obtain certain data, as subsequently noted, as input along with soil parameters.
It is particularly helpful to use a computer program to do most of the work because this type
of problem is computationally intensive—particularly when making parametric studies.
By direct analogy of Eq. (J) we can write differential equations as follows:

For sliding modes:

mx + cxx + KxX = Fx(timt)
my + Cy y + Kyy = Fy (time)

For rocking modes:

hfi + CQ1Q + KdiQ = Fdi(time)

Since the differential equation is similar in form for all cases we have a general solution in
Eq. (20-4a) with appropriate entries for Kz, cz, and m as follows:

Axis Spring Damping Mass, JW,- =

Translation modes

x Kx Cx mx = m
y Ky Cy my = m
z K1 cz mz = m = W/g

Rocking and yawing modes

X K6x CQX IQX
y K6y CQy I6y
Z KQZ CQZ IQZ

where W = weight of base + all machinery and other attachments that will vibrate with the
base; g = gravitation constant (9.807 or 32.2).
Values of Iei can be computed using formulas given in Table 20-1 or from methods given
in most dynamics textbooks. The mass m used in these equations is the same for all translation
modes. Most mass moments of inertia will be composites in which the transfer formula will
be required; however, the total mass m will be the same in all the modes.


The soil spring (K1) and damping (c,) terms can be computed by a number of procedures,
all giving slight to major computed differences in vibration displacements. Fortunately the
spring and damping effects are under the square root of Eq. (20-4) so the estimation effect
is somewhat reduced. We would not like, however, to compute a displacement of, say, 0.001
mm and have the value be 0.01 mm, which results in the machine supported by the base
becoming damaged from excessive base movements.

20-4 SOIL SPRINGS AND DAMPING CONSTANTS
Barkan (1962) is a frequently cited source for soil springs. Other references such as Richart
et al. (1970) and Novak and Beredugo (1972) also give methods to compute spring values.
Dobry and Gazetas (1986) made an extensive literature survey for methods to compute the
spring and damping constants and plotted the values from the several sources versus a di-
mensionless frequency factor ao and produced a series of best-fit curves. They then compared

Figure 20-6 Factor Ja = A/4L2 for several geometric shapes. Note axis orientation in all cases, and length = 2L
and width = IB.

Carefully note that the base width defined in Fig. 20-6 is 2B, so the B value used in this
equation is half the base width (analogous to ro for a round base). Here co is the frequency of
the machine and not the system natural frequency.
In most cases the foundation base being dynamically excited is not round with a radius
ro but, rather, is rectangular—often with an L/B of 2 to 5. The solutions generally published
prior to those of Dobry and Gazetas required converting the rectangular (or other) shape to
an equivalent round base, equivalent being defined as a round base with the same area in
plan as in the actual base. Solution quality deteriorated as the L/B ratio increased as would
be expected since the equivalent round foundation would become a poor model at larger L/B
ratios. Observe that in using the Dobry and Gazetas method we would make a better model by
converting a round base to an equivalent square than by converting a square to an equivalent
round base.
This method uses a base of dimensions IB X 2L as shown on Fig. 20-6. Note very carefully
that the circumscribed base width is 2B and the length is 2L. This gives the plan area directly
as 2B X 2L only for solid rectangles. For all other bases one must obtain the circumscribed
dimensions and then compute the actual base area by any practical means (perhaps by using
the sum of several components consisting of squares, triangles, etc.).
Similarly in this method it may be necessary, in computing certain of the soil springs, to
use the plan moment of inertia about the x, y, or z axes. This computation gives for a solid
rectangle

Triangle Square Rectangle

Circle

Semicircle Ellipse

and


From Fig. 20-6 we see that 2L is always parallel to the x axis, giving LIB > 1. The factor
1.333 = H since we use IB X IL. When the circumscribed dimensions are not completely
filled in, it is necessary to compute the moment of inertia about any axis (Ix is about the x
axis, etc.) using the sum of the component parts and the transfer of axes formula as necessary.
Another constant used by this procedure is
Arpo
Ja = A o (dimensionless) (20-8)
AL1
with several values of Ja shown on Fig. 20-6.
In using the method it is necessary first to compute the static spring values using the curve
fit values given in Table 20-2 and, for damping, values from Table 20-4 to obtain
Spring: Kj Damping: C1-
These values are then multiplied by frequency-dependent factors 17/ obtained from Fig.
20-1 a, by c (as appropriate) and by A7 factors from curve-fitted equations in Table 20-4 (done
by the author for computer programming convenience). These factors then give the dynamic
springs and damping coefficients as

densed from Dobry and Gazetas (1985).
These dynamic spring K1 and damping c,- are based on a perfectly elastic soil with zero ma-
terial damping. Experimental evidence indicates that even at very small strains soil exhibits
a material (or hysteretic) damping. This is usually specified using a frequency-independent
damping ratio D1- (see Eq. 20-2) that is used to adjust Ki and c/ further according to Lysmer
as cited by Dobry and Gazetas (1986) as follows:
K1 = Ki - (OC1Di (20-9)

Ci = Ci + ^ ^ i (20-10)
(X)
These values of K1 and c,- are used in Eq. (20-4) or its variations depending on whether there
is translation or rocking.
Values of material damping D1- are considered in Sec. 20-5.3.
From the discussion to this point it is evident that the only really practical way to solve
vibration problems is to use a computer program. In a computer program it is necessary to do
the following:

1. Allow input of the problem parameters (base data, soil data, and dynamic force data).
2. Compute the static spring and damping and the dynamic factors 77, and A1- as appropriate
for that mode. Use Fig. 20-7 for the 77; factors.
3. Compute the dynamic spring and damping values using Eqs. (20-9) and (20-10).


(c) Sliding r)y and torsion rjr factors. All torsion factors
are r\t < 1.

Figure 20-7 {continued)

4. Solve Eq. (20-4a) for the displacement amplitude or Eq. (20-4Z?) for the magnification
factor to apply to the static displacement.
5. Output sufficient results so a spot check for correctness can be made.

To accomplish these requirements, FADDYNFl (B-Il) is provided on your program
diskette. This program directly uses the equations for a rectangular base given in Tables
20-2 and 20-3. A curve-fitting (regression-type) analysis was used to obtain a best fit of the
curves of Fig. 20-7 with the coefficients directly programmed for the r// values. A similar
curve-fitting scheme was used to produce Table 20-4 from the cited reference (without pro-
viding the figures in the text to conserve space). The coefficients were then programmed in
the several subroutines in the program so that A1- could be obtained. A linear interpolation
between curves is used for intermediate values of L/B.

The program should generally be limited to L/B < 5. One should check the range of L/B
given either in Fig. 20-7 or in Table 20-4 since certain vibration modes may allow a larger
L/B. The range of ao should be limited to between zero and 1.5 (usual range provided in most
literature sources), which should cover nearly all likely base designs. For ao to exceed 1.5 one
would have a very high speed machine (large (o) and/or a small ground shear wave velocity
Vs. In these cases some kind of soil strengthening or the use of piles may be necessary if
vibration control is critical.

20-5 SOIL PROPERTIES FOR DYNAMIC BASE DESIGN
The soil spring constants shown in Table 20-2 directly depend on the dynamic soil shear
modulus G' and Poisson's ratio /x. The unit weight ys is needed to compute the soil density
p as
p = y,/9.807 kN • s2/m4 (SI and ys in kN/m3)
p = y/32.2 k • s2/ft4 (Fps and ys in k/ft3)
It is usual to estimate /JL in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 as done in Chap. 5 for foundation settlements.
We note that the dynamic coefficients r\z and r)y also depend on /x; however, here only two
values—0.333 and 0.50—can be used (as programmed in the computer program). These
two values are probably sufficient for most problems since /x is estimated and not directly
measured.
The unit weight of a cohesive soil can be directly measured using the procedures outlined
in Example 2-1. In other cases it can generally be estimated with sufficient precision using
Table 3-4 or simply be taken as between 17 and 20 kN/m3 (or 110 to 125 lb/ft3). Larger
values for ys can be justified for a dynamic analysis as no one would place a base on loose
soil. The soil would be either densified or stiffened with admixtures, soil-cement piles, or
stone columns; or the base would be placed on piles.
20-5.1 Laboratory Determination of Gf
The shear modulus can be estimated from resonant-column tests. These involve a laboratory
apparatus consisting of a specially constructed triaxial cell capable of providing a very small

Anderson et al. (1978) and others indicate that Eqs. (20-12) and (20-12a) are likely to
underpredict G' in situ by a factor from 1.3 to 2.5 since they do not include the stiffening
effects from cementation and anisotropy. On the other hand, Kim and Novak (1981) found
for several Canadian clays and silts that Eq. (20-12a) overpredicted G' by a factor of about
2. Typical values of G' as found by several researchers are given in Table 20-5 as a guide or
for preliminary estimates of vibration amplitudes.
One cannot use static triaxial test values of Es to compute dynamic values of G', since the
strain 6^ for the dynamic G' is on the order of 0.002 to 0.00001 (or less) where triaxial strains
€tr are usually recorded (and plotted) in the range of 0.01+.
20-5.2 In Situ Determination of Dynamic Shear Modulus G
In an elastic, homogeneous soil mass dynamically stressed at a point near the surface, three
elastic waves travel outward at different speeds. These are as follows:
Compression (or P) wave
Shear (or secondary S) wave—usually wave of interest
Surface (or Rayleigh) wave
The velocity of the Rayleigh wave is about 10 percent less than that of the shear wave.
For surface measurements it is often used in lieu of the shear wave owing to the complex
waveform displayed on the pickup unit from these nearly simultaneous wave arrivals. The
wave peaks on the waveform are used to indicate wave arrival so the time of travel from shock
source to detection unit can be computed. Compression and shear wave velocities are related
to the dynamic elastic constants of the soil according to Theory of Elasticity as follows:

Compression: (20-14)


Shear: Vs = — (20-15)
V p
The relationship between shear modulus G' and stress-strain modulus E5 is the same as for
static values and is given by Eq. (b) of Sec. 2-14, repeated here for convenience with a slight
rearrangement:
E5 = 2(1 + /x)G'
Dividing Eq. (20-15) by Eq. (2-14), squaring, substituting, and simplifying, we obtain

$ - ^>
From Eq. (20-16) we see the shear wave ranges from
0 < Vs < OJOlVc
depending on Poisson's ratio /x. From this it is evident the compression waves will arrive at
the detection unit some time before the shear and surface waves arrive.
The shear modulus can be obtained by making field measurements of the shear wave
velocity Vs and by using Eq. (20-15) to find
G' = pV]
In addition to the direct measurement of the Rayleigh surface shear wave and using Eq.
(20-15) to compute G', one can obtain the shear wave velocity V5 in situ using any one of a
number of tests such as the up-hole, down-hole, cross-hole, bottom-hole, in-hole, and seismic
cone penetration [see Robertson and Addo (1991), which includes a large reference list de-
scribing the tests in some detail]. More recently (ca. 1984) a modification of the surface wave
method, termed the spectral analysis of surface wave (SASW) method, has been suggested.
The cross-hole and down-hole methods for the in situ shear wave velocity Vs are described
in considerable detail by Woods (1986, with large number of references).

CROSS-HOLE METHOD. In the cross-hole method (see Fig. 20-8a) two boreholes a known
distance apart are drilled to some depth, preferably on each side of the base location so that
the shear wave can be measured between the two holes and across the base zone.
At a depth of about B a sensor device is located in the side or bottom of one hole and a
shock-producing device (or small blast) in the other. A trigger is supplied with the shock so
that the time for the induced shear wave can be observed at the pickup unit. The time of travel
Th of the known distance Dh between the two holes gives the shear wave velocity Vs (in units
of Dh) as

Th
DOWN-HOLE METHOD. The down-hole method is similar to the cross-hole but has the
advantage of only requiring one boring, as shown on Fig. 20-8&. In this method, the hole is
drilled, and a shock device is located a known distance away. A shock detector is located at
some known depth in the hole and a shock applied. As with the cross-hole method, we can
measure the time Th for arrival of the shear wave and, by computing the diagonal side of the
triangle, obtain the travel distance Dh. The detector device is then placed at a greater depth
and the test repeated, etc., until a reasonably average value of Vs is obtained. Hoar and Stokoe


Figure 20-8 Two recommended in situ methods for obtaining shear modulus G'.
(1978) discuss in some detail precautionary measures to take in making either of these two
tests so that the results can justify the test effort.

SEISMIC CONE METHOD. This method directly measures the shear wave velocity by in-
corporating a small velocity seismometer (an electronic pickup device) inside the cone pen-
etrometer. Essentially, the test proceeds by pushing the seismic cone to some depth z and then
applying a shock at the ground surface, using a hammer and striking plate or similar. This
method seems to have been developed ca. 1986 [see Robertson et al. (1986)]. This device has
the advantage of not requiring a borehole. It requires that the site soil be suitable for a CPT
(fine-grained, with little to no gravel).

SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF SURFACE WAVES (SASW) METHOD. This is a modification
of the seismic surface method based on the dispersive characteristics of Rayleigh waves in
layered media. It involves applying a vibration to the soil surface, measuring the wave speed
between two electronic pickup devices a known distance apart, and then interpreting the data.
The test procedure and early development is described in substantial detail by Nazarian and
Desai (1993); the theory and use by Yuan and Nazarian (1993). An in-depth test program
based on the SASW by Lefebvre et al. (1994) found that empirical correlations based on
laboratory tests and using void ratio, OCR, and the mean effective stress cro as equation
parameters may substantially underpredict the dynamic shear modulus G'.
The SASW has particular value in not requiring a borehole or a large amount of field
equipment.

SHEAR WAVE-G' CORRELATIONS. Schmertmann (1978a) suggests that Vs may be related
to the SPT TV value or to the CPT qc. From a plot of a large number of TV values at a test site
in sand, he suggested that Vs ~ 15A^o—for that site. From this it appears that
V5 = 10 to 2(W60 (m/s) (20-17)
with the range to account for increasing density, fine or coarse sand and other variables. Use
Table 20-5 as an additional guide.
Seed et al. (1986) and later Jamiolkowski et al. (1988) suggested that the shear velocity is
approximately
Vs = C1Nl011Z0^2F1F2 (m/s) (20-17*)
where C\ = empirical constant; Seed et al. (1986) suggested 69; Jamiolkowski et al. (1988)
suggested 53.5
z = depth in soil where blow count A^o is taken, m
Fi = age factor:
= 1 for Holocene age (alluvial deposits)
= 1.3 for Pleistocene age (diluvial deposits)
F2 = soil factor as follows:

Fine Med Coarse Sand &
Clay sand sand sand Gravel Gravel
F2 = 1.0 1.09 1.07 1.11 1.15 1.45

Yoshida et al. (1988) give an equation for V8 as follows:
Vs = C{(yz)0A4№6025 m/s (20-176)
where yz = average overburden pressure in depth z of interest, kPa
C\ — coefficient depending on soil type as follows:

Soil Fine sand 2 5 % Gravel 5 0 % Gravel AU soils
Ci = 49 56 60 55


The Vs estimate from Eqs. (20-17) are then used together with an estimated (or measured)
value of soil density p to back-compute G' using Eq. (20-15). With some attention to details
the computed G' will probably not be in error more than ±25 percent—but it can be as much
as 100 percent.
Mayne and Rix (1995) suggest a correlation using either a seismic cone or a piezocone
with qc corrected for pore pressure to qj in the following form:
G' = 995XP" X<*T ( k p a ) ( 2 0 . 1 7 c )

of about 101.4 kPa) is sufficiently precise; qj and the in situ void ratio e have been previously
defined. The n-exponent for e has a value ranging from 1.13 to 1.3. For pa = 100 kPa, qj =
18OkPa, en = (wGs)n = 1.08113, Eq. (20-176) gives G' = 13 683 kPa (13.7 MPa).
Alternatively, you may convert qc from the CPT to an equivalent SPT TV using Eq. (3-20);
adjust this Af to A^o and use Eqs. (20-17) to obtain Vs then use Eq. (20-15) to compute G'.
Poisson's ratio is more troublesome, however, since a difference between jx = 0.3 and 0.4
can result in about 16 percent error in computing the soil spring.
20-5.3 Soil or Material Damping Ratio D1
Soil damping, defined here as the ratio of Eq. (20-3), i.e., actual damping, c//critical soil
damping, cci,
Dt = — X 100 (%)
Cci
is usually estimated in the range of 0 to about 0.10 (0 to 10 percent). This damping ratio range
has been suggested by Whitman and Richart (1967), who compiled values from a number of
sources available at that time including Barkan (1962).
The recent work of Stewart and Campanella (1993) reasonably validates the earlier range
of values. However, they also suggested that although the damping ratio is frequency- (as
well as material-) dependent, it can be estimated in about the following range:

Damping Dz, %
Soil Type S & C (1993) Summary of Others

Clay 1.0 to 5 1.7 to 7
Silt 2.5
Alluvium 3.5 to 12
Sand 0.5 to 2 1.7 to 6

The use of D/, % is consistent with the S & C (1993) reference, but for use in such as
Eq. (20-4), Dt is a decimal, i.e., 1.0/100 = 0.01, 5/100 = 0.05, etc. The values in the table
above are suggested for the vertical-mode damping ratio Dz. Values will seldom be the same
for sliding (Dx or Dy) and rotational (De) modes.

20-6 UNBALANCED MACHINE FORCES
The unbalanced forces from the machinery, engines, or motors and their location with respect
to some reference point from the machine base are required. The manufacturer must supply


this information for machinery and motors. The project engineer would have to obtain it in
some manner if the vibrations are from wind gusts and such.
To illustrate the concept of an engine producing both primary and secondary forces we will
briefly examine the single-cylinder engine idealized in Fig. 20-9. We define zp = downward
displacement of the piston from zero (when cot = 0) at top dead center; maximum zp occurs
at cot = TT rad counterclockwise. At any time t we have for cot as shown
Zp = r(l - cosa>0 + L(I - cos a)
but a = f(cot) since yc is common to both r and L so that
r .
sin a = — smcot

Using a number of trigonometric relationships [see Den Hartog (1952)], we finally obtain

Figure 20-9 Moving parts of a single-cylinder engine
producing unbalanced frequency-dependent forces.

(20-18)

Cylinder -

Piston

L = connecting rod
r = crank rod

Crankshaft


A similar exercise can be done for the crank to obtain
yc = -rsincot zc = A*(1 — C O S G > 0 ]
yc = — rco cosiot zc = rcosincot > (20.19)
yc = rco smcot zc = rco cos cot J
Designating the mass of the piston plus a part of the connecting rod as the vertical recip-
rocating mass mrec concentrated at point C and that of the crank plus the remainder of the
connecting rod as the rotating mass mrot concentrated at D, we obtain the unbalanced forces
as
Vertical: Fz = mTeczp + mrotyc
r2co2
Fz = (mrec + mrot)r(i>2 coscot + mrec Tl cos2cot (20-20)
Horizontal: Fy = mmyc = mrotr(o2 sin cot (20-21)
From these forces we have in Eq. (20-20) two parts:
A primary force: = (mrec + mTOt)r(o2 cos a>t
A secondary force: = mrec 2 cos loot

These are vertical primary and secondary forces and are a maximum at cot = 2(ot = 0 and
multiples of IT SO that the cosine term = 1 with the same sign. Note that these forces are
frequency-dependent, so the forces are larger at, say, 3000 r/min (rpm) than at 2000 rpm.
Equation (20-21) gives a horizontal primary force; there is no secondary force because
there is only one term. This force is a maximum at cot = TT/4, 5TT/4, etc., and will be at
some distance y above the center of the base-ground interface and will therefore produce
a rocking moment about the x axis (which is perpendicular to the plane of the paper and
passes through point O of Fig. 20-9). In this case the horizontal force produces both a sliding
mode and a rocking mode. As we will see in the next section these two modes are generally
interdependent or coupled.
Most motors have more than one cylinder, and manufacturers attempt to keep the unbal-
anced forces small (use small r and masses; have one crank rotate counterclockwise while
another is rotating clockwise, etc.). Although it is possible to minimize the unbalanced forces
and resulting rocking moments they are never completely eliminated.
Computational procedures can be used to obtain the unbalanced forces but as this simple
example illustrates the work is formidable (for example, how does one allocate L between mrot
and mrec?). For this reason equipment manufacturers use electronic data acquisition equip-
ment such as displacement transducers and accelerometers located at strategic points on the
machinery to measure displacements and accelerations at those points for several operational
frequencies (or rpm's). These data can be used to back-compute the forces since the total
machine mass can be readily obtained by weighing. Using these methods, we can directly
obtain the unbalanced forces without using the mass of the several component parts.
These data should be requested from the manufacturer in order to design the equipment
base for any vibration control. We should also note that in case the base does not function as
intended (vibrations too large or machinery becomes damaged) it is usual to put displacement
transducers and accelerometers on the installation to ascertain whether the foundation was
improperly designed or whether the manufacturer furnished incorrect machinery data.


20-7 DYNAMIC BASE EXAMPLE
Now that we have identified the soil properties and machine forces and other data needed to
solve Eq. (20-4a) or (20-4b) we can use this information for the following example.

Example 20-1. Use the computer program FADDYNFl on your computer diskette and data set
EXAM201.DTA and obtain the six displacements for the base as shown in Fig. E20-la. Note that
rocking modes will be about the center of area both in plan and elevation (B, L, 7^/2). The following
data are given:
Soil: G' = 239 400 kPa
Damping factor: D1 = 0.05 (estimated—see Sec 20-5.3; same for all modes)
ys = 19.65 kN/m3
/JL = 0.333 (estimated)
Machine: rpm = 900 (operating speed)
For purposes of illustration we will only use the primary forces.
F0x = 45 kN = Foy (horizontal for sliding)
Foz = 90 kN (vertical)
M0x = 20.3 kN • m (about x axis)
Moy = 27.1 kN • m (about y axis)
Moz = 33.9 kN • m (about z axis)

Solution. Compute the remaining parameters. Note that we will only make a solution for the operat-
ing speed of 900 rpm for cases 2 through 7 (Example 20-la-fon your diskette file EXAM201 .DTA).
The special case of Example 20-Ia is provided to illustrate the case of frequency-dependent forces.
In this case we have a frequency-dependent vertical force F0 = 90 kN at 900 rpm. In these exam-
ples we are not inputting any secondary forces or secondary moments—although they usually exist

in most rotating equipment. If you have any, you would input them when asked by the program
when the data file is first being built.
When F0 is of the form F = F0 sin cot, it is only necessary to look at the maximum F0 that occurs
at cot = TT/2 and the program option control parameter IFORC = 1 (it is 2 for Example 20-Ia).
In most real cases we would probably set the range of rpm from about 100 or 200 up to about
1200, which includes the operating speed. This is usually necessary since no machine suddenly
starts spinning at 900 rpm with a constant force F0; it is possible an rpm rate between 0 and 900
produces a larger displacement than one at 900 rpm (i.e., resonance with damping occurs). Note
how the data were set up for Example 20-Ia. One can write
F0 = 2meyco2
but this expression is equivalent to the following:

Dynamic displacement Yp must be computed using Eq. (20-4Z?); dynamic springs, using Kz = T](Ki',
and damping constants, using c/ = A1-c,- [see Eqs. (20-9) and (20-10)]. These dynamic values are
then used in Eq. (20-4Z?) to find zt/(Fo/Kz) = V = Yp/Ys and Yp = VYS, with both values shown
on the output sheet.
If you check Fig. E20-1& for the output labeled Example 20-IA you will find that the several
"constants" and the line of data for 900 rpm are exactly the same as in Example 20-IA-A even
though the program computed first for 800 rpm. This small check demonstrates that the program
is working correctly. Also since 1000 rpm gives a larger vertical displacement, it would appear the
resonance frequency is above 900 rpm.

locate the center of mass of the component parts and locate the unbalanced machine forces.
With the eg located and the forces Fy and M acting, we can replace the system with the
block base of Fig. 20-10fe. From the figure geometry we can write by inspection the base
movement (needed since this is what develops base-to-soil resistance) yb from the translation
at the eg of yg as
yD = yg — ho0 = net base translation
% = Jg ~ KO {a)
The net base translation yD produces a sliding resistance Py as
Py = cyyb + Kyyb (b)
The base rotational resistance (and using single subscripts to simplify the equations but noting
6 should be interpreted as 6y> for example, IQ is actually Iey) is as for uncoupled cases

Summing horizontal forces through the eg, we have
myg + Py = Fy (d)
Summing moments about the eg and noting the base resistance Py produces an additional
moment to consider, we obtain
I6Q + R6- hoPy = M (e)
Now substituting for Pyy R6, yt, and y^, we obtain
myg + Cyyg + Kyyg - ho(Ky6 + cy6) = F0 cos cot (20-22)
I6O + (c6 + h2ocy)6 + (K6 + h2oKy)6 - ho(cyyg + Kyyg) = M (20-23)
Coupling can now be identified from all terms containing ho. If ho = 0 these two equa-
tions would reduce to the basic (or uncoupled) form of Eq. (f) of Sec. 20-2. Also note that a
vertical force anywhere on the base is not coupled to rocking even if it produces a moment
from eccentricity with respect to the eg. If the presence of ho produces coupling, the effects
evidently reduce with ho and was the reason for analyzing Example 20-1 using a 0.31 m thick
base giving ho = 0.155 m.
Also note that the moment and Fy are always in phase (act so results are cumulative). In
this case the center of rotation would always be below the eg. If they are out of phase the
center of rotation will lie somewhere along a vertical line through the eg and may be above
this point depending on the relative magnitude of the translation and moment forces.
With rocking taking place about the eg you will have to use the transfer formula (shown
on Fig. 20-1) when computing I6i as necessary. For example, I6y and I6x of Fig. 20-10Z? will
require use of the transfer formula component md2, and it is possible that I6z will require its
use as well. The axis subscript is about that axis, not parallel with it.
With reference to Eqs. (20-22) and (20-23) it is convenient to write the displacements in
complex form (e = 2.71828...) as follows:

Force Rotation
yg = (X1 + iX2)ei(at 6 = (X3 + iX4)eiMt
yg = O)(IX1 - X2)eiMt 0 = a>(iX3 ~ X4)eil0t
yg = -W2CX1 + iX2)eiu)t d = -a)2(X3 + iX4)eiu)t

The process of substituting these displacement functions into Eqs. (20-22) and (20-23), sim-
plifying, and collecting real and imaginary terms for Eq. (20-22) gives two equations in the
four values of X1-. Similarly, the real and imaginary terms of Eq. (20-23) give two equations
in the four values of X1-. These equations are given as follows:
(real part)
(imag. part)

(real part)

(imag. part)

(20-24)


These equations can be programmed to give the unknowns Xi, which are then used to obtain
the displacements (noting the complex definition of displacements) as
yg = Vxi+*2 e = Jxl+ xj (20-25)
Note Xi, X2 = translations of m, ft, etc. and X3, X4 = rotations in radians. Since the springs
and damping constants are frequency-dependent it is usually necessary to cycle the problem
using the range of values of co from 0 to somewhat above the operating frequency (oo (or rpm)
for the "worst" case.
Secondary forces that are out of phase will require a second computer analysis with the
rotations and displacements summed with the primary values and giving careful attention
to signs. In-phase secondary forces (or select in-phase values) can simply be added to the
primary forces for direct analysis.
A Computer Program
The computer program used in Example 20-1 was modified (see B-29) with some effort for
allowing a coupling analysis.

20-9 EMBEDMENT EFFECTS ON DYNAMIC
BASE RESPONSE
The previous methods of analysis considered the dynamic base on the ground surface. Most
bases supporting machinery will be embedded some depth into the ground so as to be founded
on more competent soil below the zone of seasonal volume change.
It is generally accepted from both a theoretical analysis and field measurements that plac-
ing the base into the ground affects the system response to excitation forces. It appears that
embedment tends to increase the resonant frequency and may decrease the amplitude.
Several methods to account for vertical vibration exist, including those of Novak and Bere-
dugo (1972), Dobry and Gazetas (1985), and as attributed to Whitman by Arya et al. (1979).
Those of Novak and Beredugo and in Arya et al. are for round bases and will not be used here
since rectangular base response is substantially different.
The Arya et al. (1979) reference is the only one the author located purporting to allow for
rocking and sliding as well as vertical excitation. It is suggested, however, that rocking and
sliding spring adjustments for depth should be used cautiously—if at all—for these reasons:
1. Rocking of the base into the side soil may produce a gap over time.
2. Sliding of the base into the side soil may produce gaps over time.
3. The space around the base would have to be carefully backfilled and compacted to provide
any appreciable side resistance unless the excavation was excavated and the base poured
without using concrete forms.
4. It is not uncommon, where wooden concrete forms are used, to leave them in place.
5. A slight adjustment for depth is automatically accounted for since the effective normal
stress at a depth is larger [see Eqs. (20-12) through (20-13)] so that G' is larger. This in
turn increases the computed soil springs.
The method given by Dobry and Gazetas (1985) is suggested, however, for the vertical
vibration mode spring, as it is both rational and applicable to rectangular- (and other-) shaped
bases. Referring to Fig. 20-11, we may define the vertical dynamic spring as the product of
K'z = Kzx Ktre X Kwaii (20-26)


(b) Radiation damping.

where Kz = static spring computed using the formula given in Table 20-2
Ktre = factor > 1 from a curve-fitting scheme from the base being at the bottom of
a trench (the excavation), given as
*« = 1 + 2^(1 + ^ ) (2°-27)
K wail = factor > 1 from contact of base sides against soil—either backfill or original
ground given as

"wan = 1 + 0 . 1 9 1 - ^ J (20-28)

with As = area of sides of base in contact with side soil and gives for a
rectangular base of 2B X 2L X Tb
As =2Tb(2B + 2L) A = 2B X 2L
This is the more theoretical form given by the reference and is recommended as it allows
adjustment in the side contact area As. For example, we might compute As and decide, based
on a site study, to use only 0.25, 0.50, or some other fraction rather than the full value. For
damping it is suggested to use the computed damping + addition of side damping as

Example 20-2. Assume the base of Example 20-1 is 1 m in the ground. What are the revised
values of the static spring and damping coefficient c'z [which are then used to compute the dynamic
value(s)]?

Solution. From the computer printout obtain the surface static spring as Kz = .43049E4-7. Also
2B = 3.66 m. 2L = 7.32 m giving Ja = 0.5 (computed in example) and A — 26.8 m2. As =
2 X 0.31 X (3.66 + 7.32) = 6.8 m2. We will assume As is 50 percent effective so use A5 = 3.4 m2.
Substituting into Eq. (20-27), we obtain for D = I m and B = 3.66 m
K - = 1 + 2T^6)(1 + l ( a 5 ) ) = L ° 2
Substituting into Eq. (20-28) gives
/ 3 4 \a67
Kwall = l+0.19( — j = 1.05

from which the static spring adjusted for embedment is
K'z = KzKtTeKwaU = A3049E + 7(1.02)(1.05) = .46105E+7 kN/m
The damping constant, being directly additive, gives
c'z = cz + pVsAs (where As = 3.4 m2 as previously used)
= .18553E+5 + 2 x 346 x 3.4 = .20906E+5

////
From Fig. 20-11 we note that the base sliding or rocking against the side soil could be
similarly accommodated for damping as for the vertical mode. For spring adjustments we
could do the following:

For sliding. This is equivalent to vertical vibration rotated 90°, so we might compute a
horizontal spring using the vertical spring equations and place it (or a fraction) in parallel
with the horizontal spring.
For rocking. This is equivalent to base rocking, so compute the side equivalent rocking
value (2B = base thickness rocking against side soil) and put this spring in parallel with the
base rocking spring.
Springs in parallel are directly additive as
Ki0{ = K1+K2 (20-30)
Springs in series are

20-10 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS IN DESIGNING
DYNAMIC BASES
Experience has provided some guidelines for the analysis of foundation blocks to con-
trol vibrations. Other guides may be obtained from carefully analyzing Eq. (20-4«) or by
making a series of parametric studies using the provided computer program. Some particular


considerations are as follows:

1. If a dynamic analysis predicts a resonance condition at the operating frequency fo you
must increase or decrease the mass or alter the spring constant. Even if the resonance
amplitude is acceptable we do not want to have fo = /r . It is usually suggested to keep
fo at least ±20 percent from fr.
2. Try to adjust the base so the center of gravity of equipment and block are coincident. Doing
this provides reasonably uniform soil pressure and static settlement.
Proportion the base dimension for about half the allowable static soil bearing-capacity
pressure. The static H- dynamic pressure should not be much over 75 percent of the allow-
able static pressure.
4. Use as wide a base as possible to resist rocking. Try to use a width that is greater than or
equal to zo to 1.15zo of Fig. 20-1Oa. Rocking about the narrow dimension will very likely
produce vibration amplitudes that are too large. Also the edge pressures may be excessive,
so the base eventually tilts.
5. Use a base thickness of at least 0.6 m to produce a "rigid" foundation, in line with the
general theory used to develop Eq. (20-4a).
6. Use a machinery/block (WnJWb) mass ratio of 2 to 3 for centrifugal machinery and 3 + for
reciprocating equipment.
7. Try to provide a 300-mm clearance all around the machinery frame for any maintenance
or other requirements.

It is seldom necessary to use high-strength concrete for vibrating bases since mass is usu-
ally more critical than strength; however, /c' < 21 MPa is not recommended.
When a foundation is designed and put into service and problems develop, a question
arises of what remedial action to take. Often a first step is to check if increasing the mass
will solve the problem. A temporary mass increase can be made by use of sandbags placed
on the block (symmetrically to maintain uniform soil pressure). Other alternatives consist in
stiffening the base soil by drilling holes through the base (if not too thick) and injecting grout
into the underlying soil in a zone up to about 3B in depth.
In many cases the problem can be solved by a combination of increasing the mass and the
base area. This can be fairly easy to accomplish by simply pouring a perimeter enlargement
that is well-bonded (using dowels) to the original base—often without having to take the
machine out of service. Contrary to some opinion, concrete will harden while being vibrated
(at low amplitudes)—and usually will have some strength gain from the greater resulting
density and slightly lowered w/c ratio.

20-11 PILE-SUPPORTED DYNAMIC FOUNDATIONS
When the soil is loose or soft, or when it is necessary to alter the foundation frequency, piles
may be used. Intuitively, one sees that piles provide a greater apparent soil stiffness; and for
the same supported mass m it is evident from
[K
(X)n = J —
Y m
that an increase in K also increases the natural frequency con of the foundation block.


The piles provide additional spring and damping contributions to the system, so some
means is necessary to incorporate the significant properties of the two materials into equiva-
lent springs and damping factors. When we do this we can then use Eq. (20-4a) to obtain the
solution (or the coupling concepts) for that vibration mode.
There are few theories and even fewer reported data from field performance studies on full-
scale dynamically loaded bases supported by pile foundations. For this reason the theories
are substantially uncertain; however, rational estimates are better than simply guessing at the
response.
It is generally accepted that using piles will:

1. Decrease geometric (or radiation) damping
2. Increase the resonant frequency fr and may also increase /„
3. Influence the amplitude near resonance
4. When laterally loaded, produce dynamic responses that are uncertain to estimate

The principal effort in dynamic pile analyses has been undertaken by and under the direc-
tion of the late Professor M. Novak at the University of Western Ontario, Canada. The basic
theory is given by Novak (1974) and Novak and Ho well (1977) for torsion. The dynamic
pile equations of Novak (1974) are of the following general form using Novak's notation and
noting / = v — 1:
Horizontal and rocking: G'(SUf\ + iSUy2)u(z, t)dz = F(t)
Vertical: G'(SwA + iSWt2)w(z, t)dz = F(t)
The parameters Stj depend on Poissons' ratio \x and xo = aojq = [ro(x)Jq\/Vs. Terms
are defined in the following list if not identified here. The term q is given as
1 -2/i,
q ~ 2 - 2 / *
From using / = J-I we can see the Suj factors are complex and in the original derivation
include Hankel functions of the second kind of orders 0, 1, and 2 based on ao and xo.
The Swj factors are also complex and include Bessel functions of order 0 and 1 based
on ao and xo. It is convenient to program the Bessel and Hankel function computations as
subroutines to obtain the Stj functions without having to use charts, tables, or curve-fitting
schemes. This step is done in computer program B-30.
The following list of variables are also significant problem parameters:
Ep = modulus of elasticity of pile
G' = shear modulus of soil (and depends on JJL)
7P> 7s — unit weights of pile material and soil, respectively
Vp, Vs = shear wave velocities in pile and soil respectively [for the pile compute Vp =
jEp/p\ for the soil use Eq. (20-15)]
Lp/ro = ratio of pile length L^/effective radius of pile ro
ro = effective radius of pile = radius of round pile and the equivalent for a square or
rectangular pile computed as ro = Jarea/rr


ao — dimensionless frequency factor previously used but here defined as
ao = (oro Jq/Ws\ q = Poisson ratio value previously defined; co is same as
used in Eq. (20-4)
One must use consistent units, and with ao as a problem parameter it is evident the pile
springs and damping constants will be frequency-dependent since a0 is used to obtain the
Sij factors.
The general solution is only practical by using a computer program to develop the nec-
essary constants for use in the stiffness and damping constants. Novak (1974) provides a
number of curves and a table of some values, but invariably a practical problem requires
interpolation or falls out of the table range. The references give the necessary information
so that one can produce a computer program, but it will have to be written in a computer
programming language, which allows manipulation of complex variables.
Solutions are provided for all six degrees of freedom of the base with proper interpretation
and for piles with the head fixed in the base and the lower end either pinned or fixed. It
appears that for the pile lengths (in terms of the Lp/ro ratio) likely to be used the fixed lower
end case will occur for nearly all cases. The theoretical solutions for the fixed lower end and
the pinned lower end converge at about Lp/ro = 25 to 30. The solution produces factors fa
that are multipliers to obtain the actual spring and damping constants. Generally these fu
constants depend on the following:

Parameter Amount of dependency
WsIWp Considerable as illustrated in Table 20-6
Lp/r0 Not much for Lp/ro > 25
H Not much, e.g., for Ws/Wp = 0.030 and Lp/ro > 25,
M /l8,l A l
0.25 0.0373 0.339
0.33 0.0373 0.345
0.40 0.0373 0.351
ao Substantial—particularly above 0.50

Table 20-7 lists the spring and damping constants computed using the fu constants given
in Table 20-6 for a typical concrete pile.
When the spring and damping constants are computed for a single pile it is necessary
somehow to concentrate the several piles to an equivalent total or global spring and damp-
ing coefficient that, together with the block mass m, are used in Eq. (20-4a) to compute
displacement amplitudes and other data. There are conflicting opinions on how to make the
summing process. Most persons agree that if the pile spacing ratio s/D is greater than 5
or 6 one can make a summation by simply adding the individual pile contributions (where
the piles are all similar and there are n piles the global spring = n X ^Tpile and global
damping = n X cpiie). When the s/D ratio is less, there is opinion that corner piles con-
tribute more than side piles and side piles contribute more than interior piles. A method
suggested by Poulos (1979) has been noted by Novak (1974) and suggested by Arya et
al. (1979). Others having used the Poulos (1979) method have found it does not predict

displacement amplitudes very well. The method does, however, consider interior piles to
contribute less resistance than exterior and corner piles. Since the Poulos method does not
predict very well and it is fairly computationally intensive, the author suggests either doing
nothing but sum values or considering the following approach if s/D is less than
about 3.5:

1. When displacement piles are driven the soil densities in the vicinity of the pile. The den-
sification is more concentrated at the interior of a pile group than around the exterior piles.
This suggests that we should use a base factor G' for the soil (prior to the pile insertion

process) and increase it some amount for side piles (perhaps use a factor of 1.1 to 1.25).
Interior piles might be increased by a factor of 1.25 to 1.5. Call this factor A.
2. Solve a typical interior pile of the group using G" = G'/4, a side pile using the interme-
diate G", and the corner piles using G'. Inspection of Table 20-7 indicates this action will
give reduced springs and damping constants for the interior compared to the sides and
corner piles.
3. Now make a summation by adding all the interior springs + all the side springs + all the
corner springs to obtain the global spring. Make a similar sum for the damping.
4. Use this global spring and damping value with the block mass m in Eq. (20-4a) to obtain
data for that frequency co.
Piles also have internal damping /3j. As a first approximation we may estimate the damp-
ing ratio D on the order of 0.05 to 0.10 and use Eqs. (20-9) and (20-10) to adjust the spring
and damping coefficients. A global adjustment is about the best the problem data can gen-
erally justify; however, you may make individual pile adjustments where reliable problem
parameters are used.
Example 20-3. Compute the several single-pile spring and damping constants for the pile-
supported block of Fig. E20-3. Use the vertical spring and damping values to compute the dis-
placement in the vertical mode using Eq. (20-4a).

With these data and the large s/D ratio = 1.8/0.3 = 6, the vertical spring and damping constants

Comments.

1. The first term under the square root is negative, so it appears that the vertical displacement can
be reduced most economically by either increasing o) or the damping cz. Reducing the vertical
force would also reduce the displacement, but this is probably not possible.
2. The soil velocity Vs should be reduced, but this approach is also not possible. Increasing the soil
density ps usually increases G's, so soil improvement does not appear to be a solution.
3. Adding piles does not appear to be a good solution, but increasing the base thickness to increase
m may be of some aid. Increasing pile size to 600 X 600 mm would reduce the s/B to 3 and would
not be of much help—even if it were possible to reduce pile length (so Lp/ro ~ 31 or 32).
4. We do not know the static displacement; however, we may obtain coefficients at ao —> 0 that
would approximate "static" values for computing the natural system frequency and critical
damping if that is desired.

GENERAL COMMENTS ON USING PILES.

1. Probably the best piles to use are concrete piles or pipe piles filled with concrete. Where
wood piles are available they might be used to some advantage. HP piles are not a good
choice for vibration control.
2. Use as large a pile spacing as possible—preferably s/D > 5 where D = pile diameter or
width.
3. Use low pile stresses. A rule of thumb is to limit static stresses to not more than one-half
the allowable design stress for the pile material. The pile stresses in Example 20-3 are
quite low at 4.12/(9 X 0.09) = 5.09 MN.
4. Pile cap (or block) mass should be about 1.5 to 2.5 X mass of centrifugal machines and
2.5 to 4 X mass of reciprocating machines.
5. Arrange the centroid of the pile group to coincide with the centroid of the block mass as
closely as practicable.
6. Consider batter piles with large horizontal dynamic forces. Here we could compute the
axial spring of the batter pile and use the horizontal component together with the horizontal
springs of the vertical piles in the group.
7. Be sure the cap is well anchored to the piles. Use shear connectors in combination with at
least 300 mm of pile embedment.
8. The soil properties—particularly G'—after driving the piles will be substantially different
from those obtained initially. Unless you can somehow determine the parameters after the
piles have been installed for use in the equations given here, great refinement in spring
and damping coefficients for use in Eq. (2Q-Aa) is not necessary, and the equations and
methodology given are satisfactory. Note, too, that it would be difficult to determine the
parameters after driving by the down-hole or cross-hole method if the shear waves travel
through both pile and soil to the detection unit.

PROBLEMS
20-1. Use your computer program FADDYNFl and compute a value of Fz (refer to Example 20-1)
that would increase the given displacement by a factor of 8. To do this, make a copy of data set
EXAM201 .DTA and then separate the several different vibration modes into separate disk files.
Revise the set labeled EXAMPLE 20-1A-A and make several copies of the file with different
forces F1 and make a plot of z versus F1 to find the resonant value.
20-2. Using your computer program, make a parametric study of the effect of G' on the vertical mode
of Example 20-1. That is, make a plot of G' versus z for 50, 75, and 150 percent of the given
G' = 23940OkPa.
20-3. Use your computer program as in Problem 20-2 but for the sliding mode parallel to the x axis.
20-4. Use your computer program as in Problem 20-2 but for the rocking mode about the z axis.
20-5. A single-cylinder engine weighs 24.15 kN. The unbalanced vertical forces are these: primary
= 18.50 kN, secondary = 9.75 kN, at the operating speed of 1600 rpm. The soil is a very
sandy clay with qu = 250 kPa. Find the amplitude of vibration for the system using a con-
crete foundation block 1.2 X 2.4 X 1.0 m thick. Find the displacements in the range of rpm
from 0 to 1800. (Assume this is a mey(o2 type with the above vertical forces occurring at 1200
rpm.) Use increments of 100 rpm. If you find the resonance frequency is in the operating range,
make a second run starting at 100 rpm before resonance to 100 rpm beyond, using increments
of 25 rpm.


20-6. Estimate the revised lateral spring and damping for Example 20-2.
20-7. Compute the estimated horizontal displacement of Example 20-3 for a dynamic lateral force of
50 kN acting 1.5 m above the block base at ground line. Should coupling be considered in this
case?
20-8. Referring to Example 20-3, we know that Vs/Vp = 0.06. Back-compute the corresponding soil
G', recompute the vertical soil springs K1 and damping cz, and compute the resulting vertical
displacement z. Can you draw any conclusions about the effect of G' on this class of problems?
20-9. Redo Example 20-3 for the displacement mode assigned if the frequency is either 149.2 or 209.2
rad/sec (also as assigned). Compare the spring value to that in the example, which uses 179.2
rad/sec. Does frequency co appear to have a significant effect on the displacements? Hint: Com-
pare 1/square root term computed using the example springs and co and your springs and co.
20-10. Write a short computer program and verify Figs. 20-4.


Representative steel and prestressed pile data are provided for the book user. The HP pile
data are similar to those in the AISC Steel Construction Manual except for the addition of
Algoma sections. The sheetpiling data are generally representative of those available both in
the United States and elsewhere. The pipe piling data are only a partial list of available di-
ameters and wall thicknesses. The prestressed pile data are a partial list of available sections.
The SI conversions have been made by the author based on the best currently available
data on nominal section sizes and rounding. The European sections dimensions are as given
by them except where values have been provided in centimeters—a non-SI term. Generally
the use of section values in meters (m) with a 10"" where n = 3 or 6 is the best format since
the exponential term can usually be canceled without even having to write it down. Using
millimeters gives numbers too large to write, and decimal shifting is difficult.
Because of the great difficulty in finding sources (some trade organizations charge for a
list of manufacturers), I have elected to provide addresses for pile hammer manufacturers
and the address of at least one producer of HP piles, sheet piles, pipe piles, and concrete
piles. Although these addresses are correct at the time of publication (I did not include any
representatives' addresses), no warranty can be made that they will remain correct for the
life of this publication.

The proceedings of ICSMFE are not much cited, because they are extremely expensive (if
available—usually by A. A. Balkema, P.O. Box 1675, Rotterdam, Netherlands) and are avail-
able only at a few university libraries, if they are not out of print. Most material of much im-
portance usually gets published in less expensive ASCE conference publications or in ASCE
JGED or the CGJ.
